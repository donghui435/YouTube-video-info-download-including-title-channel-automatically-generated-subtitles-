hello professor v welcome u previous lecture explore example number used primarily counting counting cal led natural natural start one count arbitrarily large seen numeral one many possible ways represent natural system eventually modern decimal number system positional notation ten decimal number system found superior ancient system simple rule create number sin decimal system ten symbol cal led depending column occupy represent quantity make number positional notation column multiplier digit example decimal system value rightmost digit digit next column left next digit value number sum times example value decimal number times times times times positional notation column multiplier differ adjacent column constant multiple cal led base number system decimal system column multiplier ten times previous column therefore decimal system cal led number system infinite number column decimal number system column multiplier ten times bigger column right however writing number front normally written count column reach column start column continue counting column count number times column passe word column register number continue reach point column start hundred column positional notation system simple every time column next column left increment show ended number system based multiple good reason choosing ten number fact people ten finger sand probably originally communicate cartoon character four possible cartoon land everyone number system based multiple eight instead ten would number system work eight symbol instead ten decimal instead symbol used symbol similar counting decimal since symbol highest quantity column eighth item cause column start next column increment second column count number number following look like decimal number ten comes get point go second column two eight sixteen continue like get highest number represent two point eight column start third column third column represent eight eight column multiplier eight times previous one every number written decimal also written counting way completely different easy convert number decimal consider positional notation works let take example number decimal value number sum times number times times times add quantity decimal cal led may sometimes see small subscript decimal number case may confusion base used digital computer use electronic circuit cal led represent flip flop store single bit represent either combined represent binary number binary number system two binary column multiplier two times multiplier previous digit like decimal value binary number sum times either calculation simple add multiplier column contain example binary number sixteen plus eight plus two equal though digital computer store binary quite tedious write remember large binary instance number one million binary one one one zero one zero one one zero zero one one zero one one zero zero zero zero early history digital found easier use notation deal long string binary single symbol easy memorize eight possible combination three binary convert multiple digit number binary digit number converted binary equivalent binary combined single binary number leading removed convert binary number thing reverse convert binary number back split group starting right group converted equivalent symbol equivalent binary number lot easier remember computer storage normally organized group cal led many computer prefer use known hexa decimal hex instead hexa decimal every group four convert single hex symbol two hex symbol represent exactly one require represent given number easy convert back forth use sixteen symbol used decimal six symbol making new symbol letter f used represent call ten fifteen decimal counting hexa decimal works way decimal hex sixteen symbol per digit column multiplier sixteen times previous represent large number swith decimal counting getting f decimal go decimal reach go decimal get number represent two hex go decimal hex notation four binary single hex symbol sixteen possible combination four bit sis equivalent single hex convert binary number hex starting right group group group binary converted equivalent hex symbol seen natural number two eight ten symbol sand sixteen matter choose write natural number still represent quantity seen use basic rule counting difference base different number positional notation create number system natural base like try one know might catch
