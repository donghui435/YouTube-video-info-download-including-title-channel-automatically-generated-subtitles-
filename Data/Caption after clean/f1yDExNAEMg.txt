well mathematician like tube often inspired stuff see tube recently saw two clips gave idea want tell impressive sure dont anything else march thats main occupation right impressive found even impressive people competition thats really impressive anyway idea basically square around obviously mathematician like square like circle like sort thing thought well maybe want idea two identical square kind around wan ted kind devise sort choreography two one big huge square imagine two square kind around eventually kind come together whoops see like one big square good idea let let see whether first thing figure big want make square could start really really small like going look right weve got four another four total eight need square number right thats going work right cant really go really small next size three times three three times three thats nine thats nine together thats square number going work let keep thats square number plus actually pretty one anyway let keep searching eventually got find something hopefully already pretty close let use actually going work eventually going work want something small near miss right squared squared squared squared also one right good enough actually show us whats going happen let worry actually finding right keep going choreography going actually merge two square together also thing want say since much trouble finding going use example eventually going important later let say example exist going choreography going merge two square together go going march square actually kind template us see actually go eventually blue dot fit grid going march two square left right like theyre going overlap middle bit problem maybe really stand comrade right basically double red point doubled mean square seeing nobody standing theres one person standing blue every one red two people doubled right take guy standing fit empty square right eventually know whatever start supposed fill spot right mean course red square exactly big two little together right thats logical conclusion right one plus one equal well thats great theres something really really really strange star ted saying example two identical smaller square combine square found even smaller one show possible thats supposed example found even smaller think actually way resolve paradox say well example example cant smaller example basically start assumption find example show us kind paradox contradiction show us cant example actually way merge two identical square square thats shown actually mathematics cal led proof contradiction assume something case make logical deduction come point see theres nonsense something thats true nonsense cant follow mean star ted nonsense first place mean whatever opposite assumed true case two identical square possibly combine two square alright also express mathematically algebraically two integer square cant add another integer square like transform little bit times squared equal n squared doesnt work divide one cant work square root see one cant work say square root written fraction fraction integer say square root irrational actually square scenario square consideration also show square root two right else say actually near miss example used squared plus squared equal squared minus mean use illustration actually really going nice symmetric way theres something nice coming want show one kind march square way get overlap righto kay actually star ted mean exact green bit exactly big two combine together since star ted near miss well closed close actually check weve got one two three four five weve got one two three four five six seven thats near miss kind already beginning square plus squared equal seven squared plus one stop right move two guy middle theyre going create see get well weve got two squared two squared thats eight one nine thats another near miss right get another near miss else dont stop really simple one still near miss squared plus squared equal squared plus one one near miss es kind know get sort near miss es kind repeat procedure really really quite fun actually get smaller also kind go backwards go backwards actually get near miss es let go backwards kind go like unmerge right put square get us back beginning want next higher next bigger near miss put big square around thislike measure wide theres another square inside measure far squared plus squared equal squared plus take two square arrange like put big square around get another example another example another example actually going two another square difference couple example theres heaps left side near also really nice another way let example look actually look fraction get get get one think happening well theyre getting closer closer square root one actually really really really really good approximation square root mean people always obsess pi like one thing know pi almost pi right actually looking fraction know square youd probably go one nobody know one play role square root play pi
