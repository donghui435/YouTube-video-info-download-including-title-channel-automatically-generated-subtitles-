section use law solve missing part sin triangle first problem solve triangle side side c angle b degree see drawn little picture right situation angle b included sides side c use law cosine solve side b law squared equal squared plus c squared minus c cosine angle b according law cosine going formula going use whatever side two sides right angle goes angle thats opposite side let fill situation squared going plus squared minus times times times cosine worked calculator calculator comes b squared equal five hundred twenty eight thousand seven hundred fourteen thats b squared take square root get b rounding three significant get seven hundred thats side b seven hundred twenty seven law use law cosine solve side b side b angle opposite solve either one two angle right since choice angle solve law let use law solve angle c first law going sine c looking side c sine degree set law solve sine c wont show work right put calculator get approximately inverse sine button calculator tell angle c must equal point degree point degree dont check angle c prime like would ambiguous case already angle triangle thats bigger degree going another obtuse angle theres need say minus point degree angle c angle c equal last thing find angle angle minus point five twelve point nine degree dive already worked also comes fifteen point six thats angle law cosine first angle two sides included side angle use law cosine find side office switch law find next angle subtract already degree sand third angle triangle solve completely next problem c angle well let draw little picture right help us b c see ill label side ill label side b ill label side c look diagram right know angle opposite longe st side see side angle going angle remember drawn scale drawn triangle something label going solve angle first law law cosine tell cosine angle b squared plus c squared minus squared divided c according law cosine write law way solve angle substitute ill see squared plus squared minus squared divided times worked calculator comes negative zero point six one seven seven negative zero point six one seven seven use inverse cosine button calculator whoops b angle comes pretty simple law find angle triangle going opposite longe st side law formula cosine substituting value get decimal right inverse cosine button calculator equal rounded nearest degree significant figure right thats look law cosine
