range easy calculate unfortunately data make range almost useless goback original question measure spread apart data without kind susceptible outlier problem least reduce sensitivity outlier problem answer question something extremely important statistics concept variance thats concept variance right done range figured going try calculate something cal led variance going tell us spread apart data way thats quite susceptible outlier thats important concept variance going tell right along standard deviation well get little bit concept variance never going leave statistics really need make sure like understanding mean important understanding variance extremely important instead equation variance could done going lead logical kind mean know equation variance also know gut really mean thats really need think thats really need internalize let say data set kind drawing picture could list could height people room could age people could know like peanut butter jelly oh doesnt really matter usually numerical data kind sake argument think people room something like weve learned course sofar bunch data calculate mean kind like value right kind like representative number kind goes cut right middle data set center gravity speak data set use notation talking data right sample mean way get add value sample divide number sample get number represent sample right wan ted look data point visualize cloud bunch data point know got data point different value kind mean wan ted look individual data point figure far mean kind measuring spread individual data point right remember trying trying figure spread data instead range end point want look every single data point set figure far away mean somehow roll calculation calculate variance spread data going examine one point one point right would find point data point deviation simple nothing complicated data value minus mean mean thats simple right word data point want figure mean like want figure deviation mean data point going subtract take data point going subtract away mean thats going give far away got data point mean well going take going subtract tell far away point might think looking individual data mean nice indicator spread data would would right way might roll one calculation might want add little mean every single data point set see say x sub instead scare need think x sub ice data point maybe five data point sub one sub two said three four five individual see something like x sub minus average value mean x bar taking every data mean get number every single data point mean get add thats sigma add add data point divide number data point weve really done weve point going say incredibly important right weve done weve taken every data point subtract mean give us deviation every point set mean add divide number point deviation mean getting average value nice way average know variance calling mean give us spread data looking like range looking every point finding far away mean getting difference point equally weighted get number tell us get really big number tell us yeah lot far away mean get really small number calculation tell us yeah kind close mean deviation really small thats right let write couple going kind put page theave raging right final answer really want calculate variance theres one big problem thought process whats important going make one change well done problem notice data left hand side main data right hand side main going definition kind like center data set calculated value kind like center gravity data center kind theres point theres point thats always way mean right calculation written data point minus mean data point mean five data point greater five one data point might minus five another data point might ten minus five another data point might may know six minus five may twelve minus five could lots mean always subtract ing data value minus mean right look side mean data point actually smaller mean actually calculation going point minus mean five data point smaller five could three minus two minus five four minus five minus minus five four going get negative number top small number minus big number problem calculation even though perfect sense us half data point going give us negative value top half data point going us positive value top since together half data point going negative deviation half point going positive deviation sum together going always get want want find number spread data although make perfect logical sense subtract ing mean mean always always going get negative value son top along positive value sand always going end calculation cut chase going make small model vacation going call variance ill explain minute cal led variance right exactly written sigma x average value mean divided capital everything exactly make one change square guy right call variance fact going write population variance going circle important population variance something core know statistical concept really like study ing algebra learn x well statistics learn variance absolutely fundamentally central everything going everything follow need make sure understand weve done weve done exactly calculation logic spent lot time explaining true thing take sample value minus get number square getting deviation mean square data point mean five might six minus five seven month five eight ten minus five squaring difference right hand side get positive deviation going square theyre going get bigger left hand side negative issue pop know minus know minus would get negative value square squaring action make positive get deviation point mean square squaring first right fact might even make sense want could put little bracket around like kind show squaring action done addition every data point subtract mean square every data point add problem half negative value half positive nowhere leading zero matter data point always going get positive value top divide pot number still thing squaring first get around whole negative issue tal ked cal led variance symbol actually sigma let sigma also sigma letter cal led sigma letter sigma reason square us measure deviation calling variance case variance variance squared thats square remind tell calculate anything remind actually modeling variance data fall around mean spread apart weve kind actual difference weve squared everything didnt get zero answer common book see sigma squared place see sig symbol book asquare like need mentally head oh spread data bigger number whatever spread data smaller number closer data pac ked say closer pac ked mean closer pac ked around mean say farther spread apart farther spread apart mean right one thing want say close population variance population mean data point population thats population variance right dont forget business taking sample right sample probably never going know population going know rial take sample many times arrive squared choose different symbol right sample variance told long time ago need understand difference sample population reason exactly thing n minus right cal led sample variance notice theres one major difference theres two sample spread apart taken sample mean right sample mean x bar calculation reason n bottom number minus thats convention reason minus goes way beyond scope class need remember sample finite set sample n minus bottom calculation entire population disposal reason knew data point sin population would divide n total number people population one thing need modify description sho wed stuff trying kind make really clear since population variance instead x bar better way write way would see book minus mu right since population variance remember population population mean call mu sample mean call important thing lesson want try internalize trying understand follow next lesson going work actually trying calculate variance important thing know data going certain amount dispersion spread right talk spread really care spread apart mean thats really care right sample actual data youve gone collected sample mean know calculate difference every data point sample mean square divide number minus one give us something squared notice sample variance goes sample see squared know variance youve taken right thats calculation population everybody knew actual population mean knew every single data point population like every person united could calculate population variance sigma square calculation similar population case dividing number people population sample case dividing sample minus one fundamentally sort important thing need know see sigma squared like guy need think population variance talking population see squared like need think theyre talking sample weve taken thats took much make sure understand difference sample population sample mean population mean case calculation actually different population sample make sure understand follow next section get practice calculating thing find hard
