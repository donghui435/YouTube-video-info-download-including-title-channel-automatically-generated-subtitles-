hi rob welcome math antic sin lesson gon na learn something important foundation math l l encounter learning basic algebra gon na learn basically mean taking mathematical relationship turning friend welcome back joy gon na pick right left already nice beautiful function right needs friend gon na let put next point right need connect friend sand friend stay connected oh look beautiful well kind picture han g mean making visual representation equation data set understand better way helping literally see math works math bunch symbol page pretty abstract hard relate graph ing like window abstract world math help us see clearly fact focus lesson today actually look bit like cal led plane plane platform stage graph ing take place understand works first need start close st relative number line remember number line works right number line start zero represent positive move right negative left usually mark showing integer along way imagine number line rotating copy counterclockwise second number line perpendicular first intersect zero number plane basically like version number line second dimension make much useful simple number could show various along line drawing plotting matter many point plot always line number plane plot point anywhere area open whole new world number line plotting point easy one number tell plot point number plane actually need two plot point two cal led rank order work together specify location point number plane fact number plane often refer red plane stage plotting use special format help recognize two put inside parentheses comma separator see comma negative comma comma know dealing understand work remember number plane formed combining two perpendicular number going refer one number axis one axes horizontal like horizon mean axis vertical straight often cal led horizontal vertical axes even often axes refer red variable based horizontal axis cal led x axis vertical axis cal led axis use variable name swell two good first variable flexible horizontal vertical relate specific orientation space may always relevant second reason two actually variable specific position along one two axes plane since variable usually cal led x make sense name two axes way first number listed cal led x second number listed cal led always going list order x first never get confused fact often cal led ordered pair pair always listed order x value value second mean x easy right actually plot ordered pair plane well first number ordered pair tell along x axis point locate dand second number ordered pair tell along axis point two ordered pair work together define single point one give half information point see works let plot locate x value along x axis case instead point draw imagine line perpendicular x axis goes first number ordered pair tell us along x axis point could anywhere along know plot second number temporarily draw line represent every possible point could x value locate value along axis case instead point draw imagine line perpendicular axis goes second number ordered pair tell us along axis point could anywhere along draw line represent every possible point could value ah look v e got first line represent possible location x equal second line represent possible location equal exact point two intersect point entire plane x intersection location point pretty cool huh really good way understand plane works want show even easier intuitive way actually plot intuitive way involve starting point origin plane treating like set simple tell far move point x example plot like start point origin look first number ordered pair see far need move point x direction since x positive move point distance positive x direction since positive move point distance positive direction pretty easy method plotting try times get idea let plot start point origin let tell us far move along x axes since x negative move point distance time negative x direction left since positive move point distance positive direction let plot case x negative starting point move negative x direction negative direction last let plot move point positive x direction negative v e plotted four ordered pair easy way notice point different region place four region cal led quadrant defined two axes quadrant name easily refer conversation need quadrant upper right quadrant contain point x value positive quadrant upper left contain point negative x value positive value quadrant lower left contain point negative x negative value quadrant lower right contain point positive x value negative numeral usually used label four quadrant sand order order would encounter star ted line segment origin rotated line counterclockwise around origin shape cal led unit circle divided four quadrant like plane alright know plane know plot point might wondering got basic algebra well algebra involve many different type equation function lot easier understand graph solution plane know way really get good math practice v e learned exercise watching math antic l l see ya next exactly
