right video going another example basic rational equation going use technique going going write sides fraction cross multiply going turn basic linear equation well able solve one weve got negative x x plus equal x x plus could know straight away try write left side could get x plus case since theres already know right side denominator x plus think going case simply move first term side thing separate minus es separate term going sort pick whole first term move side since negative x x plus going add x x plus sides left side idea negative x x plus five positive x x plus five cancel left negative five left side right side x x plus five extra x x plus five move one notice really get thing separate minus es idea basically stick side change sign front originally negative well positive right side say hey got mean write single fraction take plus one x numerator ill get two x leave denominator alone thing video going cross multiply think negative five negative five one little careful think going distribute thing say going negative five multiply x plus five make sure put parenthesis going distribute negative five right side going back toa familiar linear equation first thing ill distribute negative even divide sides negative divide sides negative end upwith fraction immediately know try avoid fraction possible make arithmetic easier take negative times x ill take negative times positive negative han g right side put x side going going add excuse going sides kind break everything put negative left side take right side thats going positive almost negative trying get x since multiplying simply going divide sides ill get x equal negative usually ask reduce case doesnt weve got check actually solution rational equation cant arithmetic verify fact solution alright hope example make sense help
