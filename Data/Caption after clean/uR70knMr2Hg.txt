hello professor v welcome far seen define set either listing set builder notation state every element set must satisfy also describe several type relation exist set sin lecture describe several operation per formed intersection union sand see relation operation visualize graphically cal led diagram diagram set usually circle type interior circle represent element set exterior represent element member set instance let say two set b drawing set dont two set contain completely different element sin case say two set disjoint disjoint set element common two circle overlap one element common intersect ing area represent element member b collection common element cal led intersection set b denote set intersection symbol look like inverted collection common element form new set example set contain element set b contain element b common intersection form new set contain ing element disjoint set element common intersection form empty set forming intersection two set binary set operation way forming sum two number sis binary numerical operation result set operation another set result numerical operation another set builder notation write definition intersection two set formally intersection set bis set element x x member x member important set operation union union two set element member either b set b element common element member set sare included union example set contain element set b contain element member b union form new set contain ing element even though member set listed write set builder notation write definition union two set formally union set bis set element x x member x member also diagram sin diagram subset typically shown smaller region within instance diagram set subset band set b super set use diagram illustrate relation set studied prealgebra might look like remember diagram although set usually circle illustrate type area diagram show set natural number sis subset set whole subset set rational union set rational number sand set irrational set real far seen various relation well set operation intersection union scan diagram sin next lecture see diagram scan used visualize complex operation
