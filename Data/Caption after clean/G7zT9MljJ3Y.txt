cube perfect symmetry right know mean every face tetrahedron perfect symmetry four face sand theyre ask object turns five people know cube tetrahedron also octahedron eight face know four top four bottom perfectly symmetrical every way twist turn look like cube two dodecahedron thats first might think well many funny arent lots different proved class mean real theorem said therefore five fair dice dice would fair wan ted generate number one eight rolled octahedron face equally likely come somehow intuitively know know thats fair dice eight sides k id hand class said thirty sided die said dont said yeah first meet lumpy roundish thing fact cal led rhombic thirty face face size theyre little cal led rhombic thing die symmetric vertex five face meet vertex vertex three face meet vertex symmetrical example cube three face vertex know every edge two sides theres question fair mean well course know mean practice mean throw know land thirty face thirtieth time let talk second graduate student guy retired executive wan ted test law chance came department said like throwing dice watch television actually might might want participate end wound rolling die three half million recording many times face come thing learn first thing dice roll lot get round course roll times know bounce around give new dice notion long term frequency actually pretty fictional second thing dice way theyre made dice pip filled paint theres six six spot well drill hole lighter six face actually less mass one face opposite know werent fair casino dice much carefully made hole filled paint specific gravity surrounding material really pretty close fair start thinking anything even something silly mean say dice die fair thing think wan ted think say die fair theres notion symmetry group die symmetry object object set make like turning quarter way turning bring atom atom thats cal led symmetry group course one symmetry like turning quarter turn twice go twice right combine symmetry flip way symmetry flip say object form group mean one symmetry take another symmetry compose twice able undo undo whats whats function could perform dice example undo backwards suppose die made jell undo probably wouldnt definition right right exactly atom atom know course reverse different object symmetry tetrahedron less symmetry somehow number different thing less make start fiddling twenty four make die obviously giant thing like know lot different thing could joe kell er defined object fair symmetry group transitive face mean take die leave atom atom face face know right two rhombus well able make ten come symmetry die exactly ten define die fair symmetry transitively face meaning take face face die symmetry group vertices cant take vertex five thing around vertex three thing around could move vertex surrounding territory different prove die transitive symmetry vertex yes face yes face edge either actually show die transitive symmetry thats fair fair fair every face since bet gon na face sit fair idea fair dice found completely fair dice theorem whose group transitive face edge vertices cube course could see every right similarly every edge look guy joe classified fair dice suppose let put point connect point fill solid got five edge sand five triangle going five triangle going thats fair object theyre obviously five triangle sand every triangle could put point wherever want youd get different looking dice right youd get kind little tiny thing long thing thats one parameter family ten sided dice found thirty fair dice classified found us hundred year many member family infinite infinite infinite theres continuous parameter interesting know two continuous list thing list dont parameter found possible fair told could pentagon follow made sense could imagine could hexagon true true say youve caught brad exactly thats exactly correct infinitely many um infinitely many fair dice let amend statement theorem thats infinite family infinite family call dihedral symmetry symmetry dice sides sides sides sides dice dihedral symmetry call interesting dice extra example gave trivial almost well important example took tetrahedron another one stuck together would triangle point point right made one obviously know six sided thing three sides three sides three three fair thing course youd roll youd talk side land another six sided die sense say die less fair die thats philosophical question math question symmetry group die six twist around three thing could turn twist around three thing size symmetry group small could whereas die twenty four know video coin got friend went one two three flip one two three flip talking said well course physics come description fairness someplace course come dice physics mechanics roll die carefully goes around four face blanket well thats fair face could come release die hand actually rolling theres phase space direction going fast fast turning various direction sand actually twelve dimension parameter describe initial condition show twelve dimensional space initial condition partitioned six die leaves hand part phase space comes side one initial condition die comes side two come one six face partition twelve dimensional space six different region partitioning phase space much finer die partitioning crude r way rolling small initial condition difference hand brain make big difference side comes partitioning phase space finer sense symmetry deter mining factor physics symmetry combine allow reasonably satisfactory analysis fair dice cube fairer cube fairer tiny little release make difference side one side two whereas basin attraction side know one six two tetrahedral die crude r would easier control example know coin kind dice kind die two face right obviously head tail symmetric course really flip coin know flip colleague junior high school cal led said gave problem coin coin patterned know head tail head tail head tail head understand went watched flip mind w impy little know would flip course going come head tail head tail know flip make difference roll die make difference end fact next video second part interview professor fair dice casino dice cant wait links screen video description watch right know talking dice fairness like talking wine person wine go forever right let go back know plenty dice video look back catalogue look one coming soon four four four zero zero thats something get excited links screen video description thank much everyone watching video really appreciate
