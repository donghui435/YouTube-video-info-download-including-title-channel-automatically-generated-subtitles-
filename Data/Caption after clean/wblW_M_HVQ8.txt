going define function going define sum positive domain function really positive integer n positive integer try thing going equal plus equal could take going plus plus plus going equal want video prove write function n sum positive integer n equal ton times n plus one way going prove induction proof induction way proof induction first prove base case need prove going first prove base case going induction step essentially saying assume works positive integer k prove going work next positive integer example k reason works let say prove base case going prove doesnt always statement might true everything everything threshold case saying true positive integer sour base case going induction step going prove assume thing true sum k assume going true sum k reason prove positive think positive integer right could keep going going prove going prove formula right expression right case n going prove know true given k true next one know true base case second induction step must true proved generally true k going true k true must true proved true k true k true true true going true keep going forever mean true everything spoken let actually prove induction let take sum let function going sum positive literally going added positive integer prove thing times plus plus divided times formula right expression worked proved base case proven want want assume works number k assume true number k going assume number k function k going equal k times k plus assuming true want think happen try find function k assuming know let try k sum integer k going plus plus plus way k plus k plus sum everything k plus assuming know already assuming already formula assuming going simplify k times k plus assuming know take part add k plus well add k plus find common denominator common denominator going going equal write part magenta first k times k plus plus times k plus thing blue thing thing would cancel id wrote way common denominator going equal common denominator ill write different colour going k times k plus plus times k plus step right factor k plus term divisible k let factor factor k get k plus factor k youd k factor k would colour code would know right k k right going rewrite thing equal thing k plus thats part right times k plus plus clearly thing k interesting proven assume true use assumption get sum positive integer k equal k times k actually showing original formula well would take k put n got exactly result got sho wed proved base case expression worked sum positive integer also works assume works everything kor assume works integer k also works integer k plus done proof induction prove us works positive proven proven works integer work next integer assume worked work already proven works assume works definitely work get checked since assume works assume works works well proven works see induction step like domino cascade go forever works positive integer
