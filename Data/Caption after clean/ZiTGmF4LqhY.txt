want graph cosine graph learn previous lesson way stand right inverse graph afunction reason see draw horizontal line like intercepting graph one point mathematician decided domain look piece cosine graph theyre looking part pi portion see little bit better way draw horizontal line crossing portion graph mean inverse piece function gon na find inverse function switch input output switch x value gon na going locate going interchange x graph point right point key point right pi comma key point pi comma negative going going switch x point going comma pi point switch going tobe comma point remember pi switch pi negative get negative pi well say negative let plot one zero one would rightabout one point five seven way comma zero thats going right theres theres point right point pi zero interchange get zero comma one point five seven thats going one point right let see make make three one point five seven would right point negative one three point one four going go left one right three point one four going right right somewhere graph graph going look something like graph inverse graph notice line equal x line sketch roughly line equal x right see graph actually like mirror image degree line thats graph cosine inverse graph remember graph doesnt keep going goes point point thats looking particular portion cosine graph hope understand better subscribe channel check math tutor ing video math tutor ing look forward helping ill talk soon
