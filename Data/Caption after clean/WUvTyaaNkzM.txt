music hey everyone grant first video series essence calculus ill publish ing following video per day next days goal name suggest really get heart subject one binge watchable set topic thats broad calculus theres lot thing mean mind specifically calculus lot rule formula often derivative formula product rule chain rule implicit differentiation fact integral derivative opposite lot thing like goal come away feeling like could cover core way actually come really mean visual approach joke difference told true actually generating scratch point want think mathematician pondering drawing right feel reasonable could across truth initial video want might stumble calculus thinking deeply one specific bit geometry area circle maybe know pi times radius squared nice way think formula comes well problem leaving open exploring interesting thought come actually lead glimpse three big calculus fact theyre story start circle let say radius trying figure area going lot paper trying different ways chop rearrange piece area many might lead interesting observation maybe tryout idea slicing circle many concentric ring seem promising respect symmetry circle math tendency reward respect let take one inner radius r thats find nice expression area ring like one nice way add might lead understanding full circle area maybe start ring could try thinking exactly new shape area approximate rectangle width rectangle circumference original ring two pi times r right mean thats essentially definition pi thickness well depend finely chopped circle first place kind arbitrary spirit come tobe standard calculus notation let call thickness r tiny difference radius one ring next maybe think something like unwrapped ring thin rectangle area pi times r radius times r little thickness even though perfect smaller r actually going tobe better better approximation area since top bottom sides shape going get closer closer exactly length let move forward approximation keeping back mind slightly wrong going become accurate smaller smaller r slice circle thinner thinner ring sum youve broken area circle area one two pi times radius times r specific value inner radius zero ring three biggest ring whatever thickness choose like notice spacing value correspond thickness r ring difference radius one ring next fact nice way think rectangle area fit side along axis thickness r fit snugly right together height one sitting specific value pi times value thats circumference corresponding ring rectangle approximate picture like two pi r actually get kind tall screen mean times pi times around let axis thats scaled little differently actually rectangle nice way think setup graph two pi r straight line slope two rectangle extend point barely touch es graph approximate rectangle area corresponding ring circle remember approximation pi r times r get less less wrong size r get smaller smaller beautiful meaning looking sum smaller smaller choice r might first think turns problem monstrously large sum mean theres many many rectangle consider decimal precision one going bean absolute nightmare notice aggregate look like area graph portion graph triangle triangle base height thats pi times area times height works exactly pi times squared radius original circle value capital r area comes pi times r squared thats formula area circle doesnt matter typically think math right beautiful argument want think like mathematician dont care finding answer care develop ing tool take moment meditate exactly worked cause way something approximate something precise actually pretty subtle deep calculus problem sum many loo ked like pi r times r value r ranging small number r choice thickness example two important thing note first r factor pi r times also give spacing different value rand secondly smaller choice better could seen different pretty clever way many thin underneath graph graph function pi r considering smaller smaller choice r corresponding better better approximation original problem sum thought aggregate area approach es area graph conclude answer original question full exactly area underneath graph lot hard problem math science broken sum many thing like far car traveled based velocity point time case like might range many different point time one multiply velocity time tiny change time would give corresponding little bit distance traveled little time ill talk detail like later series high level many problem turn equivalent finding area graph much way circle problem happen whenever one whose sum approximate original problem thought many thin like finer finer approximation original problem correspond thinner thinner ring original problem going equivalent finding area graph idea well see detail later series dont worry clear right point mathematician solve problem framing area graph might start thinking find graph si mean lucky circle problem relevant area turned triangle imagine instead something like parabola graph x squared whats area underneath curve say value x x equal well hard think right let reframe question slightly different way well fix left end point place zero let right end point vary able find function ax give area parabola x function ax like cal led integral calculus hold within figure integral like right mystery function us know area graph x squared fixed left point variable right point dont know reason care kind question sake hard many approximate large number small thing scan question certain graph ill tell right finding area integral function genuinely hard whenever come across genuinely hard question math good policy try hard get answer directly since usually end banging head wall instead play around idea particular goal mind spend time building familiarity interplay function graph case x squared function giving area playful spirit something might notice slightly increase x tiny nudge x look resulting change area sliver going call da tiny difference area sliver pretty well approximate rectangle one whose height x whose width x smaller size nudge x actually look like rectangle give us interesting way think ax related tox squared change output little da equal x squared x whatever input times little nudge input change da divided x ratio tiny change tiny change x approximately whatever x point thats approximation get better better smaller smaller x word dont know remains mystery know property mystery function must look two nearby point example change output two difference mystery function evaluate change divided difference case equal value x squared starting case relationship mystery function x squared true input doesnt immediately tell us find ax provide strong clue work theres nothing special graph x squared function defined area graph property da divided slight nudge output divided slight nudge input equal height graph point thats approximation get better better smaller choice stumbling another big idea calculus derivative ratio da divided x cal led derivative technically derivative whatever x get smaller smaller although dive much deeply idea derivative next video loosely speaking measure sensitive function small input see series goes many many ways visualize derivative depending looking think tiny nudge output care derivative help us solve problem little exploration already slight glimpse one way theyre used key question problem require finding area curve gain enough familiarity able look situation like one dont know function know derivative x reverse engineer function must back forth integral derivative derivative function area graph give back function de fining graph scalled fundamental theorem calculus together two integral derivative show sense one inverse high level view peek core emerge calculus follow sin series detail integral point want feel could calculus drew right picture idea right way formula rule could easily pop ped naturally exploration would feel wrong give people sup ported series well deserved thanks financial backing well suggestion gave series see got early access video made theyll continue get early access future essence type series thanks community keep ad new video first month still spend time working video like direct way one thank
