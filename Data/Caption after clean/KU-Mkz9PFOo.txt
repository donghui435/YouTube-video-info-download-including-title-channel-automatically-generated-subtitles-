welcome little tidbit geometry present challenge ill give piece paper picture circle ask find find center circle tool theyll allow pencil mark thing draw thing piece paper another piece paper would well let read answer real challenge actually explaining answer works goes first thing lay piece paper across circle way whoops paper paper degree one point circle two edge intersect circle two position claim mark maddening use side paper actually draw line wish thats really true dotted red line read ammeter repeat trick lay piece paper different position across circle see maybe like still adore mark diameter wear two intersect must true center circle obviously rely classical also geometry course whats prove marking eye degree angle really across bond circle theres really two ways people actually get converse going first actually relevant problem theorem actually result geometry could id ammeter first angle medallion degree great thats correct bet want quick way prove actually situation like draw three radii c x must x degree triangle chase prove x plus must thats irrelevant thats starting diameter proven got degree telling degree sand need prove diameter prove goes present result actually another tactile puzzle draw board two dot imagine nail something board give student piece paper yet built life degree angle ask following take piece paper shove somewhere two tax muck corner paper thing take piece paper shove politely course repeat take piece paper angle position two deck various different position see theres call piece paper seem mark curve look closely people want say right bat curve actually circle question really circle know thats circle thats issue hand given night degree angle first know correspond circle people would say circle theyre going guess center circle two text thats radius r also ready sir challenge prove dotted blue line really circle say point shape property distance mid point also thats need prove improve point dotted curve equidistant two tax mid point two tax must circle prove let draw clean picture given two fixed point deliver radius r radius r weve given curve draw point degree distance also red dotted line well trick take picture right triangle rotate mid point degree make another copy claim red shape really rectangle follow angle x rotated triangle angle matching angle x yonder angle dot also angled odd hundred eighty degree triangle original triangle plus x tell x plus dollar x plus daughter x rectangle know right diagonal rectangle congruent bisect guess would proved previous show episode thats r r diagonal length also bisector must also r r case yes point indeed equidistant mid point fact point circle think said wrong thing point curve mid point curve therefore must circle given flower pot outside hand piece paper know find center flower pot take piece paper lay across night degree touch mark diameter flower point go um run sort problem ill leave challenge suppose come across diggings segment flower get broken rim something circular thats got arc circle full circle arc maybe arc awheel curve jar something question simple simple tool could compute radius circle art came might want apiece paper might want pencil piece chalk might even give rule time actually measure thing would work radius circle ark came thats weve got mark could find locate center circle good challenge thanks much
