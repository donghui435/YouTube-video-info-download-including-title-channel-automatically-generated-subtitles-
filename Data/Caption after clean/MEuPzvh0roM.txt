write following complex number sand little bit complex number number real part imaginary partlet make clear real imaginary going write variable plus real b real complex number part right real part real part number part right imaginary imaginary version special number imaginary unit special number scaled b case may may already familiar know kind wacky thing definition say equal negative didnt took square get negative take squared get negative whats neat imaginary number sis square negative whats useful us solve bunch solve looking real sort implication engineering especially thing like physics rest right really go definition go definition one especially see lot engineering realize value value imaginary going back problem write following complex number right plain vanilla negative look like real number write complex number well write combination real imaginary number could write negative real part plus times times still going negative imaginary part really complex version thing imaginary number theres real part could call real part plus
