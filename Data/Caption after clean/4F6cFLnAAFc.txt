ked simplify r third whole thing squared times square root fourth fifth look kind daunting think step step shouldnt bad first look first expression right taking product second power know instead take term product second power take product going thing r times third let look radical square root thats exact thing raising something power equal times partlet different color part right thing instead writing let write product perfect square non perfect square thing times part times r fourth times fifth let write fifth also product perfect square non perfect squarer fourth obviously perfect square square root r squared let write fifth similar fifth rewrite fourth times fourth times first fifth course raised power let simplify even taking something power power multiply term right simplify r power bit review taking something view either taking finding cube root taking power taking cube root fourth power view taking fourth power finding cube root legitimate ways something raised power r times times sixth power could raise term right power times let color code little bit actually wouldnt need parentheses times times term right times r fourth power times might run colors fourth power raising term power times power theres lot ways go one thing might jump raising power taking square root simplify thats thing taking principal root cant take square root let write square root fourth two ways think times r could say square root r fourth r squared r squared similarly square root fourth also let write square root like see else write term r sixth times times square root times r squared times squared times square root snow couple thing could combine term let write front first let write front first let look two term sixth times squared someone say simplify theres well say sixth times squared thats plus eighth power times interesting might want break depending consider r times r squared r thing r plus could write times r little inconsistent fraction kind left could play around would valid weve already dealt already dealt two already dealt r sand square root times square root sand could merge want wont yet times square root times square root snow theres two ways could might like fractional exponent could break might want take guy merge eighth power know thing let ways wan ted merge exponent could write times eighth times eighth would times even write plus could imagine power thats times r kind mix ing notation decimal notation fraction notation mixed number notation times square root one simplification kind fe west term possible simplification dont want fractional exponent could write ill different color could write debate simplified really could write times eighth instead writing r could write r third times cube root r r could write r third times r thing cube root rand square root two guy raised power could say times square root like one little bit one left really simplified weve merge bases two weve merge r term little bit complicated cube root havent separate would go one someone really wan ted hey sal simplify like
