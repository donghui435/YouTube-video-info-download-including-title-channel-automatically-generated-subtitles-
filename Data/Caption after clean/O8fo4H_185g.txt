video want talk finding slope line finding slope long bad little formula say define slope reason week call slope define change take minus minus intuitively say rise run also abbreviate delta delta x read change change x well case got point comma want find slope could almost count notice would go couple ill abbreviate delta change notice would also go get new thats going delta x could actually count know think could count figure slope say rise many would go well want get height would go rise case would change would run thats much move horizontally well would go would say slope would could also label use slope formula label maybe first point ill call x sub ill call number sub second point hereon right ill call one x sub two one sub two want calculate slope could use formula say stake sub subtract away sub notice top give us thats going give us change likewise take change x could take five subtract away x sub give get like got second ago k bad formula know nice hold maybe one little bit know maybe would little bit harder count thing remember well line increasing move left right remember said line shave positive slope associated certainly positive number k let u h let maybe one ill stay top right quadrant since thats pick maybe nice suppose point comma look like little bit higher let say point dying first point one point comma two point three let pick another point well focus little better let spick another point suppose point comma negative stick little bit higher suppose comma negative k case probably dont want count thing ill call little x ill call second sub x value sub value play connect dot know line going decreasing decreasing know slope work something negative dont get negative number already know done something wrong say slope say subtract doesnt matter label x sub sub could call point x sub sub one x sub sub everything still work get exact slope well take sub one point seven subtract away two point three ill take x sub ill subtract away x sub one point five matter arithmetic one point seven minus two point three actually negative one point five thats three point five technically thats slope usually theyll make slope whole well get rid well multiply top bottom aswell get negative top excuse negative top well get bottom well goes reduce divide well get negative top get positive bottom slope new line negative finding slope obviously show place mathematics want able calculate trouble also need hope make sense post comment video either hopefully nice r cancan answer question
