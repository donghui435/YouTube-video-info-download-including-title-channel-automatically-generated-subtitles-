hi rob welcome math antic sin lesson going learn really important whole branch math cal led algebra first thing need know algebra lot like arithmetic follow rule arithmetic four main operation arithmetic built addition subtraction multiplication division algebra introduce new element element unknown learning arithmetic thing ever unknown answer problem example might problem answer known go ahead arithmetic important thing algebra dont know number yet use symbol symbol usually letter really popular letter choose letter x arithmetic would leave problem like blank wed write answer addition algebra wed write like x x place holder stand number dont know yet basic algebraic equation equation mathematical statement two thing equal equation say thing side equal sign value thing side equal sign case equation telling us known value side equal whats side happen unknown value calling x one main goal algebra figure unknown value equation cal led equation sin equation pretty easy see unknown value actually add together side equation turns x x know x almost seem easy n thats algebra usually given equation complicated form like x exactly equation x quite easy tell x algebra equation lot like game given mixed complicated equation sand job simplify rearrange nice simple equation like x easy tell unknown value going learn lot actually solve equation sin next several let learn important rule symbol cant used algebraic first rule need know symbol letter used different algebra problem stand different unknown example problem letter x used stand number right x could stand different number different problem like someone ask us solve equation x order two sides equation equal x must value problem x symbol stand different value different whats symbol stand different value problem time example equation x x equation say add x x get lot different could add together get like first x stand second x stand x would stand two different value time thing could get really wan ted symbol stand two different time would need use two different symbol like x algebra whenever see symbol repeated equation represent ing unknown value like see really complicated algebraic equation like x repeated lot different times x stand value job figure value iso kay particular equation cant use letter represent two different time way around could use two different letter represent number yes example say equation b could b stand equation true well b equation would true could switch around b equation would also true theres another possibility b also would make equation true right even though b different symbol sand would usually used represent different times might happen represent number oh problem help us understand something important symbol used algebra notice different possible solution equation word b could value depending value b must b must b must cant two different value time value change time value change sin algebra b whats cal led variable value vary change fact equation b value change depending value actually really common algebra refer letter variable since letter stand different value different math antic well usually use word variable talking value change vary problem alright far weve learned algebra lot like arithmetic include unknown value variable solve one really important thing want teach help understand whats going lot algebra problem sand multiplication four basic arithmetic subtraction multiplication algebra usually see division written fraction form like arithmetic four operation status algebra multiplication get special treatment algebra multiplication default operation mean arithmetic operation shown two assume theyre multiplication example instead writing times b leave times symbol write operation shown two know supposed multiply course cant actually multiply figure stand advantage rule multiplication make many algebraic equation less easier write example instead b c could write b c also use shorthand multiplying variable known number like mean thing times x mean thing times since symbol number right next multiplication dont write finally good never write pesky multiplication symbol oh fast case algebra still need use multiplication symbol example want show x get rid times symbol put right next going look like two digit number x whenever need show multiplication two known still use times symbol unless use parentheses instead arent parentheses used show grouping math use show multiplication ah thats good question parentheses used group whenever put two group right next operation guess operation multiplication example see mean group b group could put times symbol group dont default operation algebra multiplication going back problem x wan ted could put inside parentheses like could get rid multiplication sign cant confused number since group right next know need multiply course might seem strange one thing inside group symbol like alternate way could thing would put one parentheses like wont confuse two digit number know multiplication weve learned algebra lot like arithmetic involve unknown value variable need solve learned algebra multiplication sign usually shown default operation assume two thing right next even care algebra good anything real world bunch tricky problem keep student busy school actually algebra useful de scribing modeling thing real world little hard see looking symbol page math book lot easier see start taking algebraic equation graph ing equation like different draw simple curve used describe predict thing real life example theres whole class equation linear equation form straight graph sort equation could help describe slope roof tell long take get somewhere another class algebraic equation cal led quadratic equation scan used design telescope describe ball air predict growth population algebra used time field like science engineering economics computer even though might need algebra get day day life divide sides mean x three two see much butter need still useful part math thanks watching math antic ill see ya next time learn
