hey pressure locker p b c distance p note point p could either inside rectangle could also outside rectangle problem ked interview question micro soft figure give problem try ready keep watching video solution special equation always works rectangle given point pit doesnt matter whether point inside rectangle outside rectangle always true plus c p squared equal b p squared plus p squared sum squared distance p set opposite rectangle equal sum squared distance p set opposite rectangle equation make quick work problem given b p equal c p equal substitute value equation simplify solve p must equal fantastic formula figure distance fourth corner knowing three dont need know whether p inside rectangle outside rectangle dont know anything rectangle like length width still figure distance p fourth corner rectangle rarely taught equation kind interesting name represent geometrically follow p squared represent area thats square c p squared also draw square well draw red equation true total area blue square sis equal total area diagram vague resemblance union jack actually known theorem rarely taught well see actually extension theorem let prove equation well start rectangle well put point p inside rectangle proof similar p outside rectangle well draw distance point p well draw vertical line thats perpendicular c b p well label e f going write variable distance say horizontal distance p equal w horizontal distance b p equal x well say vertical distance top equal vertical distance p equal z rectangle actually label length sin figure know f also equal w c f also equal x get well see four involve p want figure squared distance theorem p squared equal w squared plus squared b p squared equal x squared plus squared c p squared equal x squared plus z squared equal w squared plus z squared add correctly obvious squared plus c p squared equal b p squared plus p squared equal x squared plus squared plus w squared plus z squared thus proven flag theorem figure thanks watching video please subscribe channel make video math game theory catch around decision follow face book go ogle catch social media pressure locker like video please check book links video description
