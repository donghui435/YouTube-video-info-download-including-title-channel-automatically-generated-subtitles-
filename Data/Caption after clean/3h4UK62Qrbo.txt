determine whether following prime composite neither bit review prime number natural number one counting forth exactly two factor example prime factor two natural divisible another way think way get product natural times composite number natural number factor sand well see example neither well see interesting case problem first let think let think guess could think natural whole although also included whole think natural counting actually divide remainder wed consider factor swell clearly divisible fact times equal also divisible times also divisible also divisible times also equal even point dont actually find factor realize prime clearly factor clearly going composite going composite let finish factor ing since star ted also divisible times enough space times also factor clearly one let think nonzero whole divisible times definitely works really arent divisible two factor thats definition prime number prime interesting even prime number might common sense definition even number divisible clearly divisible make even divisible thats make prime anything else thats even going divisible number even going divisible definition going something else going composite prime every even number composite interesting divisible prime technically factor two order prime exactly two one factor order composite two composite neither prime composite finally get divisible divisible divisible exactly two factor prime
