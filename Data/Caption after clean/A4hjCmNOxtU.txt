hi welcome question right two similar triangle right tell us similar right dont worry similar need calculate missing length turns missing length right first setup like proportional fraction let put equal sign right put fraction sign fraction sign know two similar triangle shorter side shorter side theres ratio thats involved two little preference gon na take bigger number goes first gon na put two right bigger triangle side right versus side gon na try figure missing x right missing six hypotenuse hypotenuse two triangle would go together six bigger triangle match x little triangle bigger top smaller bottom math easier six x maybe go algebra think ratio need think go two six well mathematically going two six times three since times three top thing bottom right times get end x turns final answer thanks watching
