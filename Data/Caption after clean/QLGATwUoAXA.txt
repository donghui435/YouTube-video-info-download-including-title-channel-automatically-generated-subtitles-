welcome grade grade geometry class often give tell believe cant prove prove let play nonetheless shove rest found satisfying id like give st us opportunity understand reform come one form volume sphere often volume sphere radius r sphere radius volume pi r cube comes cold exciting id take hard work weve done previous video volume cone show derived formula pi r cube obviously calculus without back hurry go sure much much thought struggle said let enclose top half sphere cone sorry cylinder missing well focus top half theres cylinder radius r obviously height cylinder going way another ways fierce st something remarkable space outside top sphere inside cylinder like larry prince fought previous video let like stack paper remember looking outside part draw attempt particular height x slice height x current cylinder circle radius r whereas slice sphere height would circle small radius mean space outside interested little ring two circle know something area ringing actually calculator said went x inch es could work area green ring notice radius way inner circle still radius r still part sphere mean could work forum radius smaller circle must square root minus x squared still circle radius r thats way r mean area green ring would big circle area big circle minus area small circle radius squared well goes squaring asquare root give back minus x squared pi r squared cancel given pi x squared thought actually fabulous drew cylinder ill draw radius height r drew line diagonal line equal x perfectly diagonal fact sides make cone nurse went x inch es cone well since theres perfect day li also x inch es slice height x also circle radius x also area pi x squared previous video look carol said stack paper height stack piece paper area volume read weve got going weve got space stack screen rim actually area cone space piece like get basically proved area volume space left picture must equal volume cone picture know formula occur ring previous video know area space pi r squared still radius r times height r pi r cube volume space outside theres least top sphere well set thing fallen place id like volume actual sphere well sofar focus top half sphere right say least volume least sphere volume harvest severe would volume whole cylinder minus volume space volume whole cylinder well thats pi r squared base times height minus volume space calculate one third pi r cube well pi r cube minus pi r cube r cube bottom cylinder take away bottom space leaves volume top half sphere great want volume whole sphere fine whole sphere must double pi r cube formula volume radius r thanks
