right video going example related one type parabola form equal times quantity x minus h squared plus k going vertex point positive h sign middle even though negative h use positive age use sign k outside positive h positive going open upwards greater gon na less graph couple graph equal negative x plus squared plus parabola vertex direction open well vertex bad form even though see plus use negative whatever constant thats added actually use one vertex case would negative comma value number front case since value negative certainly less thats going parabola open big deal formula know type form form parabola another question suppose youve got parabola squared minus want know direction parabola open whats vertex whats intercept many real root sare well direction parabola open look coefficient x squared term thats going value case since greater would say upwards open upwards want figure vertex probably question figure vertex gon na parabola x squared plus going going complete square right hand side first thing group x together want coefficient x squared term positive one whatever coefficient factor times x squared would x squared would also change instead would make x give positive gon na leave little room going square step careful first thing take coefficient front x positive going give us positive take number square thats going give positive thats number putback inside parentheses point weve change equation around distribute everything would get three x squared originally problem would get plus twelve x originally problem notice multiply coefficient three value four got would getting positive twelve really done added twelve equation right hand side kind nowhere compensate since added twelve going going sides know tome kind step know little less mechanical really think whats going make sure getting coefficient point though idea factor x squared plus x plus times x plus simply write x plus squared negative minus negative vertex form notice picked vertex case vertex would negative comma negative weve figured vertex writing vertex form part c whats intercept well get intercept get intercept simply plug x equal zero plug x equal zero original equation well get three times zero squared plus twelve times zero minus one well simply get value negative one intercept going equal negative one could say point zero comma negative one last question many without finding root going make geometric observation said vertex negative two comma negative negative comma negative dont know somewhere said parabola coefficient x squared term positive said since positive going open upwards since open mean case going cross x axis since two place would say well since happen two x axis twice two real root one quick problem suppose want find equation parabola given know equal two well know formula parabola times x minus h quantity squared plus k well case h value positive one thats vertex k value negative one thats value vertex point given everything need told equal two would x minus vertex one use plus could write plus negative one gon na write well negative one weve got equation parabola
