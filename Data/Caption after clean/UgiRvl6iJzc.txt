abstract artist want create two proportional triangular painting one painting shown thats top one right long two missing sides second painting two proportional triangular painting one way think gon na similar actually know based triangle marked angle angle two arc right measure angle right angle measure angle right angle let new color one arc measure angle right corresponding angle measure corresponding angle sare congruent know similar triangle thing tell similar know two triangle similar mean ratio corresponding sides going tobe let look corresponding sides let figure ratio use ratio figure sides right first thing look side thats opposite blue angle one arc angle side x thats going correspond side thats opposite blue angle b corresponding sides could also view side orange magenta side orange magenta likewise side right thats opposite origin go opposite orange double arc angle going correspond side thats opposite orange double could view side thats magenta blue angle finally let use side opposite magenta angle opposite magenta angle blue orange angle going correspond side opposite magenta angle blue tell us ratio know since similar ratio corresponding sides going ratio two ratio length side b length side x going equal ratio length side b c length z going equal ratio c c x z tell us length tell us b equal tell us equal tell us b c equal z one going solve also tell us c equal right one want use magenta c equal also solve x c actually get know triple equality actually create two one unknown solve unknown first five halves equal z equal z solve z bunch ways could could let see multiply z times sides could multiply z times sides e times sides actually wont swell like come multiply sides let one step time get z z times five halves times five halves equal equal multiply sides times reciprocal five halves multiply sides isolate z right cancel left hand side left z right hand side left turn thing write mixed number goes three remainder thing point soy z going point weve done one sides figure x z know five half know five halves going equal x z going equal x z multiply theres multiple ways could could flip sides equation could say ill doit slightly different way way theres multiple ways solve could say equal x z taking reciprocal sides multiply sides equation multiply sides left x z equal times divided going x z end done smaller painting dimension
