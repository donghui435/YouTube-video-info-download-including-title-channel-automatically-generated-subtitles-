say example root x minus graph want find inverse graph first thing want find inverse islet go ahead state domain range graph domain right case domain going tobe x greater equal range value vertical component going tobe greater equal find inverse equation switch x solve new happen term domain range domain range also interchange domain associated ax range associated switch x domain range also switching domain range new function k domain going tobe instead range becomes domain x greater equal range would yis greater equal go ahead pay attention go find inverse going switch x x equal square root minus want solve right going square sides get x squared equal minus dim going add side thats x squared plus equal going flip weve get equal x squared plus going put little comment reim going state domain x greater equal graph entire graph parabola span going going like k parabola notice find inverse graph looking reflection graph line equal x see interested piece k thats reflected want portion right thats part x greater equal branch portion thats thats notour inverse graph want piece right thats important way finding inverse switch x solve keep mind domain range switch domain inverse function range used original function see interchange hope understand work function better subscribe channel check math tube channel tutor ing look forward helping future video ill talk soon
