let see construct angle let initial arm angle beer compass point b choose convenient width maybe little half length draw point b r point change width compass take compass point make first say arc intersect point get terminal arm need join point b get r aba terminal arm angle formed angle degree construction really simple made arc without width compass kept made arc intersect ing previous one got
