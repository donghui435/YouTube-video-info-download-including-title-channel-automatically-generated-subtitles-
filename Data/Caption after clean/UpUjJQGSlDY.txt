hello r finished talking exponential function graph ing lead us naturally logarithm si would like calculator handy log find button calculator equal two logarithm book say form logarithm equal base b x x greater zero b greater zero x b must positive log equal write log standard base ten log base equal always use example start logarithm one head might recognize go k squared equal see equivalent equation written two form one written log form exponential form simple example use time classes show going logarithm sit nothing take logarithm get look form comfortable got exponent base log ended base exponent form log base squared equal base looking equation exponential form want go log form exponential form base log base exponent logging exponential form answer log base equivalent equation squared form exponential form keep mind going erase write like write help go back forth log exponential form log base answer get logarithm exponent let use pattern please write base subscript dont write main line going make look like lot multiplication may writing log base going look like log confuse teacher use go back forth exponential form log form see evaluate basic log equal log base true statement getting logarithm going convert log form may familiar exponential form well log form go exponential form base answer exponent base log going base exponent get logarithm keep chanting get logarithm taking log exponential form actually answer equal log base becomes fourth equal take look another example negative equal actually true true true exponential see log function remember base negative exponent get rid negative exponent flip one third third power equal write log form log base exponent base exponent base logarithm answer answer exponential form going taking log going log base get logarithm get exponent negative might put back log equal squared equal might icing log function undoing hundred apply common log get take squared get back something start something get make exponent get back exponential form logarithm inverse math operation sit like addition subtraction multiplication division times said addition subtraction time equal divided get back multiplication division inverse get back addition subtraction inverse function sa couple expression going log form exponential exponential form log take look try evaluate log base might go well tried checked back book work calculator log base calculator log base common log log base e cal led natural log tal ked natural log yet equal dont know like put extra part textbook give question ask evaluate write whole equation see base answer going exponent write log function exponential form going x equal first logarithmic section textbook going giving problem head without aid calculator four power equal think four third equal another x equal wrote bases exponent something lot solve equation involve equation dont need logarithm take look question log base equal toi dont know know textbook give log function probably going able base calculator wont able inspire calculator wont let write log function exponential form base answer get logarithm exponent x power equal write base move top numerator like left hand side allow negative exponent yes log base equal negative exponent allow become negative onehow log base textbook might said base log equal base logging always going cancel would equal let explain equal say read book know log base going fill expression base answer exponent convert logarithm exponential form get logarithm exponent base exponent base answer converting log form exponential form seven x equal seven well exponent seven x equal seven must mean x equal would x equal second power would mean x would equal problem written natural log yet let see least one natural log e fifth equal r havent even tal ked idea l n explain natural log l n log base e going take natural log e see like bases starting stack might know going happen like pi pi approximately equal approximately equal one run well indefinitely number show electrical engineering nature compound growth dont want derive comes standard numerical value natural log log base e see bases might think cancel would right going write log form exponential form see base exponent answer answer well look simple equation sides equal base sides exponent must x equal see enough times say oh bases match let drop say x equal let see squeeze another example minute alarm goes raised log base need write common log textbook may say cancel dont need write going leave say equal let figure say dont know expression equal snow equation exponential form log form let write logarithm form log base exponent answer getting expression answer x exponent well exponent log base see getting exponent answer exponential form look log base function base x must equal textbook show base log base touching cancel bases yes x equal r thank watching go homework
