hi come another math video help boost score math class improve understanding hopefully make learning math lot less stressful going talk video whats difference decay factor decay rate growth factor growth rate get right video working math class right wondering know whats difference different term well probably working formula equal minus r power basically formula something growing exponentially decay ing exponentially p starting amount thats whatever beginning amount like hundred percent original amount rebeginning increasing something going going rate r something going subtract ing rate going decreasing time usually year could month days know r thats rate thats growth rate decay rate problem say growing per want take percentage point zero five want convert decimal five percent know two point zero five thing decay ing know gon na want also convert decimal show example ill show problem play say example car say car thirty say every year lose value rate per year percent want convert decimal moving decimal point two left thats point two zero decreasing gon na point two zero simplify see going point eight zero starting want find much car worth say five year simplify see base less one going decreasing exponential decay function gon na going like gon na approaching zero classic car say example classic car twenty thousand dollar say example going value ten percent every classic car thats ten percent point one zero simplify see one zero see base greater going continually multiplying one point one zero going increasing increasing going exponential growth function going going continue last thing want mention aside know decay rate growth rate concept decay factor growth factor mean parentheses thats factor thats whole entire group look one zero thats growth factor know growth greater one point eight zero see thats less one know thats decay factor somebody problem like say rate decay thinking whats percentage either one giving problem like youd say well see thats zero convert point zero percentage twenty percent thats decay rate rate know percentage plus minus rate whole quantity parentheses thats growth factor decay factor hopefully question may regarding topic go ahead subscribe channel check past video sand look forward seeing future ill talk soon
