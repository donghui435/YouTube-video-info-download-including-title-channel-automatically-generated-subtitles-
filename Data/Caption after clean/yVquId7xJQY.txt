welcome video law point probably know solve right triangle going solve triangle right triangle one use solve triangle right law sine sand wrote equation law top right hand screen say sine angle divided length side equal sine angle b divided length side b also equal sine angle c divided length side c drew picture left little easier see drew angle upper case letter sand drew drew length sides lower case letter let stake look angle right notice opposite side angle side true angle opposite side corresponding letter thing angle b notice opposite side angle b opposite side angle c side c point trying make opposite side angle corresponding let get star ted right away example example let say angle right degree sand let say side thats opposite angle well say side length let say side length eight going solve entire triangle let label triangle start work well say angle right angle angle side opposite angle beside mean side length side say angle b mean side opposite b side b know side length eight equal side b last least theres one angle left angle c side opposite c bottom side going side call right basically triangle law going bunch plugging angle degree also know length side length um part formula already given us right let plug everything part formula sine angle sine divided length know length divided equal sine b dont know angle b yet got ta leave blank divided length side b know length side b equal divide right equation easily solve angle b want get b first thing going going multiply sides equation notice right hand side eight cancel left hand side sine divided equal sine b right let scroll little bit little bit right point going plug everything calculator multiply times sine divide plug calculator get desk really long decimal going round four get intermediate probably round four decimal point equal sine angle b right still havent gotten b thats trying trying solve angle b still sign front um order get rid sign opposite inverse sine right angle b equal inverse sine plug calculator get b equal inverse sine round one decimal point get forty eight point seven degree inverse sine forty eight point seven degree know angle b let plug triangle know angle b equal forty eight point seven degree right going clear space give space work right let solve next part triangle notice two angle triangle salt salt four know three triangle equal know angle plus angle b forty eight point seven degree plus angle c dont know yet equal degree sum triangle equal solve angle c quite easily add degree forty eight point seven degree get hundred eighteen point seven c equal want solve c want get rid one point seven subtract one eighteen point seven left hand side cancel get c equal minus one hundred eighteen point seven equal sixty one point know angle c put diagram angle c equal sixty one point going stuff theres room work right theres one piece triangle dont know yet length side c going solve length side c right know sine angle c angle c sixty one point three degree divided length side c dont know yet thats equal sine sine know angle length side know length side equal right need solve c going get denominator first going multiply sides c left hand side c cancel thing left sine sixty one point three equal sine divided ten c going scroll little bit get little bit space c need get c going get rid ten sine multiply ten going divide sine whatever right hand side left hand side also multiply divide sine right notice right hand side cancel sine cancel left hand side left divided sine sine equal right hand side thing left c right hand side right order solve c need plug left hand side calculator take divide sine multiply sine get rounded one decimal point equal c know length side c equal nine point three goback diagram know c equal nine point three triangle completely know angle equal degree know angle b equal forty eight point seven degree know c equal point know side length length know b ha sa length eight know side c length nine point three hope video video law stay tuned see next video
