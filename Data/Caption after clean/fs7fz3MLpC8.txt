determine whether statement always sometimes never true explain statement b squared plus b minus b plus equal b minus real b well one thing jump even manipulate algebraically think b value left expression wont equal b minus b value make left expression becomes undefined denominator becomes way denominator going become b negative let write b equal negative b squared plus b minus b plus become equal b squared would minus minus would undefined equal let write way equal b minus negative minus put negative left hand side doesnt evaluate negative evaluate undefined already found example b true definitely always going true found case let algebraically manipulate see true pretty much number let see maybe factor numerator b squared plus b minus think two take product negative add get thats going positive negative numerator rewrite b plus b minus denominator b plus leave like work left hand side assume b equal negative b plus divided b plus well long expression thing b minus assume b equal negative assume b equal negative thing indeed equal b minus true real except negative sometimes true true every time except case b equal negative even try number squared plus minus get negative plus indeed equal negative works works work number b equal negative
