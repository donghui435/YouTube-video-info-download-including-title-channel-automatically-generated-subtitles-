g day welcome tech mouth channel going look video work amount combination possible select number object part series video swell looking combination first thing combination differ order doesnt matter example five different book ill write going select three going select three book going take holiday ill show book greeny sort color book got dark green sort got black book got blue book red book five book going select three take away doesnt matter order grab bed going chuck suitcase order doesnt matter go working many different ways could well first thing ill show three book one two three might realize select first book got five different first one go got five book choose one two three four five going put select first book say red one leaves four book choose second space like check maybe book leaves three different book third space need workout number different ways get book different going permutation ill show extend multiply three five times four times three equal sixty theres different ways done showing us moment saying pretty much red chosen blue green would considered different blue red know book order permutation would include sort thing would say well han g theyre different order answer weve got need one extra step order work thing choose thats fairly logical think looking three space might say well many different ways ordered many different ways three ordered said might remember video three space choose two one many different ways three ordered three different space set written quite often factorial times different ways defy tell number combination opposed number permutation divided equal going show rule actually write pretend truth actually dont use rule much rule handy one wear work order get bit understanding thats way work combination first rule want sort show go example say looking thing going select way write follow n object different wire thing equal one equal well selected three going write little bit weirdly times times times help us work rule actually left first going notice didnt tie end fact didnt take times part part ill put little show didnt take rule could written n factorial factorial number times oh factorial times times times factorial times n factorial n take away factorial n take away factorial one little extra thing divided number number k times times factorial divide might look say k factorial divided take away factorial divided factorial also divided factorial thats rule use dont particularly use tend draw like r working well go couple instance committee four people four going select bigger committee four people selected many different ways could dont particularly care order going many different combination possible might get used might write combination might say people theyre going select position equal going position position sok first one tend choose people taken nine people choose position sake leaves us people put position theres three people leaves people going end multiplying n factorial n take factorial part going divide remember different space factorial times times going fill going get answer rule want count left times also say well going buy get times times answer different ways one last one question one many different ways select people going select play many different ways might give go right would first going five different going filled people thats sort explanation different spot going times times times start put little multiplication actually right times leaves us bottom going really mean much equal thats way work combination pretty pretty easy um anyway hopefully get idea fact going write go going write factorial rule ill quickly like jot would call think call factorial n minus r um know take away factorial factorial right pretty simple right anyway hopefully video great help ill see next time bye
