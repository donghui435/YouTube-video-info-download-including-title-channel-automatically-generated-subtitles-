right four sided figure quadrilateral two parallel definition trapezoid want given given us area trapezoid let think would get long times height get multiply times would area rectangle wide high would give us area figure like let pink color area figure loo ked like would times would give us entire area right trapezoid clearly less let go thought experiment would happen went times wed finding area rectangle width height could imagine rectangle right rectangle right thats times rectangle look like area trapezoid two exactly halfway look area difference let color area difference left hand side area difference right hand side focus trapezoid start yellow smaller rectangle reclaim half area half difference smaller rectangle one left hand side get exactly half left hand side get half difference smaller right hand completely make sense area trapezoid entire area right really average exactly halfway smaller rectangle rectangle let take average two going times plus times think area trapezoid look two bases long base short base multiply times height could take average could also think thing plus factor ing plus times thing writing different ways different ways think plus times could view average smaller rectangle multiply bases times height take average could view well let add two multiply times height divide could say hey let take average two base length multiply give another interesting way think take average two length plus would width look let width would look something like width would look something like multiplying times height well would rectangle like exactly halfway small large rectangle equivalent statement snow let actually calculate could times plus could also plus times divided plus divided times way area trapezoid square
