video going learn find volume cylinder specifically volume cylinder formula comes well start going back cylinder happen circle previous year youve learned area circle pir squared pi r squared actually come let look strip away formula begin one r see circle thats radius multiply second r r times r square covering area r times r whatever radius times also show r squared like see screen also note one r squared cover entire circle let add another r squared us total two times r squared see cover little half circle thats going let add third r squared mix see covering circle little bit still see circle circle covered let toss r squared weve covered entire circle notice large square covering circle plus additional space r squared actually area big cal led area circle actually area square little bit bigger need little bit taking r squared need eliminate area r subtract two value r squared minus r squared end upwith times r squared ultimately pi r squared later another video well talk times r squared comes going goback base cylinder circle know find area circle ultimately area circle essentially represent volume cylinder height obviously volume going anything times picture height one unit see volume cylinder simply area circle pir squared times increase height pi r squared pi r squared times finally sub height wed like simply variable h volume cylinder formula actually area base pi r squared area circle simply multiply tall cylinder end volume pi r squared times h volume cylinder
