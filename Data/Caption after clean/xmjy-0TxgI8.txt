ked graph f x equal natural log ill use calculator find table different x value f x equal ill hand draw graph might little bit ill graphic calculator come wont use graph ing function graph well part hand let draw little table x value value sand see get x value let say whatever output going set equal dependent variable plot vertical axis call dependent variable let try really small actually first let remind whats domain whats set valid input x put right natural logarithm base logarithm defined input case greater zero cant even take logarithm zero raise something negative exponent negative bilio n power get pretty close zero never get zero take positive base exponent raise toto get zero get negative number input logarithm function case natural logarithm function greater zero thats greater zero divide sides mean x greater zero essentially constraint domain real greater zero let try something pretty close zero see happen behaviour approach close zero especially input less one let try let try dont know let try dont actually want get far cause want able see resolution let try let try input well try thats good enough let draw axes well plot domain positive x dont really draw much negative x negative value let give room work x value go use let see value f x going equal get take natural log remember times x natural log take natural log times obviously get get negative ill say negative input get let get calculator back going take natural log times ill write clear times thats natural log one able head power raise positive base get one well raise e zero power get one ill write able one head snow let next one happen natural log times obviously going te natural log us make sense less less e e forth let try natural log times log get us ill round finally natural log times times x x get going natural log going ill choose new color going term run low high let call right would extend axis little bit x axis f x axis let call right positive positive would half way cause look like gon na able see well first point thats one tenth thats gon na right around gon na sit right point fair enough thats first point right let x fair enough x equal might right little bit closer close little bit closer let put right would point x f x x f x take us right point think see curve finally point well last one yellow x little bit closer gon na right gon na connect dot sand ill white get x value closer closer graph function gon na get negative gon na get closer closer axis without ever touching gon na get less close axis slowly break away curve like curve like keep going like happen pretty cool x get smaller smaller function becomes negative x x never power raise e positive base toto actually get zero raise raise large negative exponent raise e negative one billion get number thats close e one bilio nth power number thats close never going approach zero make number get smaller smaller never quite approach never logarithm zero approach done graph natural log typical shape cause logarithm shape logarithmic graph
