hello welcome linear algebra tutor going study something cal led also matrix arithmetic mostly matrix addition going talk want introduce topic early simple concept usually student read mean big fancy word dont understand know like within class take whether statistics calculus linear algebra definition simple thing sometimes get way let tackle one let talk get though let recall algebra geometry geometry know youve worked x know plot x comma right instance ordered pair cal led right two ordered pair comma know mean x equal yis equal comma serve separate two know theyre separate one goes x goes know pretty basic stuff leading something three dimensional space x z right point would comma comma negative know number goes x goes number negative z three dimensional system go find point three dimensional space know three right three going set see given two example two going generalize say n however many separate comma right right pool word put put next question rest mean ordered list ordered list make total sense simple understand even though first term seem complicated mean ordered reason theres n front frequently linear algebra gon na talking sometimes well pair case ann two equal n almost like right three strung together dealing three dimensional
