welcome brownie video question arose perhaps quite tricky question notice property theres special point need center rectangle line straight line point guarantee chop rectangle two part equal area question arose shape property well answer property regular octagon property dip question figure common feature question clear suppose polygon property exist special point p someone interior straight line point chop polygon equal area matter line drawn say polygon must regular kind must even number sides odd number say say sides property must possess thats research question good way ask video going little bit work going take going realize serious math geometry answer question three second give away answer see want pause play time right goes um yellow polygon drawn tell looking trick problem guy yes theres certainly line goes point p two sides fact ill call opposite sides size hit call opposite line side side claim polygon property line p chop part equal area line better parallel line picture moreover line better length line congruent congruent claim property opposite sides grunt parallel namely square regular even gon z regular octagon regular hexagon regular pentagon wont better dont even clear opposite sides right prove going prove polygon property area chopping property must opposite sides congress parallel let geta picture going ill draw two sides polygon drawn parallel assuming yet going left going right polygon indeed special point p point p interior going use fact chop air two part equal two part equal area line p told left area whoops let meet n equal right area right thats going true point line peace let draw another one make thin line go area left thin line equal air left right thin line well little bit thought show two area triangle paint yellow must equal area triangle knowing equal area bet thats enough prove top bottom edge opposite edge line must parallel goes strange way going take little bit first let get pen going right first notice vertical angle two angle equal side b let see side length actually write formula area triangle half product two sides times sine angle right theres advanced math right area yellow triangle half b sine angle dot area bottom triangle half angle dot area right know times b c times like ratio b c ratio right thats little feature want use right unfortunately thats quite helpful stand gon na something little weird draw yet another line going p goes whoops make sure touch es token area pink triangle area air triangle fact area whole pink yellow top air theyll fingernail bottom fact linecut whole area polygon half let label edge call e whoops need pen sorry e f right trick triangle e angle angle f bet could prove e f also particular easily fand ratio namely triangle triangle sides coming ratio vertical angle top principle geometry proven two pink triangle actually similar fact improve two yellow triangle similar whole picture summer pet proved theyre basically similar triangle everywhere want think picture great similar triangle mean angle match particular maybe want go angle angle got one line another line think transversal property across transversal theres alternate interior angle congruent mean opposite sides must fact parallel alright property thats special point p line opposite sides must opposite sides must parallel right little point mean cant actually kink going kind line peer hit side instead going token proved side must parallel side well well cant bent line thats parallel parallel basically always hit go around corner theres really sense true opposite go little bit picture awfully messy maybe doesnt quite make sense get going goes weve proven pink triangle area similar area scales kiss scale factor squared try similar scale factor k area k squared area area two pink triangle tell scale factor k squared one actually two similar congress scale factor scale factor one proven point p actually line going gosh mess mess mess let draw pair opposite sides proven parallel special point p proven line pair going dessert must give parallel line sand weve proven two trying similar scale factor mean length equal length length equal length point spear actually going mid point think gotten weve proven line peer goes must still stay line vice line end goes p must end theyll either around corner going triangle congruent length equal length polygon property exist point p line two part equal area must property well defined opposite sides parallel congruent ah theres little bit work converse suppose give shape opposite sides parallel need special property actually hard prove let give quick idea shape congruent parallel claim theres special point p works find point connect claim sec thats special point pand bet go go prove everything working right right interesting question stuck polygon polygon property cut half property sized con parallel curved sides know circle property thats good circle draw good circle little drool certainly special point p line center circle cut two part equal area fact get quite funky circle need shape pul led circle apart drew line line claim shape property cutting half property make wonder real research question tell whole class curved edge style area cutting half property get weird thing work thing sort straight edge edge boundary point boundary edge non circular part curvature constant pull property trying research question shape half whats ultimate answer ultimate question real research territory fun
