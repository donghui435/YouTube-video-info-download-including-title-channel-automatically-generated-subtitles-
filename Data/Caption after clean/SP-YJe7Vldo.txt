voice overmost mathematical study ing real include thing like zero one zero point three pi could keep listing real familiar explore something interesting explore notion number squared would get negative defined thing squared got negative one defined thing iso defined whole new class could really view imaginary unit imaginary would negative pi times e times might raise another interesting question combined imaginary real difference real imaginary example let say say call z z tend used variable talking talk complex say z equal equal real number five plus imaginary number three times iso thing right real number plus imaginary number might temp ted add two cant wont make sense kind going different well think visually second cant simplify cant add real number imaginary number like let make clear thats real imaginary imaginary number like call complex complex number real part imaginary part sometimes see notation like someone say whats real part whats real part complex number z well would five right might say well whats imaginary part whats imaginary part complex number z typically way function defined really want know multiple imaginary part right herein case going going three visualize visualize two c artesian plane real horizontal vertical axis plot complex number sis vertical axis plot imaginary part thats imaginary horizontal axis plot real part plot real part like plot real part example z right five plus three real part five would two three four five thats five right imaginary part three one two three complex complex plane would visualize number right right would visualize z complex plane five positive five real direction positive three imaginary direction could plot complex say complex number equal let say negative two plus would plot well real part negative two negative two imaginary part going could imagine plus one iso go one going right right complex number complex number would point complex complex let write point complex plane let one say complex number b going say let say four minus three would plot well one two three let see minus one two three negative three get us right right would complex number b
