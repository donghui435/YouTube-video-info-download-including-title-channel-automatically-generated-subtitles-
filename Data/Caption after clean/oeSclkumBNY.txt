math class something multiplying right ratio equal ratio thats proportion way would solve would multiply diagonal equal product diagonal example setup would times equal b times c basically thats id cross multiplying across equal sign want make note learned cross multiplying another name way cal led mean basically property tell us guess could think middle product mean equal product extreme outside example would like say example want find geometric mean put variable x mean position position gon na cross multiply solve x thats geometric mean x times x x squared times take square root sides see x coming thats geometric mean another example would like say example let see one idea weve got mean mean extreme going put interested working going cross multiply see thats going tobe x squared equal times take square root sides see x coming might thinking well simple way exactly right take together let say two cal led b see cross multiplying end getting x squared right product two well say thats b getting together square root sides see x equal square root times b right want quick way multiply two take square root thats geometric mean learning geometric mean drop altitude end getting three similar triangle sand theres something cal led leg geometric mean theorem altitude geometric mean theorem ill links want check otherwise wrap subscribe channel check math tube math tutor ing look forward helping future video ill talk soon
