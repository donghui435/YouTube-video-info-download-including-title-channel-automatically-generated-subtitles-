video going find inverse matrix let say matrix inside matrix b c formula inverse matrix going equal determinant matrix symbol like absolute value mean determinant matrix another matrix matrix notice red diagonal notice original matrix top left position bottom right position original matrix bottom right position inverse top left position red diagonal switch place take green diagonal notice green diagonal c b actually stay position original matrix however inverse sign switch original matrix positive notice inverse theyre negative use formula find inverse matrix matrix b first thing want find determinant matrix b order find determinant matrix thing need multiply red diagonal multiply green diagonal subtract thats going right determinant matrix b equal first thing need multiply diagonal notice anda going multiply times need subtract multiply green diagonal notice green diagonal times going multiply times determinant matrix b equal times sick times minus equal know formula inverse equal determinant inverse matrix b going equal determinant matrix band know determinant matrix b equal going replace determinant symbol number thing need fill inside matrix take look red diagonal need switch position original matrix b diagonal notice top left corner inverse going bottom right corner notice bottom right corner original matrix b inverse going let take look actually stay position inverse original matrix b going keep position however switch sides since theyre positive original matrix theyre going negative inverse matrix taken inverse matrix b however scalar need simplify matrix little bit inverse matrix b equal times times negative times negative times positive final answer found inverse matrix b
