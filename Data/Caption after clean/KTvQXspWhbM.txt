right video going example remainder theorem basically remainder theorem say youve got polynomial f x dividing linear factor look like x minus say long division synthetic division find remainder say going tobe thing youd plugged original function even going see squeeze three first one notice weve got minus squared plus x minus f x thats case dividing x minus say number thats going tobe value whatever say function f x equal cube minus plus x minus want find remainder divide x minus say plug times cube minus times squared plus minus let see cube squared times negative positive negative let see times would would minus minus would would say remainder case long division would simply value let maybe one one one real quick well third example separate video notice weve got cube plus squared plus dividing x plus notice could write denominator x minus negative kind plugging like first example saw negative button plug positive see positive actually going plug negative function numerator function top part let f x negative cube plus squared plus say plug negative well well get times negative cube plus times negative squared plus times negative plus let see negative cube times negative negative times another negative plus let see another positive remainder case oh heck let last one doesnt look terrible notice weve got x sixth plus excuse x plus fifth plus minus squared plus divided x plus could write x minus negative thats going value plugging simply plugging function f x going write f negative say would get plus times negative v nine times negative one cube minus four times negative one squared plus take negative even power negative one even power positive one raise odd power negative one well get negative four minus nine turn positive one times negative negative four plus ten see negative negative negative eight negative negative would negative seven plus another one getting negative six arithmetic correct look like last example long division well simply get remainder negative six arithmetic
