squared minus plus one divided x plus three going set weve got x plus three going x squared minus plus want want see like many times x go x squared think working backwards could say times x x squared want try match first term subtract want eliminate first term thats going x going going distribute x times x x squared x times want want subtract teach lot theyll change opposite subtraction opposite see cancel get negative say times x negative could say many times x going negative whats negative divided x well thats going negative going distribute negative term give us negative minus going change science opposite add comes see zero th degree constant first degree x first lower degree remainder final answer going x minus remainder divisor take remainder final answer see x plus didnt go evenly remainder take remainder divisor like showing long division problem long time ago k let stake look another example dividing long polynomial process gon na see many times go cube thats going x squared k notice lining squared keep going distribute give us cube squared going change opposite add thats really like subtract ing get squared plus plus many times go negative six x squared thats going distribute term negative plus going change science opposite add give us plus trying see many times go little thats three halves going distribute get three x minus three halves change sign opposite add thats going give really like halves plus constant degree two x thats remainder going remainder dividing divisor thats right quotient another way saying answer many times went polynomial thats polynomial long division ill see next video
