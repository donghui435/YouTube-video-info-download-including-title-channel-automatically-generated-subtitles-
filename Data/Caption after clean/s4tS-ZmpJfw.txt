let draw isosceles triangle triangle two sides equal seen previous video vertical axis symmetry part side see two part match exactly thats say shape symmetrical cal led reflection symmetry cal led see take one part keep mirror get original shape reflection one part complete shape wait kind symmetry another kind know answer another figure figure made six square want tell shape reflection symmetry draw line two part formed match exactly try different realize line drawn shape reflection symmetry shape rotational symmetry yes rotational symmetry mean name try rotating figure center point rotating center point example triangle rotated center point rotate like rotate point rotate like rotated one vertices rotate like shape rotate differently depending point around rotated let come back figure rotate figure completely around center point see many times look exactly like original one rotating rotating counter right count number times rotated figure look like start figure rest zero rotating degree get shape original counter still let rotate original shape degree sand see look exactly like original shape perfectly see increment one counter continue rotating till finish one complete rotation rotating degree give us shape rotating degree give us original shape back counter two two tell tell us figure rotated completely rotated image look exactly like original image twice degree another say shape rotational symmetry order two recap say shape rotational long want listen carefully shape rotational symmetry look exactly like original number times rotated center point number times look like original say shape rotational symmetry order easy find order rotational symmetry let give shape sand dont try finding order rotational symmetry first oval look like next square equilateral triangle circle rotational symmetry need find order begin oval shape start rotating see many times rotated image look like original saw look like original shape two times complete rotation order rotational symmetry two similar way dont try finding order rotational symmetry three start rotating square cent degree order rotational symmetry square equilateral degree degree sand times one complete rotation order three come circle think answer matter rotate circle always match original shape rotational symmetry order infinity remember shape rotational symmetry look exactly like original number times rotated center point degree
