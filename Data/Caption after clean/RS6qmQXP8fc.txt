today going talking unit circle reason talk super important topic one concept could pick remember trigonometry would need calculus would unit circle use often better unit memory easier calculus going reason looking angle unit circle time today going talk unit circle going use calculus comes building unit circle interested three thing first interested image unit circle right hand side want label one place circle well talk second also interested angle interested radian degree going say angle radian want label also want able label angle angle going indifferent colors keep track less going label unit circle build unit circle order going first angle angle degree comes building along unit circle first thing want remember unit circle cal led unit circle reason reason radius equal one unit talking point unit circle centered origin point point unit circle always centered origin radius circle r equal thats distance origin point distance r equal radius equal thats cal led unit circle one unit since know since cal led unit circle know going distance one along x axis right since centered origin x axis right going distance one along x axis positive direction x axis point right weve gone distance along x axis still value point similarly could label point negative radius left hand side circle want label point along axis point x value point negative cal led major axes x axis axis label little bit tricky actually derive musing angle associated going right give way way remember going label point going big parentheses going say give us two fraction denominator equal thing thing like really common way remember unit circle going going write like x going along last step take square root numerator take square root one right square root still leave square root cant simplify write square root cant simplify square root square root square root square root associated right associated value point first quadrant really easy find point three quadrant change sign example move quadrant x value going negative negative x territory value going positive say point going negative root three two borrowing point directly across negative positive going negative x negative root positive root going negative x value negative positive value root like move quadrant going positive negative value label borrowing directly first quadrant positive x value root negative value positive becomes negative point positive root x value negative root value point positive x equal negative root value last quadrant going value negative x value negative value negative going get negative root negative going get negative root negative going get negative negative root going unit circle want look angle radian well way star ted point along axis positive direction going start point angle radian talking angle radiance angle going always start angle positive direction x axis move counterclockwise around circle like positive radiant angle going occur counterclockwise direction going move way going realize go full circle know angle going two pi get way back beginning angle two pi going tobe zero two pi right course entire circle pi half circle right going pi saya quarter circle working backwards half circle pi quarter circle going half pi word pi want angle along negative direction axis know pi plus another quarter circle know quarter circle pi pi plus pi end pi make sense start zero count half pi quarter circle get pi pi pi pi pi pi count pi quarter circle look pi term pi split quarter pie get half angle right pi half pi pi count start pi pi right pi pi pi pi pi like getting finally pi pi last need know angle pi pi actually angle pi notice line angle pi angle fact way toward pi area double area right remember thats pi course take pi multiply get equal pi thats know pi also find pi know angle angle pi see notice distance right distance distance notice theyre equal distance equal pi angle pi could always take pi divide thats course equal pi times equal pi thats another way know pi count pi line going pi pi simplify pi course pi pi course pi pi cant simplify way pi pi get pi pi pi pi pi pi pi way pi pi course pi weve marked radian let go ahead look angle degree said angle also going go around circle one full time remember one full turn degree zero way going attack way went radian going half say angle going take half say angle going go halfway going get course make sense start zero add degree sat time get cut half angle half angle right start zero count get zero right seven pi four back get us back know first angle one third degree angle ninety divided three give us know thats also say also give us say start zero count zero add add get add get back angle degree thats build unit circle memory important calculus well going use unit circle million different thing common way well use unit circle something like cosine pi evaluate come problem calculus well need figure value cosine pi well unit circle point represent cosine sine angle point point theyre actually cosine theta sine theta mean value represent cosine angle value represent sine angle look first angle pi six cosine pi six find pi six since cosine take x value point cosine pi would root sine pi would tell us find pi six angle take value point sine pi would way cosine pi find angle pi since cosine take x value equal use unit circle simplify different example sine pi find angle pi look pi looking sine angle take value since sine thats positive thats equal root simplify way well tangent pi need express trigonometric function term sine cosine know tangent equal sine cosine get sine pi divided cosine pi grab value unit circle sine pi go angle take value since sign get root cosine pi go angle take x value since cosine negative root see cancel well negative tangent pi negative thing note unit circle also use find greater two pi radian angle go zero way around two pi given example cosine count around right cosine going get one pi right find one pi go start zero pi pi back pi end back angle pi ending cosine look x value x value negative equal also way angle thats greater pi subtract pi angle always get right answer minus pi pi cosine course thats know equal negative either count around like pi pi subtract pi angle angle thats less pi last thing want mention weve positive angle counterclockwise direction positive angle move counterclockwise get positive pi positive pi positive pi actually going encounter lot well especially parametric polar curve calculus going opposite direction example ked find sine negative pi like instead moving positive direction pi going move negative direction pi radian normally would start would move counterclockwise positive direction angle pi point right get pi well going move negative direction distance going come hereto corresponding point negative pi see negative pi equal pi sine negative pi thing sine pi four either way taking sine angle look see equal negative root two two point negative angle start zero instead move clockwise negative direction distance would move positive direction find positive version angle
