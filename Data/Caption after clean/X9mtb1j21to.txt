welcome let discuss triple whole turn sides right triangle example many people memorize triangle hundred one side form side dimension simple right triangle squared plus squared relationship thats true right triangle check indeed triple set property whole say anda squared plus b squared equal actually hard find another example triple five squared plus squared squared people head believe seven squared plus squared squared one favorite plus squared squared large squared squared soon coming well talking thousand year b c listed thing eventually generating actually wrote formula come triple sense proved formula complete elementary following sense many elementary school sitting back classroom great big multiplication table going use multiplication table triple need pick two square like square appear diagonal choose ill choose example beginning square right second row column fifth row column let look two side ill make little square array square array circled multiplication table going add two square plus subtract minus going add two side plus claim squared squared fact thats triple like said one let another two square say time nine one companion sides three three theres array multiplication table add two square plus subtract add two side claim squared plus squared ill dude yet another one let crazy one let choose choose right add times subtract tec ware add corresponding side case plus squared squared working factor fun lots fun work well really clear digit little abstract let erase square number go get rid guy let get rid guy saying general choose square number maybe squared n squared let see theres squared plus n squared let difference case would squared minus n squared b sum two side number sin case got going pretend really going well n throw column throw column going n times n plus another n times n claim ing number squared plus number squared number squared little exercise algebra goes squared plus b going squared minus n squared plus n squared fourth plus n fourth plus cross term minus squared n squared plus squared n squared well fourth plus n fourth minus squared squared plus square plus squared actually squared plus n squared squared c squared bingo trick two subtract ing second side indeed give triple course question every triple appear way well let look example discover famous three four five triple coming manner three four five well five sum two square yes four one difference one three yep thats check ing look side two two four yes three four five appear manner appear manner summer two square yes nine whoops missing nine one difference nine one different yep side would appear manner choosing basic example example manner sum square plus plus square number doesnt appear matter well b c year ago actually prove triple appear way basic model mule basic three four five fundamental example guy two everything double everything triangle number triangle triangle amongst term thats primitive example thats every primitive example proved guarantee appear method multiple triple primitive example might appear thats basic one definitely sure challenge try prove claim little bit tricky work believe volume one thinking mathematics series go try get good deep number theory way right thanks much
