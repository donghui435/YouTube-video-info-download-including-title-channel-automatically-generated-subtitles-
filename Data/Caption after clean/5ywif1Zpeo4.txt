remember planar graph graph drawn plane without edge crossing plane graph example drawing plane dont edge crossing let draw example plane graph also four region call next want take look many region already four region example seven vertices four region may notice take number vertices minus number edge plus number region get two let try another example green plane graph seven vertices eight edge three region notice number vertices minus number edge plus region equal two coincidence actually hold connected plane graph theorem want prove g connected plane graph n vertices edge region n minus plus r equal actually known formula plane graph lot different mathematics remember actually area mathematics known graph theory weve seen theorem works two example want try figure prove general proof use induction number edge case equal connected plane graph mean graph must isolated vertex mean n equal know region well minus plus equal base case done next make inductive hypothesis suppose theorem true connected plane graph something bigger equal next need use inductive hypothesis show theorem hold connected plane graph edge start let ting g connected plane graph edge let say n vertices region proof two whether graph g tree remember graph connected cyclic mean connected cycle want review tree check description video tree first case consider case g tree well tell us equal n minus proof found previous video check links description know number edge also notice exactly one region thats draw cycle mean region closed region exterior unbounded region case n minus plus r equal n minus n minus plus get g tree done know work next look case g tree know g connected graph g connected tree g must definition cycle c well let e edge cycle c aim remove edge e apply inductive hypothesis smaller graph g without e need careful one thing though remove edge e need make sure dont disconnect graph inductive hypothesis works connected plane graph think e removing e disconnect connected graph e would scalled bridge edge weve seen video bridge edge edge bridge lie son cycle however e clearly cycle took belong cycle c tell us e bridge edge therefore graph without edge e still connected course still planar well n vertices minus edge r minus see let take look small example plane graph case highlight particular cycle call c next ill highlight edge cycle call e clearly see edge going disconnect graph also course graph stays planar notice course youve removed edge number goes number vertices stays look number region removing edge example one region general removing edge cycle plane graph decrease number thus inductive hypothesis theorem hold graph g without e remember g without e connected plane graph edge know number vertices number number region must equal thats inductive hypothesis simplify see thatn minus plus r equal therefore principle mathematical induction theorem hold value bigger equal zero thus know connected plane graph n vertices edge satisfy equation n minus plus r equal two proof done put square know connected plane graph equation well disconnected plane graph theorem actually generalize comes corollary g plane graph c g connected number vertices minus edge plus number equal plus number connected component let take small example ill draw notice ill start label see region snow number vertices number edge region course number connected component together see n minus plus r equal clearly plus theorem generalize disconnected case well formula often tal ked context ill draw polyhedron happen tetrahedron five vertices eight edge sand five face well write v e f number vertices edge also draw graph like bird eye view tetrahedron thats associated graph polyhedron notice five vertices eight edge five region notice picture bottom region exterior unbounded region plane graph general v e f vertices edge face polyhedron v minus e plus f equal two known polyhedron formula actually pretty famous formula know comes click related video stay tuned new video graph theory topic ill see
