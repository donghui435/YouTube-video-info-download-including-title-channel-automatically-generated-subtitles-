want take look particular transformation cal led reciprocal transformation given graph function equal f x graph equal f x look like figure want simple example let use graph equal minus x graph equal minus x first thing want graph minus x thats pretty easy alright gon na line intercept slope gon na go right away two point fora line graph line immediately thats line get point graph well take example point reciprocal reciprocal graph pass point point reciprocal gon na reciprocal grapple pass point let pick nice integer gon na reciprocal reciprocal kind see whats gon na happen graph goes infinity reciprocal goes get kind happen passe notice value line getting close well let take table got x minus x minus x let let x get closer closer see happen get close point weve already done x equal let half reciprocal going could plot point would half reciprocal might able tell already get closer going get closer going infinity thats graph going get close graph going move infinity right mean asymptote x equal let draw vertical line line graph going get closer closer move happen side plot plot point like line x value gon na negative reciprocal negative negative reciprocal graph actually go point value negative reciprocal thats negative well go point well let say halves reciprocal see gon na geta similar graph similar kind graph x approach es right going negative check really quickly point point negative reciprocal thats negative x point half minus minus reciprocal thats negative yeah see goes approaching right approaching going negative infinity graph actually go straight negative infinity weve got vertical asymptote might also recognize x axis horizontal asymptote right graph getting closer closer x goes infinity x goes negative infinity purple graph graph reciprocal function equal minus x red graph graph original line equal x
