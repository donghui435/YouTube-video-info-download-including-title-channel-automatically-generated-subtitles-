pure mathematics math produced fascinating pattern attractor tables mathematics used many heat flow turbulence theres one problem however leaves mathematician utterly involve simple arithmetic follow definitely impossible problem starting positive whole number n let produce new number according following rule n even divide odd multiply add example let start even divide get odd multiply add get going produce pattern forever well hard whats problem try starting like eventually reach one challenge show matter starting number choose always reach one problem drive mathematician crazy dont seem clear special power collapse quickly take step get however start take step reach number graph point start show erratic nature graph reach es peak course used computer help click box enter starting number explore date starting less checked eventually reach one course doesnt prove conjecture starting mean working hand good idea impossible problem usually cal led problem also known conjecture name problem back mathematician intrigue lecture conjecture also came known problem problem problem interest problem part conspiracy slow mathematical research us getting back problem could happen starting number doesnt reach cycle approach es cycle advanced theory show cycle besides must least possibility would get arbitrarily large approach infinity scenario highly unlikely time mathematician built complex try understand problem made little progress even century genius pau l said challenge mathematics yet ready hey dont let pau l discourage see problem
