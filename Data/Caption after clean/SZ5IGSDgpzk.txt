orthocenter point three altitude triangle meet instead finding three altitude mean find altitude altitude line perpendicular base opposite vertex sou sing base going find line perpendicular opposite vertex point opposite vertex point reference going compass make hit twice find two point change compass make x drawing line opposite vertex x first altitude perpendicular find another altitude ill use segment side triangle base opening compass opposite vertex base twice change compass link compass light intersection x lining upwith opposite vertex draw altitude also perpendicular base two altitude meet orthocenter
