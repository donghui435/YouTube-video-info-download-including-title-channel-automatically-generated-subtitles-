ked parallel parallel slope theyre different never ever intersect need look different exact slope lucky us equal x plus b slope intercept form really look figure slope slope line equal see right therefor line b slope equal two guy parallel ill graph second see finally line c ill purple slope equal dont know purple dark line c line slope theyre different different theyre going parallel see let actually graph line intercept negative point slope move positive x direction go positive x go x going go going go going see line line going look something like best draw straight possible line better version line going look like well thats good drew line let line b line b intercept negative negative intercept slope x goes go x goes goes x goes going go line going look something like trying best connect dot sit steeper slope see x blue line increase direction line b notice intersect theres definitely two parallel line sand finally let look line c intercept point slope increase x direction going goup direction decrease going godown direction increase well going go point going bunch point sand graph line let one time decrease two going go right negative negative still slope one time get right see line line look like look like notice line c line never intersect exact slope different slope theyre increasing exact rate theyre never going intersect line line c parallel
