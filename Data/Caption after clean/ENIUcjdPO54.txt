ked rationalize simplify rationalize part right mean get rid square root denominator really want get rid somehow wont simple multiplying numerator denominator principle square root x would multiply principle square root x times would get rid radical would negative one times principal square root x would still stick around denominator way rationalize something like binomial radical denominator two x fancy word say conjugate denominator square root x minus want multiply denominator square root x plus ill show second course anything multiply denominator also multiply numerator otherwise value expression going multiplying whole thing key want point going work make sense multiply fancy word conjugate conjugate show mainly trying like get imaginary outside denominator case want get rid radical well try get dont worry dont know mean thats conjugate show fancy word mean plus b conjugate plus b minus b literally sign right good multiply expression like times conjugate end getting difference plus b times minus b weve seen multiple times thing equal toa squared minus b squared distributive property twice see everything comes squared minus b squared right problem need rationalize simplify let let multiply first since thats easy x times entire expression distribute x x times principle square root x thats x times right multiply x times plus x thats numerator denominator minus b times plus b one way view thats going squared think way think think one b minus b plus b going squared minus b squared multiply going difference square squared square root x squared thats going give x going give going x square minus well whats one squared well could say done might let see anything could anything could simplify well could factor x x well x times square root x plus clear simplify thats thats thats right could write guess one thing could write could write x times square root x could write since thats x first power times x one half power could write x three halves power clear thats actually simplification good least point view
