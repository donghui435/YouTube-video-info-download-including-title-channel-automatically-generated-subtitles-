geometric mean geometric mean two value extreme sare two value theres something cal led mean probably know cross multiplication product going going solve altitude one hypotenuse drop altitude hypotenuse right triangle split hypotenuse two part b happen hand three similar triangle sa small one medium one right triangle similar one another corresponding angle congruent corresponding sides going proportional happen proportion setup triangle triangle triangle really compare ill show real quick take triangle rotate take triangle rotate orientation direction youve got altitude youve got v altitude see set proportion altitude altitude b base base height height two triangle similar corresponding sides practicality practically speaking use well look want find altitude x set proportion say x x thats geometric mean thats guy mean cross multiply get x squared equal take square root sides get x thats going one thing right triangle drop altitude hypotenuse base altitude split hypotenuse two piece axon know three triangle formed similar set proportion thing access see altitude mean extreme cross multiply get x equal divided get last example sometimes people theyll give whole length taking minus see let verify works see equal see altitude geometric mean two part hypotenuse
