ecologist survey age tree sin local forest plot map data shown range tree age median age tree forest first let make sure understand plot even really way seeing spread different data point age tree sand also give information like median age tree sit whisker part could see black part whisker box another whisker right tell us essentially spread data say lo west data point sample assuming axis year sand say highest tree right want range think range statistics point view thinking highest data point minus lo west data point going minus range thats tell tell us everything fall year year snow box box start well let explain way line right median half age going less median see right median plot tell half age tree less half older right median median less real less main median middle age less middle age greater older actually splitting data four would call first quartile ill call first quartile maybe ill first quartile roughly fourth tree way calculate sometimes tree end one point another fourth tree send fourth tree fourth look like fourth quartile call first quartile second quartile third quartile fourth quartile answer question already range theres spread median age tree forest even though might tree old median forest actually closer lower end entire spectrum gesso view median central tendency measurement year sand even see closer left box closer end left whisker end right whisker
