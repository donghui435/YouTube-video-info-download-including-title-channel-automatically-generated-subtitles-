video gon na one example graph ing parabola gon na graph negative three x squared plus x plus one one thing notice going negative three thats coefficient x squared tell parabola going open downward already know vertex remember find vertex either square formula negative b f negative b thats going use case remember b coefficient x well get negative negative thats going tobe positive thats going going vertex plug back formula get well negative times squared plus plus negative going negative see could make multiply bottom would give multiply top bottom write negative plus going positive excuse negative positive plus getting vertex already mean know little bit try make fairly decent little little parabola little x let make positive one well put positive one one sixth big pretty small number thirteen twelve thats little bit bigger let put vertex right always good kind label thing ill say thats one six thirteen twelve know since thing opening downward gon na x intercept definitely going hit x axis find intercept remember find intercept take formula plug x well get f zero get negative three plus plus say get value positive know graph goes point zero comma next thin gim gon na simply find remember substitute value zero equivalently f zero solve left weve got negative plus x plus play dont think gon na factor nicely gon na use quadratic formula x equal negative b give us negative plus minus square root b squared times negative times c positive take value going negative weve got clean little bit weve got negative top plus minus square root squared negative gon na positive going give us denominator negative weve got two plus root negative negative minus root negative think going kind better intuition little bit kind figure theyre sitting know theyre sitting x axis used little calculator square root going tobe roughly equal got use little bit arithmetic let see negative plus negative one approximation negative minus left negative one sorry theyre definitely divided negative six negative one plus three point six point six negative six one negative one minus three point six negative point negative six let see two point six divided negative roughly equal negative point four three thats actually exactly second value four point six divided six going positive getting value roughly equal two point seven six two soon es little smaller one negative one zero least know little bit better point let see one little bit smaller one let little bit smaller one one let stick negative one graph well one would somewhere roughly inside gon na label though exactly would point positive one would negative one plus square root negative six point know exactly would negative one minus square root thirteen negative six got enough kind place connect dot well nice little graph think kind got useful information know vertex know exactly found intercept think thing thats enough provide pretty reasonable graph parabola
