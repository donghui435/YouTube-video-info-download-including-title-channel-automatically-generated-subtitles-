welcome video law previous video solve triangle law thats probably first method use solve triangle however theres particular case cant solve triangle law need use law cosine explain need touse law cosine one case need use law cosine give us two sides let say give side cand also give us angle two sides notice b two sides given us um type triangle thats given youthen need use law solve triangle one case use lot cosine sis given three sides triangle given angle sand given sides triangle particular case also use law solve triangle brief introduction let get away example right say given triangle know bottom side triangle equal let say another side triangle know distance let say know angle two sides let say know angle degree right like given two sides know angle two sides degree particular case given two sides angle know need use law right let label triangle let say angle angle say angle angle b well say angle angle c know side opposite side know side length nine side know since top angle c know side thats opposite c bottom side tobe side c side length side c know side thats opposite angle b equal side b dont know length side yet right weve triangle ready plug everything law cosine formula wrote formula right hand side screen formula exactly use one want based triangle way label triangle missing side b going use formula b side thats trying solve trying b going use b formula everybody triangle differently dont label exact way possible could use one three formula right let plug everything formula know going use second formula right form say b squared equal squared know equal instead squared going put plus c squared know c squared equal instead c squared going put minus times know equal times c know c equal coast sine angle b know angle b equal degree put cosine degree weve plugged everything inlet try simplify little know b squared equal squared plus times times cosine plug calculator going equal hundred thirty eight point eight four one rounded four decimal point intermediate step always round four decimal point right even b squared equal plus equal point eight four subtract minus eight four one know b squared equal point one nine know value b squared need find value b need find length b know b squared quite easy find b b going equal square root b squared b equal square root point one five seven nine need plug calculator square root point one five seven nine equal nine point three rounded decimal point always round final answer two one decimal point know b distance nine point three going solve rest triangle save little bit time dont need use law cosine finish triangle would take lot lot extra time could actually use law bit quick er havent seen law video make link bottom right hand part screen hope extra question leave comment see next video
