whats special area equilateral triangle get need understand sides equilateral triangle equal angle sides equal equal assume angle x degree three x would degree sum angle triangle always degree angle measure degree question get area look equilateral triangle sides drop perpendicular vertex onto opposite side divide two equal part length length aswell concept hold strue even isosceles triangle drop perpendicular side two length equal equal two triangle two equal drop perpendicular vertex joining two equal sides opposite side opposite side divided two equal part move area equilateral triangle look equilateral triangle sides perpendicular side two equal part let height h look figure closely need find area equilateral triangle term side need find area think know area written one half base times height base already term snow manage get height h life become easier get c h look right triangle instance used get h term let say squared equal h squared plus squared square hypotenuse equal sum square two get h root h term basic formula area triangle one half base times height half base height root three two times get area equilateral triangle root three four times squared thats formula find area equilateral triangle need length one sides substitute get area course know derivation case forget area know derive quickly also remember two sides equal perpendicular drop third side two equal part
