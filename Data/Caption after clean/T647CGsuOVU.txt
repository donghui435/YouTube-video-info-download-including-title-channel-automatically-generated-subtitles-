imaginary real part say given function f x graph function get nice parabola let say want figure equation equal want find root son plot function see parabola actually never according plot solution equation theres small problem little year ago smart guy name gauss proved every polynomial equation degree exactly n root sour polynomial highest power degree two two root sand gauss discovery random rule today call fundamental theorem algebra plot seem disagree something important cal led fundamental theorem algebra might problem telling us two perfectly good value x could plug function get zero could missing root short answer dont enough typically think exist ing dimensional continuum number friend fraction even irrational like root show system incomplete missing left right live whole new dimension algebraically new everything problem mathematically considered impossible two thousand square root negative one include missing dimension analysis parabola get way interesting input full two dimensional form see function really behave sand see function exactly two looking wrong dimension extra dimension possess common knowledge part reason given terrible terrible name suggest arent ever fact gauss something say naming convention yes missing dimension comprised given ridiculous name imaginary gauss propose instead given name let let lateral mean imaginary get better handle imaginary mean lateral number sand really understand whats going spend little time thinking human really use natural make sense used early human number line would series civilization advanced people answer sophisticated math question plant seed show divide land keep track financial natural cutting innovate dand new high tech solution filled gap number line basically cutting edge technology couple thousand next big innovation hit number line number zero negative took time get everyone board since obvious mean fit real world zero negative met skepticism largely voided culture suspicious largely people vie wed connection mathematics reality ancient history would intentionally move term around avoid negative show zero negative eventually fade partially negative useful concept like debt mostly negative kept sneaking turns whole lot math allow negative play without negative simple algebra problem like x answer negative accepted problem would solution like thought original problem solution thing crazy weird think problem like solution word algebra problem basically say thing take away many thing left surprising people lived planet would suspicious question like problem make much sense even brilliant mathematician century really know negative one point wrote negative greater infinity fair say negative imaginary raise lot good valid require student understand work elude mind thousand even come accept negative imaginary first place really seem connected anything real world extra help explain missing solution problem next time l l begin address going way back discovery imaginary
