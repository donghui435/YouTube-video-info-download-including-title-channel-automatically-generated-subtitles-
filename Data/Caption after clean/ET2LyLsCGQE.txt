going begin unit volume well talk volume need start new word move three dimensional first word polyhedron polyhedron solid form polygon single region space right drawn pyramid pyramid like square pyramid polygon polygon sare square triangle polygon would considered face polyhedron pau l excuse face meet would edge three edge meet would vertex like two dimensional vertices thing need talk polyhedron way weve polygon number sides number face classification word excuse tetrahedron penta hexahedron heptahedron set two drew octahedron course tetrahedron penta five face hexa six seven eight case yes telling many face thats word dont exactly tell shape penta face well could let say pentagon could know base pyramid penta drew right phases right phases trike triangular pyramid triangle let give triangular pyramid together draw dont well see triangular triangular pyramid hexahedron could cube could also pentagonal pyramid yes could pentagon base six right descriptive polygon let get little bit specific indeed face polyhedron regular polygon face congruent face meet vertex exactly way polyhedron cal led regular polyhedron like regular polygon every angle every side regular polyhedron every face meet way thats kind important mark gon na try draw cup course thank like curator thats regular polyhedron six face octahedron eight face every face equilateral triangle excuse regular equilateral triangle theres force also let say red one twelve face see goes twelve nice sides thats make done thats twelve face thats another one face see zoom little bit one every face equilateral triangle meet way may think meet way around room goback room ceiling theyre actually pyramid come kind would meet way convex country concave know meet cal led let talk special prism polyhedron two congruent face parallelogram one pentagonal prism two face match course two face pentagon one thats one hi ding likely flavor like mist still done fate remain ing face work parallelogram dont marked give little credit thats could good also drawn one similar little bit different parallelogram look like consider parallelogram gimp may little rectangle one would look like rectangle one look like parallelogram kind acute angle one also prism two congruent pentagon still parallel well saying well huh difference well one connect ing right angle scalled right prison mark right angle acute angle well mean right angle side prism cal led oblique prism prism made lateral edge perpendicular base two polygon congruent right prism lateral indeed perpendicular draw mark right angle whether going polygon outside pocket k excuse right also said prism made polygon also make volume also familiar something cylinder best definition found surface rotating parallel line segment around fixed line rotation weve kind done two dimensional object two around axis axis rotate line segment kind think rotating around would make cylinder make cylinder right angle take axis put diagonal way one would oblique cylinder mark right angle would know right angle height altitude cylinder run right axis altitude one actually going outside cylinder altitude one base base running straight theres altitude one would run thats axis one going outside defined regular cylinder know supposed talking volume sure hear know volume take volume like know area penny thats volume word volume cylinder area behind oftentimes v equal capital p times h capital b excuse capital p area base works poly excuse works cylinder anything two congruent bases use going start volume prism cylinder area base one try draw square pyramid would edge edge vertex vertex face triangle triangular face base square base bottom would hexagonal yes hexagonal prism two hexagon parallel meet parallelogram many many face doesnt one two six make eight would make octahedron yes triangular pyramid tetrahedron didnt draw cube another right triangular prism yes even though equilateral still polyhedron day need find volume exact answer right triangular prism edge length sa right cylinder race height know second go regular hexagonal prism every edge eight ten edge ten inch es rectangle notice marked right also number four oblique cylinder radius four inch es lateral inch inch es bounce dude right good luck see tomorrow
