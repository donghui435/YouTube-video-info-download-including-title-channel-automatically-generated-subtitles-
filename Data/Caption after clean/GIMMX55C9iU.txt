right video want basic question related finding quadrant angle fall quadrant angle lie suppose little x axis little axis theres absolutely thing one way label quadrant top right quadrant x positive also positive thats quadrant quadrant kind top left corner quadrant going bottom left corner quadrant going bottom right quadrant dont know every time always seen written people always numeral dont know quadrant make look smart use numeral k thing need remember well two thing one right go around go way around right weve gone distance weve rotated degree convention measure angle positive x axis angle positive go counterclockwise angle negative go clockwise k way around weve gone well youve gone half way around thats going hundred eighty degree well half going ninety right little right ninety degree degree going get back would either degree kind dont move say thats zero degree notice go way around though angle degree something else thats important know many different angle put kind exact place let couple couple basic following angle third quadrant weve got degree negative degree zero degree equivalently go way around top bottom positive angle first angle degree well certainly degree degree angle would know somewhere first quadrant thats quite right well see degree well degree weve gone half way around know hundred eighty degree would go another go degree somewhere would make angle certainly thats going us third quadrant quadrant one two three certainly look like sore answer let look negative might well discuss well since negative angle instead going counterclockwise go clockwise negative would put kind little bit fourth quadrant would angle negative thats certainly quadrant four correct either said first one quadrant quadrant three last angle said quadrant four kind switching numeral right big deal one following angle second quadrant negative degree let see let talk negative one first said zero degree go counterclockwise going positive go opposite way thats going equivalently said degree equivalently thats angle negative degree going clockwise well negative degree going somewhere would angle negative degree quadrant four one snot right degree well let see said go way way around youve turned degree well didnt quite go degree went little bit less look like angle degree would also fourth quadrant would correct positive degree said eat top one way describe angle positive degree go halfway around hey thats fall degree going somewhere going somewhere second quadrant look like thats going answer choice case common stuff know finding quadrant lie got able time certainly one want able get belt
