today going taking look quadratic formula right another way solve quadratic equation whenever factor ing doesnt work square doesnt work method work quadratic formula able help solve equation alright quadratic equation x squared plus b x plus c equal b coefficient c constant plug formula quadratic formula formula need memorize negative b plus minus square root b squared minus b c equation trying solve first example got squared plus equal trying solve equation right first thing going going go going identify right b c negative minus end right going directly go formula going plug value need start negative b b negative plus minus little sign right middle going b squared b squared minus times c c negative square root thats allover times whatever right rest way matter thing negative going stay right front right going leave plus minus underneath radical right minus going multiply times times negative going give negative multiply thats underneath radical denominator going four e alright simplify ing underneath radical depending handle negative integer usually plus plus simplify negative minus square root allover right right need recognize something plus minus oka yat point right expression give two answer right answer plus minus sign right give us plus minus sign right going going break expression two different answer first first one ill negative going choose plus square root thats going first answer second answer would negative going choose minus sine square root right square root going turn decimal head point probably put entire thing calculator come pay attention around whatever round two check make sure right depending good calculator complicated might need put parentheses around numerator calculator know calculate entire value four thing one right depending calculator might need put set parentheses let work x put calculator done correctly x going approximately point going know go forever ever ever one x approximately equal going get great big long decimal like probably book might say around theres round nearest hundredth one rounding nearest hundredth would approximately equal point x approximately equal point negative going two answer generally time take look second example thats maybe straightforward first one k one weve x squared plus equal negative right exactly matching quadratic formula quadratic equation alright going need move term left want x squared term first x term second constant last sides equation move going choose middle going subtract sides x squared minus plus equal oki might well right away first step know want order variable theres going tobe imaginary one b going negative c k plugging everything quadratic formula making sure dont make mistake working alright one b negative formula say negative b negative thats formula going go first going replace really got negative negative outside plus minus b squared would negative squared minus times times c underneath radical going multiply two times case one alright simplify ing negative times negative positive ill five right plus minus negative squared give positive minus times times radical two times one bottom going little bit going one plus minus square root right square root let go one step plus minus right point give us give two answer right point use plus minus sign thats middle break get would plus even say x equal x equal x plus divided thats going give x minus one thats going give divided made two one x equal alright one got square root knew could square root one didnt even need use calculator k time need go calculator couple decimal place root turns number head alright pretty much going worked like least beginning algebra one class original equation ax squared plus c form want make sure rearrange term move everything left youve got equation set equal zero solve quadratic formula
