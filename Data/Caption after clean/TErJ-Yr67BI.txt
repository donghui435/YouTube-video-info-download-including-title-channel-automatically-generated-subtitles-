parallelogram right want prove first thing think arent intersect ing parallel also view transversal sand focus b right see intersect c band since know theyre parallel parallelogram know alternate interior angle must congruent angle must equal angle let make label call middle point e know angle must congruent angle alternate interior angle transversal line snow look diagonal c call transversal c make argument intersect two parallel alternate interior angle must congruent angle de c must let write must congruent angle bae exact reason something interesting look top triangle bottom triangle one set corresponding angle congruent side thats going congruent actually let write explicitly know proved previous video parallelogram opposite sides parallel also congruent know previous video side equal let go back saying two set corresponding congruent side thats congruent another set corresponding angle congruent know triangle congruent triangle know triangle going go blue orange last one triangle congruent triangle blue orange last one c de congruency know two triangle congruent corresponding corresponding congruent know side e c correspond side ea could say side ae correspond side ce theyre corresponding sides congruent measure length must ae must equal ce let put two slash es since already used one slash exact logic know de let focus know must equal de theyre corresponding sides two congruent triangle must length corresponding sides congruent equal weve done proof weve shown look diagonal b splitting two segment equal length vice splitting b two segment equal length bisect ing let go way prove two diagonal quadrilateral bisect ing dealing parallelogram let see going assume two diagonal assuming equal right equal given want prove parallelogram remind angle going equal angle one first thing learned vertical let write let label point angle ce going equal congruent angle show us two triangle sare congruent corresponding sides congruent angle another know triangle ill keep yellow triangle ae bis congruent triangle de c congruency congruent enough know two triangle congruent know corresponding sides angle sare congruent example know angle going congruent angle bae corresponding angle congruent triangle sand transversal two could parallel alternate interior angle see two kind candidate alternate interior angle sand congruent b must parallel ill draw one parallel c alternate interior parallel writing shorthand forgive cryptic nature saying exact weve shown two sides parallel could exact logic show two sides parallel wont necessarily write exact proof show two first know angle congruent angle right actually let write know angle ae c congruent angle vertical angle sand reason well see triangle ae c must congruent triangle deb triangle ae c must congruent triangle deb congruency know corresponding angle must congruent example angle must congruent angle theyre corresponding congruent let new color must congruent transversal alternate interior angle congruent two transversal parallel must parallel c must parallel alternate interior angle sand done weve proven diagonal bisect start given end point say hey opposite sides quadrilateral must parallel parallelogram
