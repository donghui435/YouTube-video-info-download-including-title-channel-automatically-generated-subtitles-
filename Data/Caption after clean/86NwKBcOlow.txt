create graph linear equation plus equal line essentially set x satisfy relationship right hereto make thing simpler going set table going put bunch x value figure corresponding value based relationship make little bit simple rim going solve becomes easier solve given x plus equal want solve let get rid left hand let subtract sides equation left hand side guy cancel get equal right hand side minus divide sides equation divide sides left hand side right hand side could leave way actually would pretty straightforward way leave could call divided minus minus times x let come bunch x value see corresponding value plot let new let slightly different shade x value corresponding value going ill start well could start anywhere ill start x equal keep thing pretty simple x equal minus equal times minus give us point comma x x going right middle go right thats point comma another pointlet say x going pick multiple get nice clean answer x equal minus times denominator cancel outwith numerator minus tell us point x equal equal line equal right equal go like thats point drawing line actually need two ruler kind straight edge could connect two point sand neatly every point line satisfy relationship right get practice ill let let say x equal equal minus times equal times equal right divide denominator get numerator get thing becomes times minus point comma line x dont move comma could keep going could try could like plenty two would enough draw line let draw ill line look something like could keep going graph linear equation let make line little bit case found first line hard read let make little bit think get general idea
