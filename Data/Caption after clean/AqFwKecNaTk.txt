line slope negative goes comma equation line slope intercept form line slope intercept form equal x plus b right slope line b intercept linelet draw quick line visualize little bit let draw line since line negative slope ill draw downward sloping line let say line look something like hopefully little familiar slope essentially tell us look start point line point line measure much move x direction run measure much move direction rise slope equal rise run see wed downward sloping move positive x direction go run positive rise negative would negative positive would give negative number make sense downward sloping go situation every step move right downward sloping negative slope well thats slope right intercept tell us intercept intercept point right line intersect point comma band actually fall straight equation x equal let evaluate equation x equal equal times plus b well anything times equal plus b equal b x equal point comma b tell us slope line tell us line slope negative know slope negative tell us line goes comma tell us go let new already used orange let use green color tell us go point comma x x b could say could couple intercept point comma could say b remember also comma b could say b equal know equal negative b equal write equation line slope intercept form equal negative times x plus b plus done
