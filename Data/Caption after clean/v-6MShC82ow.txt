hi rob welcome math antic sin lesson going talk distributive property really useful tool algebra watched video cal led distributive property arithmetic already know basic distributive property works key idea distributive property allow take factor distribute member group thing added multiplying factor entire group whole distribute member group individually previous video saw take problem times group simplify two different ways could either simplify group first could use distributive property distribute copy factor member group matter way go get answer algebra thing little complicated working known involve unknown value variable right algebra might expression like times group x expression know value x could like last expression n could number since know mean simplify group first case option either leave expression like simplify use distributive property eliminate group like arithmetic video distribute copy times member group group goes away end times x plus times time x simplified still know x simplify times write distributed form expression even though simplify expression way single answer without knowing value x know two form expression equivalent follow distributive property distributive property works exactly way whether working variable sin fact algebra l l often see distributive property shown like times group b c equal b acor might see different letter like x z pattern pattern telling two form equivalent first form factor entire group second form factor distributed member group individually looking thinking multiplication remember multiplication default operation show pattern since right next group mean group side since right next b c mean also even though pattern usually shown addition group remember also works subtraction since subtraction negative addition distributive property apply group member basic pattern distributive property usually shown two member group remember works group size could times group b c equivalent distributed form would b c adhere quick example combination variable help see pattern distributive times group x z change distributed form times group b change distributed form times times group x change distributed form ax ay proper whether dealing variable key concept factor outside group get distributed term group term thought term part polynomial sand thought way past would notice fact member group really simple term icing butterfly realizing group thing added really polynomial swill help see distributive property useful algebra example simple expression times group x x simple term polynomial x term variable part number apply distributive property group get equivalent form polynomial little bit complicated times group expression term polynomial number part variable part still use distributive property distribute copy factor term polynomial wait second ear lier said distributive property work member group also term multiplication good question little see works first notice even though term multiplication term added distributed copy factor whole term part termin word treat term polynomial individual member group even term multiplication going inside common since often variable part number part together getting back factor term give us times plus times simplified even know times times distributed form try another example factor times polynomial times group x squared need identify term polynomial distribute factor make one copy term polynomial three term x squared positive negative distribute copy factor term times x squared x squared times since times times negative negative equivalent distributed form x squared see another example x times group x squared expression factor group actually variable distributive property works exactly way say distribute factor multiply term group individually first term x squared x times x multiply x l l get since would three x together next term negative multiply x l l negative times x times x negative x squared last term positive x times positive factor x member original group polynomial x cube x squared distributive property handy algebra show us multiply polynomial factor distribute copy factor polynomial know distribute something member process reverse un distribute something sure look polynomial x cube x squared term polynomial factor number fact look like someone distributed factor term since factor mean making multiple member going multiple factor single copy whole group case remove factor term individually consolidate single factor entire polynomial parentheses turn polynomial group mathematician usually call instead would say polynomial use distributive property ways get expression times group b c distribute copy factor member group given expression b c apply distributive property reverse factor whole group important realize neither value factor ways going back forth two equivalent form expression works case quite obvious example look polynomial number part polynomial even number mean contain factor times times times term common factor mean want factor apply distributive property remove term consolidate form single factor whole polynomial works exactly way variable polynomial x squared ax term common factor could un distribute factor notice last term term becomes always factor term alright basic distributive property works algebra see get pretty complicated big important thing understand works simple case build understanding future able recognize pattern distributive property apply direction swill allow rearrange algebraic expression equation need key really understanding math try working practice actually use v e learned video always thanks watching math antic l l see ya next time learn
