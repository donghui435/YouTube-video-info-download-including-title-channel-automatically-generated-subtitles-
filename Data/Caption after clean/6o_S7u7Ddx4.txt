right video going finding unit vector unit unit vector vector v take vector v divide magnitude length unit vector simply vector point direction original vector going kind alter magnitude length magnitude length one nothing terrible three example let find unit vector direction given get vector one well weve got vector three comma four component three comma four let find magnitude know maybe well call vector v magnitude vector v take component square add together square root squared thats going give square root simply going give us take square root really say unit vector would vector dividing remember happen really think multiplying scalar multiplying well vector comma recall real number front multiply well get give us unit vector going pointing exact direction original simply going length
