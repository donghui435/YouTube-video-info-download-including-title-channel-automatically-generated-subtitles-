people understand two concept video first angle bisector triangle second point meet first let understand angle bisector consider angle say ray b vertex arms two angle formed equal ray b dis cal led angle bisector let erase look angle bisector triangle say triangle three angle angle angle b c angle angle bisector come across something really interesting draw angle bisector triangle let ray ad angle bisector angle would make measure two angle equal let ray e angle bisector angle b two angle formed would equal come interesting part let ray c f angle bisector angle cand give us two equal interesting angle bisector triangle meet atone single point yes true kind triangle acute obtuse scalene isosceles whichever always meet one point construct ing triangle find meet one point mean one thing gone wrong somewhere construction let name point point three angle bisector triangle meet cal led incenter incenter always remain inside triangle irrespective type erase look interest recording recording taken math open roof calm help great deal understanding location incenter triangle meeting center understand location center different kind triangle move point around doesnt matter triangle acute obtuse center always remains inside triangle even move point b around center always remain inside would apply point c center actually center circle circle lie let see look triangle within center point actually center circle touch es sides segment b actually tangent point similarly b c ca tangent point point respectively circle actually completely fit triangle remember point incenter circle cal led circle
