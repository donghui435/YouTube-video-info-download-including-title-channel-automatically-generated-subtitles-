welcome lesson point ordered goal video plot point sin plane also determine point son graph plot point use two perpendicular number line scalled axes horizontal number line cal led positive x value right negative x value left vertical number line cal led positive value negative value point axes cross cal led origin every point plane whats cal led ordered pair every ordered pair consist x x tell whether go left plane tell whether go plane let consider ordered pair stated first x second plot point start origin move horizontally right four x move vertically three make point point go ahead try want plot following point sand think helpful think x whether go left right tell whether need go based upon sign point usually identify point capital point x negative start origin go left three time two make point would point next point point b x go left one go four left one unit four point b point c x go left two unit sand go four point c zero tell us go left right stay right origin need go two unit sand lastly point tell us go right three unit sand zero tell us go stay right point would right go ahead try opposite direction given several point plotted want identify easiest way draw line straight x axis straight see x ordered pair need careful list x first point b x would c x e right follow segment straight x axis would zero point axis right would lastly point f x would would zero check work graph ing calculator graph ing calculator plot going go ahead enter point sin calculator see match es graph way enter point plotted hit key enter well enter x works like excel hit enter drop next cell enter press second equal sand need turn plus press enter blinking hit enter first option plot want x select type point wed like plot ill go ahead leave first option make look exactly like choose window press window change x min x value start go press graph see graph match graph see slide thats nice way check work graph ing calculator hope found video helpful thank nice day
