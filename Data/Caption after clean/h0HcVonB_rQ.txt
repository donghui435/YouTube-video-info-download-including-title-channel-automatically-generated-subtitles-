perpendicular bisector theorem many congruence proof also simple understand let see perpendicular bisector actually say line segment b line l perpendicular bisector true line l intersect segment right angle well divide segment two equal perpendicular bisector segment b point p p equal p b perpendicular bisector theorem say though take random point c line l distance point c segment b always equal distance equal distance case c surely equal b c say another point line l length equal length ad equal b even point e line like equal e equal b e short point perpendicular bisector equidistant point b true see proof next video
