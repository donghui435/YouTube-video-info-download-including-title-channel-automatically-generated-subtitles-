musico kay today want talk generally thought prime first thing want talk intuition behind prime think number like six write two times three word sort break smaller like six prime whereas take number like seven cant break mean guess say write seven seven times one like shouldnt really count seven still seven count prime think term like one prime cant break one intuitively like one prime done research certain tube video sand found number given one prime one seen technical definition make prime people say prime number number exactly two number one ha sonly one factor word one say one therefore prime dont like extremely technical prime number exactly two factor fact doesnt feel like anything intuition behind make prime prime like technicality designed exclude one theres reason want exclude number oneanother explanation seen quite often idea unique factorization sure youve hear theorem extremely extremely useful doesnt get much credit think let say take number like write product write times times tell also product know factorization exactly mean might compare exactly issue people say arise count prime might actually different factorization seven times five times five times two want able say context hey like thats different exclude sort weird case people exclude one prime explanation good great reason hard would say person know one doesnt count context know please factorization mine long chucking middle another reason dont like explanation also historic people long incredibly count one prime one example would look hardy book g h hardy know incredibly incredibly famous analytic number theorist problem text book writing one prime man knew unique prime factorization seem bother enough exclude one prime leaves question real reason well accept idea course one cannot broken product way like say six however thing number one special one every positive whole number example take favorite positive whole number like write equation one times x equal always find positive whole number x equation course quite clear number always works matter number pick put right hand side always find positive whole number x solve equation property special number swith property divide every number system usually cal led gon na try convince armed concept unit separate allow make sense prime unique factorization number may previously thought let give example say wan ted expand realm positive negative think breaking number use positive negative let ask question seven still prime context might seem like ill point write equal negative times negative might confuse course unless aware concept unit see thing like one positive whole negative everything set equation negative times x find integer x always equation think prime think term prime number cant written product two breaking unit shouldnt count much course divide everything also concept unit hand make unique prime factorization clear well example take number like say written times say ah different factorization number look negative times times negative say factorization actually basically youve done maybe switch order around bit sprinkled top many place extremely advanced theres one example id like simply cant resist taken high school algebra may may sometimes write polynomial product two smaller sometimes cant dim sure already sounding familiar turns prime unique factorization extend realm well turns factor say real polynomial polynomial factor polynomial real coefficient factorization exactly except may switched order around bit may know sprinkled mix since get deep leave figure context unique prime factorization look like context think really fun think summarize concept unit prime keeping separate give way conceptual mileage would mix allow distinguish allow think unique prime factorization number algebraic context may encounter life course might happen one day might explore mathematical play mathematical happen context whatever game doesnt really make sense keep one separate maybe type talking something completely different whatever find write thing like let p prime one find situation please start paper write pape rim going allow one prime one blame long clear hope made sense let know didnt forget like video share friend subscribe peace
