hello name maria miller calm video going look fraction first easy case speak easily compare two fraction find one bigger example two eighth three eighth obviously three eighth see picture plus see theres piece eight eight like size compare many like fraction kind piece easy another type situation amount piece four piece still easy compare know bigger piece tent need learn principle look number ten making fraction bigger instead think less nine making whole pie know nine make whole pie divide point tense ach piece smaller tenth smaller ninth might easily visible might visible picture course hundred superaccurate video another type easy situation compare one half three seventh clearly less new half see picture even didnt picture still figure easily know three half seven would exactly one half three point five seven would half three seven less let three also one half would piece took six would exactly one half eleventh sand number six piece six piece piece bigger piece eleventh actually none principle work us easily visualize mind one fifth much know one fifth six nine way half obviously much exercise number line task order three fraction three going use three help us first number line goes zero one divided three part first part second third part therefore much one third right similarly number line divided five part first path second path third much last one divided eight two eighth sand ill find three would much long one third would yeah two fifth would hereto see fraction length line si drew one shor test comes one lastly similarly gon na find would much would long line still shor test comes lastly nice exercise even though doesnt really teach trick heart compare fraction still help student understand number sometimes none easy fraction one method use take work always works convert compare denominator need find common denominator like fraction exact method find common denominator looking find goes evenly goes evenly number thats multiplication table multiplication table works great times times times times compare place piece k might easily visible picture fraction arent fairly close gon na use common denominator simply go times times times fraction side great let kind two fraction cannot quite tell one bigger change nominal times times gon na change see amount past tenth bigger element could converted fraction would also reim gon na staff right denominator thing denominator ill go multiple divisible works k times times times one bet difference fraction need use complicated method note could write mixed doesnt matter use method would choose denominator eight times times times times times practically small
