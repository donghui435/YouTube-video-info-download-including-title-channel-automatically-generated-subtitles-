welcome want speak briefly today harmonic series theres wonderful paradox arise well get moment first harmonic series infinite sum sum plus plus plus plus name harmonic series actually comes story goes visiting blacksmith shop middle bar tap ped vibrate make lovely note simultaneously two set produce make harmonious sound length come whole number ratio ratio wan ted fundamental ratio two ways well deal harmonious series known harmonic series thing people notice peculiar property human exist beyond time good calculate actually add added son forever turns infinite quickly prove one standard result calculus many proof cant like next think kind swift let give name let call ill prove finite number strange property cant possibly hold leave conclude must infinite right sis sum series bigger plus bigger plus plus bigger plus plus plus bigger second sum sum plus plus said plus plus plus fourth son proved value sum bigger value sum cant finite number theres finite number bigger thing clue finite must dealing sort infinite property theres odd little paradox right say infinity however least id say finite oh fact sum add infinite quantity lead gorgeous paradox really quite little squiggle well um another video dis cussed whoops need pen basal problem soil actually take sum square term plus plus plus add finite value pi squared one one half thats amazing actually prove detail video bell problem video see true truth id like give geometric interpretation geometric interpretation first one harmonic series within goes first one series going draw square area totally possible course side length going next ill draw square area quarter course side length ill draw square area side length one third square area think ill pretend imbe yond human forever right let get paint let get one got gallon half paint know area plus area plus area plus area plus finite amount actually paint square fill theres finite amount paint finite paint weird thing theyll go ared pen want draw site bottom sides square know going one unit ink plus half unit ink length something like third plus going take infinite amount ink theres take finite amount paint fill whole area yet us square take engine amount ink actually draw possible finite amount paint fill area termatic paint bottom paradox wonderful thing nut infinite sum theres something mysterious go globally dot dot keep growing forever guess question really becomes dot dot dot really mean think carefully somehow resolve paradox like one cute thanks much
