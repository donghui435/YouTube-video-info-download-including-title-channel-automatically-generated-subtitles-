couple thing learned operation multiply divide inequality negative number flip sign square inequality non negative sign non positive sign four say squaring session look reciprocal value side inequality something like x equal one x equal one nonzero inequality like less sure let try different case first bare positive something like less second negative minus less minus third sign opposite say minus less case let see happen inequality sign take reciprocal sides reciprocal reciprocal inequality sign flip greater case taking sign next case reciprocal minus minus reciprocal minus minus inequality sign minus greater minus positive negative case taking inequality sign third case reciprocal minus minus one two sign flip taking reciprocal dont flip sign opposite sign zero one sides something like zero less minus two less zero reciprocal zero undefined taking reciprocal give us definite answer sign flip inequality different dont talking non zero case cant summarize reciprocal side inequality sign flip inequality different sign dont flip
