welcome following considered standard part algebra really sure goes let graph let suppose one situation mean literally came final exam course realize never actually course youve got go suppose one final exam graph following polynomial little linear let something like x plus times x plus squared plus x fifth say times x minus four thousand six times x minus isle crazy power alright goes didnt go course nonetheless faced question sketch graph function well group four point let following draw set quarter know going graph kind x axis axis vertical one look beast ask interesting x value interesting x value staring mein face example know put negative term becomes give whole polynomial come write note right away know negative graph x equal negative interesting x value put negative formula get something x x sometimes something negative graph must cross x axis also negative right weve got point without knowing anything x equal interesting theres another x intercept x equal another interesting point graph x axis value great theres astart guess name keep try intelligent without really knowing see build picture graph function basic cell seeing thing output ting clever choice x gave ah let talk intercept going positive negative well wont work hard suppose put x equal zero first term going positive next term going positive squared tear would positive fact anything sixth also positive negative six positive number negative post least say intercept squared x fifth times negative times negative going probably huge positive number dont know graph axis positive value right good trick go let try another interesting value x let go something extreme happen put x equal million graph well would million plus cube thats positive term would positive something squared positive million plus fifth positive egg million minus positive especially raised sixth power million minus eight positive special erase power si get huge positive number extreme value x know huge positive value must going like let selling thing trying clever without work fact whats another good interesting x value extreme somehow x equal negative million well thing going change slightly put negative million negative million plus huge negative number thats negative guy something squared stay positive guy something fifth power negative number negative million plus fifth power negative negative million minus negative number six power still positive negative million minus eight power positive net effect get negative x positive x negative x politician positive x equal negative million ill positive number go huge positive extreme right deserve half point right wive graph function know across x axis particular five value know positive intercept must huge positive us go extremely part right whats huge positive us go extremely far left sense connect dot little careful dont really know whats going negative negative say let examine let choose number thats two let say know negative something thats wont actually evaluate let ask graph positive negative point like negative negative negative goes put negative first term positive number put negative middle term second term would negative number get squared positive negative plus negative fifth power negative number raised fifth power negative negative minus negative sixth power positive whatever positive fact able think anything pod even power going positive positive positive think theyre always positive term negative negative negative see whole thing must positive times positive times negative x positive positive negative number let try another value let try negative well let try say negative like guy negative plus positive number cube still positive term something squared still positive middle term negative plus negative fifth power negative stays negative sixth power always positive negative minus n emesis power always positive want negative well negative well already done positive whoops shouldnt put negative one thats silly want negative twixt four eight let try know six well term want cube term must positive always positive term want six plus two eight eight fifth power positive put six positive always positive put six get negative two power positive thing want positive eight something extreme like see already positive well go tell graph want bounce x intercept place work across want positive indicate negative region actually see graph look like theres something like start negative negative hugely positive touch zero fact want negative next certain cut x axis negative going go back negative want negative negative negative graph must come negative fora go back negative graph want positive trick negative graph must something following ilk go back positive next range positive four eight gas graph must bounce positive going back zero eight want positive see graph must something ilk crude sketch tobe honest going strange tell say valid four eighth positive dont really know graph four eight positive felt like every right mind draw graph four eight idea whoops one idea whats actually going maybe graph something like would valid interpretation polynomial thats fine fact study calculus learn graph four eight bump dont know stage ked sketch graph would say thats fine feature thats valid sketch particular try another one let much simpler one thats crazy time let erase well ask ourself
