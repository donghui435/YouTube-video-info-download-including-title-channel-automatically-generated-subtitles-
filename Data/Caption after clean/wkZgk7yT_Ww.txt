ya didnt draw diagram gave one right every time draw insight whats going shape works everything together first question get volume know everyone knew pretty much ever done grade knew multiply something right question many multiply think right multiplication let think right three high four base length arent right cant add length get volume add know length plus length another yeah get perimeter right way around shape addition would happen like different part volume piece together case winding piece need look remember um kind shape let give name today theres triangle right triangular something good prism remember sort form time brought prop help remember going prison prop yeah good idea taking across nature sa sori across look cross section belong way cut way cut way yeah yeah instance cut way way way way gon na get gon na get bunch us gon na get whole bunch different sizes ill get rectangle see dont get smaller rectangle smaller rectangle theyll theyll get lower lower theyre different thats problem right prism way need soar way give shape every time like like loaf bread remember way mike cut half lot different ways length ways like well ways lightly care right gon na draw one one read mind bit go see diagram helpful look look one one front got one back got way little bit see thats weve got work area volume going area triangle thats area triangle say triangle front remember prism least crossed right whats area triangle yep huh times base four good times high case three good go thats area yeah thats first bit multiply one thing get whole volume right since cutting way gon na get slice dimension cutting along six thats cutting huh cutting different spot drawing one diagram feeling yeah thats right mean gon na one aswell another one whole bunch way see triangular bread right number half four three thats half c coincidentally also volume one look always cute always three dimension three right surface area drawing let go shall worth mention ing way theres lots different net instance net cube right instance like see right would fold sides dont spot right instance would also yeah would look bit could still thats people might seen next got one look different thats gon na draw gon na bit antique sitting right think people start base bottom may sure thats shape shape base rectangle good four six good four six looking right four six celebrate base looking top take part kind roof biti suppose yeah like comes around like becomes flat looking gon na right question dimension still get good youve got come onto floor got five day drawn long time people stopped let go back whats going happen else comes base else coming base yeah got part ill fold one well dimension three six yeah good going rectangular whats put yeah people put fine dont spot look kind like doesnt yeah yeah happy need see fall back side going match side theyre three happy times right piece actually hard part got wrong answer piece right getting like thats easiest way make sure dont miss look right see middle part built three rectangle right put three rectangle together whats shape written thank therefore work whole rectangle save bit time right width six surface area six times whats four three nine let stay good done add add many triangle two right great thing right already loo ked triangle didnt look right thats area triangle yeah pop half times four times got six good times six times seven plus double six thats give four surface area squared good
