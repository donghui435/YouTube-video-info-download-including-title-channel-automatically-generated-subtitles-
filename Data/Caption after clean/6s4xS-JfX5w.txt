get welcome tech math channel gon na looking video gon na looking mental subtraction gon na start fairly easy start two digit gon na get harder go along though theres couple different method mental subtraction typically go left right mean minute employ different different type one one trying borrow mean example type question might get ked subtract one number another give us say wan ted take away nice easy one way would guess people would mentally would two different id seen three way doit bad little technique anyway taking weight taking away three id act take away going give another example theres nice easy method start nice dont borrow say say something like going take away nice easy theres made five taking take took got two five got go theyre theyre fairly easy question really basic dont borrowing ill show mean idea borrowing think get bit tricky mental subtraction occasionally start well quite often getting like one subtract stuck getting like ah take away buna see straight away little bit hard easter could go take get take away dime would get theres also another way could might find little bit easier dont sort mental acrobatics much anyway turn bit addition problem way follow gon na round probably gon na realize taken one many take difference wide take away dont supposed take supposed tied one three one two many gon na add one answer take next upside take away plus one turned bit addition problem ill give couple question u h going take away might might round realize take seek much oh show done weve got six much right little six need take away six b trick much right see anyone thinking trying head trick mental subtraction written subtraction try explain methyl subtraction sometimes writing time gon na give bunch question say take new bike advancing really really quickly take away also hundred well take away different question get first mentally take away plus take plus hundred forty eight take away plus one see easy give little bit harder type one say something like dim going take away hey thats hard actually thats really easy one almost take gon na plus answer going rounded took weve got added extra need got see easy iso kay next video would let look extend bigger hopefully find handy look next video well take even anyway thanks watching see next time bye
