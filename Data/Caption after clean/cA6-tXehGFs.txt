think green thing stationary point point running towards right speed point stationary running towards right speed far point one houri simple question point stationary running towards right speed one hour somewhere starting point comes speed concept used relate position stationary point every hour keep moving kilometer away point thats say speed kilometer per hour relative stationary object think another situation take stationary point point speed right b travel direction speed leave starting point time ask another question speed b relative ked speed b relative stationary point ked speed b relative let make space know relative speed let look one hour dont forget leave time somewhere kilometer away starting point thats travel per hour b travel kilometer per hour would somewhere kilometer away starting point ked speed b relative find distance b first hour distance one distance tell us us distance increase kilometer one hour travel one hour distance increase kilometer say speed b relative gap kilometer every hour get difference speed b minus per hour two leave time traveling direction relative speed difference individual speed understand first case imagine seated back seat car see stationary object start moving kilometer per hour see distance object increasing understand case imagine car car right next start moving time move per hour kilometer per hour distance car one increasing yes compare previous case relative speed lower second case moving away car rate rate away stationary object two car moving opposite direction let see green stationary point car amove towards left speed per hour car b right speed per hour car leave time relative speed hour let starting point speed hour car somewhere kilometer away starting point starting point distance one hour kilometer distance increase rate per hour thats relative speed every hour distance increase kilometer another case car moving opposite car b apart move towards right speed car left speed moving towards opposite relative speed think know answer let seethe position one hour original distance one hour car away point car b ten kilometer away point hour ago distance b whats distance total minus give us kilometer one hour distance reduced minus kilometer sand relative speed also kilometer per hour get sum individual speed plus hour two thing start time move direction relative speed difference individual speed start time opposite direction relative speed sum next sessions look example based concept relative speed
