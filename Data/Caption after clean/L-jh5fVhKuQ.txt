understand type angle need understand one simple diagram consider array know ray rotated completely cover degree lie classified type two kind important angle come across often mathematics first kind angle like cover one fourth let call ray see angle formed cal led right angle since cover one fourth degree sit measure degree angle special many ways angle marked curve normally angle mark like curve two arms right angle marked like mark dont even need write measure next since two enough tell right angle angle degree say perpendicular next important kind angle see often cal led straight angle say arm rotated way straight line formed like let arm e angle formed ay e equal degree scalled straight angle straight angle cover half complete rotation degree one fourth complete rotation right angle half complete rotation cal led straight angle actually straight line two special angle look figure closely divide plane let color blue region yellow region degree degree entire red ridge line degree purely based angle figure consider rate initial arm angle angle blue region cal led acute another ray b blue region angle formed angle angle degree acute angle formed terminal arm yellow region obtuse angle let another ray yellow region angle formed scalled obtuse angle mean angle measure degree cal led obtuse angle angle red region cal led angle ray oh f like entire angle starting ray oh reflex angle reflex angle always greater degree less degree ray g like big angle would angle simple angle degree acute degree obtuse degree one way remember knowing letter alphabetical order recording math open roof calm help us understand better terminal arm anywhere degree acute angle move terminal arm anywhere angle still acute degree becomes right angle two ray said perpendicular anywhere degree obtuse angle see wide range angle covered degree angle still opt us degree geta straight line straight angle anywhere degree reflex angle terminal arm entire region result reflex angle one full rotation cal led full
