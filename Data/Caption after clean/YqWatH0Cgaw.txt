welcome ad fell name hero form area triangle solely side links normally look triangle b c say area base times height well base vary depending one would look case looking base c guess height altitude triangle actually difficult figure especially give three side name said like look air triangle good luck fellow hero actually way work form area triangle based solely youve given side links id like actually derive formula proof difficult pepper concept easy algebra involved becomes quite quite nasty oh one approach probably classical purse thats available young student discovered theorem keen algebra might go suppose let let go ill need pen suppose triangle guess ill call base b time c actually draw height house going split two part ill call x b minus x inner area triangle base times height though trouble dont want working height well use theorem left path triangle tell x squared plus h squared ill use theorem right half triangle tell us b minus x squared plus h squared c squared let expand guy b squared minus x plus x squared plus h squared equal c squared look recognize x square h square squared tell b squared minus b x plus c go ahead let grin give formerly nation want form h let doit x would squared plus b squared minus c squared let substitute back original formula get format h tell h squared squared minus x squared going save little bit whoa let go back multiply thats say b h square squared b squared h squared want work woman area go h squared directly right squared b squared times h squared thing squared minus x squared well goes else becomes bit nightmare formula x secure get right squared b u u u minus squared plus b squared minus c squared move missy han running look like four let sput sort common denominator multiplying four squared four squared b squared minus squared plus b squared minus c squared squared thats grand typically got formula area triangle divide sides take square root weve done thats fine thats version form actually went little bit without tool outer wasnt till history mathematics nonetheless wrote formula quivered following hero somehow business papyrus bond sandy shore working expression sorry tedious squared clever fellow plus b plus c times plus b minus c times b plus c times negative plus b plus c fact want want expand see indeed equivalent divide everything divide term square root area triangle thats actually nicely nicely people recognize plus b plus c printer triangle mean half call semiperimeter really happen youve got square root semiperimeter time actually plus c minus really semiperimeter minus c divide times senator minus b times semi printed minus lot book actually percept formula form thats thats work area triangle knowing nothing side length quite beautiful quite swift messy algebra conceptual perfume exercise algebra following let draw triangle drew drew might good exercise trigonometry class b c let look one angle intriguing rapture class area triangle half c sine theta product two side leg angle theta times sine theta also law cosine tell b squared actually square c squared minus cosine theta well suggest solve sine theta first equation solve cosine second equation use fact sine squared theta plus cos squared theta equal one substitute former precise date ill get area substitute father ninth day ill get side length b c appear ing must formula area triangle term original beaten see youve got page algebraic facility end able formula little exercise maybe going little bit mean could possibly tell formula size triangle ten twelve twenty three little practice put formula see get see explain whats going right thanks much
