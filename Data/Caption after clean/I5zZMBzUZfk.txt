hello welcome section calculus extra practice integration section want learn calculate area right lot far learning calculate integral teaching integral really area curve way occasionally given two curve want find area two curve thats going learn today easiest way handle talk draw quick picture let draw quick little set know x axes let draw couple thing axis first draw curve could shape well call f x draw dashed b find area curve f x b would well pretty easy weve done lot would integrate f x function b limit integration thats going yield area curve way curve way weve tal ked point gave another curve said x g x look different ill put x said find area g x curve x axis b would say well thats easy integrate g x b integration thats going give surface area way graph way x axis know find told find surface area f graph geo graph word would actually find surface area surface area way x axis find right label let say find well think integral curve way integral curve way able find area integral basically subtract entire area take entire area subtract area whatever difference going whats thats exactly theres really nothing else concept area case region equal integral f x minus g x x integrate b go along boundary really really theres nothing nothing else take two function subtract integrate theres know couple ways could could integrate b f x get answer could integrate g x band get answer could take two separate answer subtract going get exactly thing get function weve integrate added like first one second one case subtract ing typically written calculus book really taking area minus area second one thats getting
