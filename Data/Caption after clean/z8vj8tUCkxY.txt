let see give little practice converting radian degree sand degree radian sand review let remind relationship always convert two one revolution circle many radian going well know one revolution circle radian sand many degree one revolution around circle well know degree si either write little degree symbol like write like really enough information us think convert radian want simplify little bit divide sides pi radian equal another way think going halfway around circle radian pi arc subtend angle pi thats also degree sand wan na really think well many degree per radian divide sides piso divide sides pi would get one radian would go plural singular one radian equal divided sides wan ted figure many radian sare per degree divide sides would get radian sis equal degree think ready start converting let convert let think going write actually might remind unit analysis might first unit conversion also works write degree sand brain like work like write word degree swell wan na convert radian really want figure many radian per degree let write wan na figure many radian per degree havent filled many see cancel degree times degree cancel ill left multiply number degree times number radian per degree gon na get radian sand hopefully make intuitive sense well think well think way pi radian many degree well thats degree comes straight right pi radian every degree going get us going get times times simplify equal write radian equal radian snow let go think radian sand wan na convert going get convert degree swell gon na want figure many degree per radian one way think think pi every degree pi essentially equivalent thing essentially multiplying quantity radian cancel cancel left either write word degree write like let think degree sand ill write like figure notation well many radian equal gon na want think many radian per degree going multiply know pi every even write way pi radian every degree sand might little less intuitive degree cancel thats usually like word left let write word written thats intuitive thinking term notation degree times pi radian every left times pi degree left equal half half equal pi let say negative going degree swell figure many degree sare know every pi gon na get radian cancel cancel write hopefully found helpful ill couple example problem example better hopefully become little bit intuitive
