last video saw geometric progression geometric sequence sequence successive term previous term fixed value call fixed value common ratio example sequence right term previous term common ratio nonzero value common ratio even negative value example could geometric sequence look like maybe start one maybe common say negative times negative negative times negative positive times negative negative negative times negative positive could keep going want focus video sum geometric progression geometric sequence would call geometric scroll little bit going talk geometric series really sum geometric sequence example geometric series would sum sequence said plus negative plus negative plus go would geometric series could one really make clear said plus plus plus plus geometric series sum geometric sequence geometric progression would represent general term sigma notation well well start whatever first term want speak general could call first term well start first term successive term going going times common ratio well call common ratio r second term times r third term going multiply one times r going times r keep going plus times r third power let say going finite geometric series going keep going say keep going way get times r na times r nth power represent sigma notation encourage pause video try well could think way ill give little hint could view term right times r let write times r times r first r squared r third pattern might write sum capital sigma right start index could say k equal way n times r k th power sigma notation general way represent geometric series r nonzero common ratio even negative value
