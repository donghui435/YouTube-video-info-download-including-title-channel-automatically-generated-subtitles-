want talk n sa surveillance thats news lately people dont know doit actually sort eavesdrop well turns sophisticated math super long super big show sound good yeah love number swell set little bit want talk little bit something know use everyday life clock let say start start working work five finish finish know calculate nine plus five get p plus get result like sort take remainder cal led clock arithmetic also mathematics call modular arithmetic say plus modulo modulo mean retain remainder likewise imagine clock doesnt whole number number example could could could know actually mathematics best clock prime number turns actually really sophisticated thing arithmetic course sophistication feel number becomes modulo modulo much room create something complicated could use encryption say number know open opportunity something people crack example send credit card number line send get scramble unscramble end point based kind arithmetic arithmetic large non prime number ill show actual involved bit let explain little bit algorithm based first well based clock arithmetic already understand one layer also look equation kind equation go algorithm n sa able crack call elliptic curve elliptic curve something equation like squared equal x cube minus plus thats equation two variable x solve equation mean find two x side equal right hand side crucial element exactly look many option course obvious choice would look say real actually give us curve look something like know every point x plug equation left hand side equal right hand side thats obvious way think armed new arithmetic clock arithmetic also look solution modulo prime number right nothing stop us example choose x element set possible seven hour clock try look pair x left hand side equal right hand side way get something like think assort like sub maybe point son kind curve solution sure well begin x take value sort think curve course take large prime number many take small one like whole industry mathematics cal led elliptic curve cryptography elliptic curve cryptography scramble standard area set national institute standard technology abody united responsible kind thing came standard fact read public knowledge classified algorithm call dual dual elliptic curve deterministic generator see elliptic curve prominently featured equation exactly equation wrote well simplify simple equation pick prime number document actually give detail provide p see first give clock youve ever seen look many thats thats clock theyre code thats right curve equation theyre many day many used sense right additional additional data used algorithm use data result create something look totally random live curve curve used produce actually important problem mathematics produce look completely random encryption algorithm used encrypt specific specific credit card number something based algorithm would actually credit card working thats flow chart start something theres sort like loop number sand get scramble output number extract way setup completely random word somebody read cannot predict whats next coming addition equation addition prime number given make work pair solution need stick thats right kick start keep going used run cycle produce next one next one next one q used kind scramble output cycle theory nobody would able predict whats whats know next one think solution point curve difficult find huge easy government agency sort simplify ing life theyre saying look dont look well give well give two p maybe q let give actually see oh big money sorry big money shot q x q government say solution sand actually anybody public information public knowledge anybody take substitute equation see indeed satisfied found suggest use two run number random number generator used equation government start flow chart machine werent generating exact good one seed also start something choose course thats distinguish sequence people sequence give p q kind like two step provide information run step procedure right mult procedure need two point implicit suggestion kind random p q kind random dont bear relation almost like give two random village say like youve never dont know know distance expect one else would know may good analogy course case village easily find distance imagine something actually would incredibly hard find relation imagine somebody actually know relation find actually know relation point case backdoor use information sort distance two village use able predict outcome algorithm know observe period time see coming actually find next one sare going sort throw sa whole sort monkey wrench procedure way peek encryption algorithm rely random number generator thats n sa got mean able find relation mathematician though cant make equation yes thats point thing hard find relation dont already know actually basis whole whole idea encryption based clock arithmetic certain problem clock arithmetic intractable would even network able find solution video description going bunch links look thats going dis cussed video theyre public document continuation discussion professor didnt make video cover whole range interesting topic like people maybe problem spoon fed information also importance mathematics world days worth look ill also include professor frank hill book cal led love math really good worth look mathematics book lastly thank everyone support watching great fun making video like hopefully theres going lot
