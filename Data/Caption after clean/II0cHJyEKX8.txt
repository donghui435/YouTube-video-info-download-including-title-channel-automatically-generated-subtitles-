construct ing orthocenter triangle orthocenter intersection three altitude triangle need construct three altitude triangle start top vertex remember construct altitude position compass vertex need cut arc intersect opposite sign two times go two intersection point need make x arc connect ing vertex point give first altitude know altitude going intersect going make altitude quite let go ahead move vertex right see needs reach opposite side right going extend side make altitude without cant geta angle right going extend repeat process put compass need cut twice probably make little bigger two intersection point need mark create x connect vertex intersection point altitude see meet degree angle alright let go third need head side picture getting little bit messy going clean little bit dont get confused vertex need hit opposite side going need extend take compass cut art two intersection point need cut another arc create x connect vertex intersection point theres altitude right see three one central point central point copy orthocenter
