identify acute obtuse image let remind acute obtuse right angle acute angle angle less degree sand ill write right right word acute right angle right angle angle equal whose measure equal obtuse angle obtuse angle angle greater greater degree less degree could view way greater degree less obtuse angle obtuse angle less degree dont ask us angle degree form straight line really cal led straight angle let look diagram start acute angle ill acute angle purple know less degree swell look real information given box right angle right right angle actually let start right angle actually might little bit interesting tell us right right angle already know one right angle angle q r would vertex could also angle r q angle q ar q actually tell us measure actually degree degree angle q angle right angle q reason know angle also right take q ar take q r one combine q actually form straight angle way around like sum needs degree r q also another way think next actually array common adjacent angle put look outer edge actually form straight angle would call two add thats another definition supplementary add one one degree let look let acute angle give us lot information entire angle q degree make q degree example q p angle right q p measure angle less degree part degree angle youd add angle right actually get degree actually less degree one acute angle angle q p q p another acute angle angle p angle p know add two angle together get less assuming neither angle zero degree acute angle well another angle look acute angle ras angle ras reason feel pretty good less degree keep line q ray right extended way let say mythological point x cal led x angle r ax would ras less less degree think got acute acute angle got two let think obtuse angle degree degree one obtuse obtuse angle went q q q cal led si q si q definitely obtuse angle contain degree angle even si q angle q definitely obtuse id temp ted say si p si p straight angle went way around like degree would actually straight angle officially obtuse angle notice cal led straight angle form straight line two edge angle form straight line going include going include si another obtuse angle another obtuse angle ill different like p angle p contain q degree open even wide rit open even see straight angle purpose consider obtuse found everything found everything missing something one would straight angle soh wait saw one course also angle right big blank spot wasnt paying attention also angle right angle angle reason know mythological point x would continue continue q direction would know degree angle opening degree angle also also obtuse think got let see think although yep done
