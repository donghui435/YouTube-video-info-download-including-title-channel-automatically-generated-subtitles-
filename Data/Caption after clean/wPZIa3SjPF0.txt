type quadrilateral specific possible given data clearly quadrilateral four sides see two pair parallel sides could also say two pair congruent sides well side parallel congruent side side parallel congruent dealing look like type scenario saw last two pair parallel congruent sides sides arent equal theyre equal wed dealing rhombus theyre equal side congruent side opposite side congruent side opposite thats another parallelogram interesting two pair sides parallel sides equal length would parallelogram parallelogram theyre saying specific possible given data saying rhombus would specific saying parallelogram satisfy parallelogram saying us even every parallelogram rhombus every rhombus parallelogram sides parallel side opposite sides type quadrilateral specific possible given data two pair sides parallel say one pair pair sides parallel another pair sides trapezoid two choice trapezoid isosceles trapezoid isosceles trapezoid trapezoid two nonparallel sides length like isosceles triangle two sides length well could see two nonparallel sides length isosceles trapezoid length would pick would specific trapezoid case right one type quadrilateral well could say parallelogram sides parallel wan ted specific could also see sides could say rhombus could get even specific notice sides right wan ted specific possible square let check answer got right
