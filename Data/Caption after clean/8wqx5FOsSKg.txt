many object geometry real life symmetry define symmetry well object exist isometry cell reflection rotation maybe even translation map figure back onto isometry figure symmetry another way thinking reflectional symmetry half figure mirror image half also describe reflectional symmetry term line symmetry two interchangeable let apply know reflectional symmetry specific example find reflectional symmetry mean line could pentagon could fold pentagon back onto identical image well see could draw line reflection right would enable fold pentagon onto could draw perpendicular one vertices perpendicular opposite side total five reflectional symmetry move asquare see could dry line symmetry half two sides could fold could also draw horizontal line symmetry also draw diagonal symmetry would enable fold figure back onto regular pentagon five square four symmetry equilateral triangle well equilateral triangle similarly line vertex perpendicular opposite side could draw two equilateral triangle three symmetry look triangle label two sides congruent one line symmetry drew another line would mirror image talking scaling triangle well let say gave length symmetry reflectional symmetry scaling triangle back exactly reflectional symmetry specific definition symmetry reflect half figure back onto
