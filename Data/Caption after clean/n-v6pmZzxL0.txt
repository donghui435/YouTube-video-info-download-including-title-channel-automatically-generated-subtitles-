think best way start video puzzle smaller version perhaps saw thumbnail well build one later start two nail two thumbtack wall want han g picture two nail sand loop wire around nail way like tie loose end string wire picture long good stipulation remove either nail picture fall remove first nail leaving second alone picture fall remove second nail leaving first alone picture fall say trick question way completely possible really want actually try find two nail two thumbtack wall work pencil paper dont feel like getting thats style surprisingly actually infinitely many answer gon na share one go around first nail clockwise go around second nail also clockwise go back first nail loop around counterclockwise second nail counterclockwise notice picture remove either first nail second nail picture fall real question know would work turns incredibly beautiful mathematical explanation behind extraordinarily excited share say found two nail version problem easy may excited hear arbitrarily many nail version problem imagine million nail wall way loop string around one million nail picture remove one whole thing collapse picture fall found nail version problem easy maybe pause video work one mean time however explain everyone else going going call moving around first nail clockwise moving around second nail clockwise b dont keep saying move around first nail clockwise move around second know whatever also going call moving around first nail counterclockwise inverse similarly moving around second nail counterclockwise b inverse finally going call configuration nothing dont wrap around nail picture simply fall create kind analogy stuff multiplying worth however initially kind seem work mean think get picture fall similarly get picture fall thing b know b b give picture fall least initially intuition seem agree notation pretty cool new lingo place want go back solution gave original problem remember first went around first nail clockwise thats around second nail clockwise b around first nail counterclockwise one level clear solution works get rid first nail thats thing getting rid term left b times picture fall similarly get rid second nail thats thing getting rid b left times give picture fall super awesome however clearly something fishy going explain configuration allow picture han g first place really like number multiplication everything would cancel right start picture would han g clearly even though might look like number multiplication something different give talking name number multiplication commutative mean order multiply affect answer going b everything cancel would expect picture fall however solution switched order beginning picture han g though seem though cancel right next b cancel also right next dealing clearly much commutative order definitely matter keeping standard mathematical going stop writing replace inverse b inverse reason part prevent temptation cancel wherever may see rewrite original solution problem way becomes b inverse b inverse actually little doohickey special name mathematics cal led commutator commutator incredibly important idea mathematics actually id remiss mention secretly sort stepped ubiquitous vastly branch mathematics cal led group theory obviously cant really justice group theory like minute tube video decade long tube video would enough um going leave come exciting interesting know looping string around nail number want make example particularly interesting like string around nail example particularly exciting number want tell use solve version problem dont know like million nail wall b b commutator would turn one triviality test whether order b matter let give two example place comes technical cube let say rotating side degree rotating side degree b notice b b get different cube depending b first also seen icing b inverse b inverse return original cube one example take hexagon want think perform hexagon perform outline start one example would rotating degree rotate degree end rotation outline start another example would vertical axis say along vertical axis rotating degree b b b b inverse b inverse return original hexagon course depending taste lots advanced come non course interesting hope convinced widely occur ring phenomenon useful understand theres lot non make example string nail particularly interesting going try illustrate two sho wed remember case hexagon along axis rotating degree b let say b b notice return back original whats interesting found way return back original without backtrack ing like backwards get back original definitely interesting systematic took attitude explorer might let say trying draw map start location location figure b thing location figure b notice however b doesnt actually take anywhere new doesnt bring new state havent already take back b take back similarly back original found map looplike way go one back one without finish map way whole picture would look like see lots loop map calling actually cal led cay ley graph want look cay ley graph know pick move interested case move picked b draw map know place move take case map look like may interested hear cay ley graph loop well let say b c back original cube interesting way get back original without course cant show full cay ley graph cube quintillion different cube take may seem like lot realize humble situation two nail sand string looping around cay ley graph actually infinite whats loop let say b inverse b inverse cay ley graph look like see beautiful structure get sense shape despite infinite nature amazing see beautiful mathematics hidden inside two nail sand string unfortunately cant prove cay ley graph correct mathematics beyond scope video however one practical implication pretty much however wrap string around picture guarantee han g mean think let say b b times b inverse times times say accidentally made back one loop cay ley graph way could get back bunch stuff stuff backwards would course cause everything start three nail going call going around clockwise b c going around counterclockwise inverse b inverse c inverse trick shove commutator inside know b inverse b inverse turn one get rid b unfortunately combination involve c going rectify replace b commutator band c b inverse commutator c b well first notice two commutator actually inverse get rid wind next every also getting rid either b c cause go away cause every thing cancel ten move combination involve three nail work indeed try removing nail actually fall find extremely satisfying know keep something similar want increase number nail four nail could replace commutator inverse commutator let actually five nail guess ill replace commutator e inverse commutator e combination though picture one still pure right got done edit ing video first wan ted say thank much new thing wan ted say corded lot material video wound making stuff large scale demonstration well big physics simulation lots nail unfortunately stuff didnt really fit tone video also made way way long maybe ill revisit stuff another day figure engaging way tell think thats dont forget subscribe havent already peace
