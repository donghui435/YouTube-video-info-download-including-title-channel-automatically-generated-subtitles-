let start interesting problem sand one thing find probability always interesting problem going think take fair coin flip three want find probability head three easiest way think many equally likely last video saw flip coin times theres first flip theres flip theres third flip times times equally likely coin many least head well drew count many least head thats least head last one least head probably thinking k sal able writing would really hard least one head worked well make clear flip would lot harder time consuming flip sis short cut way think simple way cant say oh probability head times probability head first time dont get head could get head dont becomes little bit complicated easy way think could use methodology right actually see lot make seem like harder problem think right way sudden becomes way think probability head flip thing thing probability getting tail right got tail dont least head two thing equivalent probability getting least head flip sis thing probability getting tail flip whats probability getting tail swell thats going minus probability getting probability getting tail since probability tail tail situation sare going least head thats leftover possibility add together going get write write new color coming probability tail plus probability tail well essentially exhaustive possible chance getting either tail mutually exclusive add probability tail clear probability probability tail going equal one mutually either going tail head show going cant thing happening since theyre mutually exclusive saying probability happening could add essentially possible essentially combine probability event happening thats going chance another way think probability tail going probability thats right probability tail pretty straightforward thats probability going chance getting tail first flip times let write little clearer going minus probability getting chance getting tail son first flip get another tail second flip going tail third flip times times going minus minus going equal apply problem harder writing first problem let say flip probability least one head flip well use idea going equal probability tail flip saying probability getting flip going flip tail tail flip sand going minus probability times minus tail row going equal part right write going one let rewrite equal minus part going well one tail another tail times going times let write little thats really numerator going going going equal color going equal minus numerator times times thats denominator times times exact thing minus equal common denominator blue flip coin times row fair probability getting least head sin flip pretty high get calculator figure term percentage actually let fun divided give us chance going least one round equal chance rounded little bit actually slightly even slightly higher pretty powerful tool pretty powerful way think would taken forever write scenario fact would scenario write exercise taken time think slightly different way say look probability getting head flip probably getting tail sand thats minus probability getting tail sand actually pretty easy thing think
