welcome video hello little tidbit three dimensional geometry shape summer cylinder acone talking volume come recent conversation thought ill make video let first cylinder given choosing figure plane ill something sort like halfway polygon circular shape making congregate plane parallel connect ing edge point saw matching make three dimensional object cone similar figure one plane choose point directly plane make circus tent cut type construction connect ing point boundary bottom figure live much current point make circus tent let see well known volume thing given well volume thunder area base say times h h height object anda area base oh thats basic definition volume begin mean cylinder previous video proved without calculus video ill use calculus make life little bit easier volume cone actually going exactly quite surprising one third area cylinder got volume cylinder times area times base times height volume cone one third times area base area base times height well id like know object thats two theres actually half area base times height thing object thats describe going simple construct dont think somehow whats whats halfway top base thats full figure top base thats point really construct acone took whole top base cylinder pinched single point pinched left right back forth pecan strict theyll halfway operation pinching left right back forth single point pinch one direction make line segment gon na bit tricky draw go let pinch top pinched whoops need pen line segment base due line segment two point son boundary figure create object sense really halfway twixt two claim volume beast half way half area base times height look video prove volume area cup volume cone without calculus actually used technique actually way technique well ill leave exercise modify proof shape previous video middle shape doable ill assume calculus belt prove correct volume formula calculus k go well calculus volume shape given cross section four cylinder cross section dont change level shape area always make life easier let call top level zero assume going x way h set say volume cylinder going integral zero h cross section intersection area x x x h thats ah indeed volume cylinder cone going x way h cross section area guess red think going scaled copy base whats scale factor well scale factor actually going actually scale factor x h area squared mean area cross section level x actually area times x h squared volume cone going given integral zero h cross section section area x third comes integral x squared one third ill get one third h squared h squared h well imagine whats going strange shape whose name know name sense weve done something strange weve taken cross section area brought perpendicularly direction line segment point shrinking current showing way toa point direction x h squared claim really x h right skip except h area scale factor go explain claim area liberal x given case true thats right volume integral h ax ill see hath comedown h squared h half explain area cross section level x going x h well u thats hard see need space done boot getting messy thats actually probably bad video sorry well essentially weve done shape whoops need pen theres shape segment squish ing shape x factor reducing height sa little bit want know area change change factor k case x h thats far zero calculus idea little rectangle gone certain height one value height thats k times high gone length whatever length k times length width change still approximately ear strip rectangle transformation height rectangle change width rectangle therefore area rectangle literally k k naught k squared know take area whole would sort know limit taking final final height k mean area k yes one direction scare factor k area object k mean volume beast indeed one times h alright challenge find mick ey type way proving might see video volume cone second challenge volume cylinder goes pen volume cylinder area base times height volume cone third base times height falling move strange object one half base times height well object goes line three quarters base times height object goes say oh two half sixth base times height fact make sense fraction desire twixt oh one third create nice geometric object whose volume given fraction cylinder stop something natural way volume quarter base times height good fun thing think
