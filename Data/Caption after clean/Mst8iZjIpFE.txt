last section learned one important thing learned written like division also know fraction used represent smaller part thing snow since fraction division problem wan ted could go ahead division get answer answer would regular number value fractionlet look fraction example division problem divided know divided value fraction deal value n seem like smaller part something seem like two fraction supposed value smaller one top number fraction bigger bottom value fraction greater one top number smaller bottom value fraction smaller one divide smaller number bigger number get value smaller one going write value like regular number write besides zero luckily answer see write value smaller one something cal led decimal understand decimal work let first review write regular involve call whole use whole count thing counting thing important math system count thing based number fact cal led base call group building block count probably surprise first building block get bigger building block multiplying next building block times one times one times could keep multiplying get bigger bigger building block think going stop going well like said building block counting system going count mention two thing number system needs besides building block sand two thing number place different symbol use know place like little imaginary box es hold one digit time used like count use one number place building block count many example let say hundred well put number place count many hundred let say put number place count also put number place count number place name building block example number place cal led place count place count hundred place count hundred course used seeing written like let rearrange number place make look like used see hundred place place combine make time actually show number use building block number place write whole number want video fraction right going write fraction system lot fraction value smaller one right building block look like going need smaller building remember got base building star ted kept multiplying get bigger bigger building get smaller building block start keep dividing minute smaller number like bigger number like well like fraction building block get fraction value one part ten use write value smaller good way see new building block look number line oh look number line goes zero ten show first two building block take divide ten equal part part equal take divide ten equal part part tenth number line show three building block tenth small number get even smaller building block keep dividing let take one tenth divide equal even smaller fraction cal led hundredth one hundred since would take equal see taking tenth dividing part snow count smaller part l l find could keep dividing number line get smaller smaller building l l show even easier way find let list building block far notice side first building block side first building block back next building block side side next building block side suppose next building block side course could keep going either direction getting bigger bigger whole smaller smaller think enough new smaller fractional building block sit mean count smaller smaller part going need new number place cal led tenth place count tenth sand hundredth place count hundredth sand thousandth place count see new number place work let bring back last example hundred time let add tenth tenth place hundredth hundredth place let put number place back like used seeing look like problem number look like twenty five thousand three hundred sixty four added tiny little fraction big tell number place look need kind marker help us tell apart marker cal led decimal point decimal point dot always put right place tenth way always know place left decimal point tenth place better number read point read decimal point get say point decimal point really separator number place count whole side number place count fraction side amount greater amount smaller call use decimal point decimal decimal decimal work important use convert fraction division problem regular number next section l l learn convert special fraction let quick review take fraction division get answer answer cal led value fraction number system cal led base building block counting well different place like hold one digit time help us count many base building block number made base building block like help us make really big also small base building block fraction smaller help us make really small building block like tenth hundredth decimal point separator goes number place count value greater number place count value smaller make sure understand decimal work relate fraction sure ya n see coming
