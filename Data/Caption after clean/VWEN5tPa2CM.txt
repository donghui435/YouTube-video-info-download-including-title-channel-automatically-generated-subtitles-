hi welcome math antic video going learn important math concept cal led rounding help understand rounding let think usually used time used amount thing like many supermarket many days birthday many student went high school many student went high school oh um wasnt exactly well like probably wasnt exactly well right see first number used represent high school round number good estimate many student wasnt exact next two little closer truth final exact amount student sat school three estimate sare rounded version exact count different precision precise estimate least precise estimate rounding number making less precise version see theres usually multiple ways round number depending level precision need really good way understand whats going round number look number line want round nearest need decide goes want nearest need decide goes want round nearest need decide goes case decision based round number closer original exact number might wondering would ever want make numberless precise first place rounding good well rounding number scan often make lot easier like would lot easier quickly add would add sometimes dont need much precision like might need know dog weigh point eight three nine seven kilogram fifty five point eight kilogram might precise enough like irrational tobe rounded cant keep writing decimal forever know rounding rest video going focus learning procedure follow round remember number system based digit number particular number place number place name according amount represent count important know rounding number ked round specific number place example may round number nearest tenth nearest might round number nearest tenth hundredth may even ked round nearest whole number another way round place ked round number first step pay close attention number place need round number place important represent unit counting keep rounded version number fact number place digit inside important going give special name video let call target rounding number new less precise version new number place smaller automatically get case number place target automatically kept new rounded version exception well see later video seem pretty simple bigger keep smaller zero target digit well going one two thing either going keep digit going increase one keep target digit thats might seem first mean leaving digit rounding remember going automatically replace smaller place zero make rounded number smaller even target digit stays hand increasing target digit scalled rounding since new rounded number original number right decide know keep target digit increase one key look digit next smaller number place digit thats right target digit digit less word well leave target digit rounded version digit greater well increase target digit k know basic procedure rounding let try specific example round nearest hundred since need round nearest hundred first need identify digit hundred digit six thats target know target rounded version next target digit either keep increase one decide look value next digit right since digit less round well keep target digit rounded number last keep bigger number place rounded version rounded original number nearest hundred answer thousand six hundred let try another problem one decimal thirty two point seven two five round nearest whole number mean target digit place need round nearest one place well rounded version decide target digit look next digit right since digit seven well roundup time mean increase target digit one finally keep left target digit case thats three weve rounded number thirty three point zero zero zero since dont really need extra decimal point ready one point seven nine nine one nearest hundredth first step identify hundredth place target place contain digit nine smaller zero rounded version next need decide leave target digit increase one look digit right target nine also well definitely since target digit already nine raising one little complicated add one digit thats already nine need change zero increase digit next bigger number place mean target digit become zero need increase digit next bigger number place digit seven well increase eight rest original number kept rounded version rounded version point eight zero see actually left target sort domino effect happen rounding lot nine rounding bump like chain reaction like need round nearest place tell us need round target digit one already nine need zero increase next number place thats already nine need increase next number place thats already nine pattern continue end upwith two million final sometimes rounding number pretty simple times little involved key remember rule digit right target less five leave target digit five increase target digit one even cause chain reaction bigger number right know lot rounding know youve seen basic procedure action watching video rounding enough get really good way practice sure try rounding fact rounding important math skill probably practice lot youve really got always thanks watching math antic ill see next time learn math antic c om
