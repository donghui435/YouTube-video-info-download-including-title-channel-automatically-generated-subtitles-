hey everyone weve getting lot graph cube root let go ahead example together focus graph cube root function specific domain well restricted domain cube root function going look like either f x equal equal cube root something let move example together want graph function cube root x minus domain negative call restricted domain since care function act negative positive care one portion think table value function want x value positive since looking plot point really concerned x value find value find point plot graph construct function first x value negative want take value replace x original function evaluate negative equal negative cube root negative equal negative x negative negative first point going tobe graph find rest value table repeat process x value use table calculator input ting function equal would cube root x minus either way allow find value input value x keep mind going get lot since certain number sare perfect thats complete table ready plot point construct graph want touse point x integer dont want estimate location value also well see five point enough create accurate sketch function starting first point negative negative go ahead plot five point eventually draw graph mistake student often make connect straight result graph incorrect boom graph cube root curved need connect point curved line graph function equal cube root x minus domain negative another thing look since domain restricted include arrow end point graph concerned graph negative positive dont care beyond domain graph afunction cube root restricted domain piece thank much guy check ing us please subscribe tube channel free animated math week
