first one n minus two times sum interior angle polygon interior want show quickly comes say example polygon like divide triangle know sum measure triangle add particular polygon drew sides minus see theres three triangle equal thats formula comes play two less triangle sides angle polygon always going tobe less formula n times divided n use trying find measure one interior angle regular mean angle sare sides length find total measure interior angle sand divide many give measure one interior angle formula divided n find measure one exterior angle thats saying outside polygon regular polygon meaning angle take divided n last one sum exterior angle polygon theyre always going doesnt regular theyre always going example extend know sides like angle outside polygon going add like circle let get example ill show work excuse polygon see could count sides one two three four five sides going n minus two times equal sum angle five three times want solve x missing angle gon na angle plus x total let plus plus plus right angle thats plus x equal subtract get geta hundred fifty degree thats angle right one excuse angle polygon trying solve exterior angle going add exterior angle one going go alright plus plus plus plus plus x angle equal thats plus plus x equal subtract see x equal thats angle right next one find measure interior exterior angle decagon meant write regular decagon ill regular decagon meaning angle sides decagon like decade right theres ten year decade theres going ten angle decagon theres couple different ways either use formula could use formula use one going tobe little bit easier since decagon going divided equal exterior decagon degree thing notice see extend side like interior angle exterior theyre going supplementary might little easier see extended side exterior angle interior angle see line linear pair theyre gon na right interior angle would minus thats hundred forty four days use easier use formula formula little bit simpler regular polygon righto kay last one sum interior angle polygon add thousand three hundred forty type polygon one doesnt specify whether regular say interior angle add two thousand three hundred forty going go formula sum interior angle helpful know memorize formula havent already let see substitute two thousand three hundred minus two times gon na divide sides comes add two sides get equal n gone get higher put gone sides god hope youve enjoying video hope learned something sometimes little know piece thats missing make big difference grade hope video helping subscribe channel take look past video got coming stay tuned talk soon
