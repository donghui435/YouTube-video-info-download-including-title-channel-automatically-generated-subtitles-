hi guy nancy today going talk find vertex parabola first thing need know youve given standard form parabola vertex form parabola say youve given standard form equation parabola squared plus plus standard form like equal x squared plus b x plus c case b c vertex need remember formula b really need b problem b equal times turns positive trip people finding vertex dont know equation remember b set give vertex need remember formula b divided x vertex pair halfway actually hard part take x plug x plug x original equation mean times squared plus times plus plus plus equal know vertex vertex point k gon na look vertex form great cause super easy another form one actually lot easier given form literally pull vertex straight equation vertex form general look like equal times x minus h squared plus need know h k vertex really pattern matching want match h k given minus h general equation minus example h equal k equal vertex problem would h k thats sometimes sign bit going show another one remember vertex form look like given equation instead x plus number inside square need rewrite x minus form would times x minus negative minus negative plus plus see match vertex form h vertex case would x value value k simply positive point vertex k guy hope find vertex parabola like video click like let know
