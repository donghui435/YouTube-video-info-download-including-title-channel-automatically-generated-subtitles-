ear lier mathematics may done probably got familiar idea factor example let arbitrary number number could say number product say two six two times six equal take product six get could say two factor could also say six factor take product thing get could even say form people dont really talk way could think way broke thing could use multiply probably remember ear lier mathematics notion prime factorization break prime case could break six two three two times two times three equal youd say well would prime form prime factorization prime factor sand general idea notion factor thing multiply together get original talking essentially taking number breaking thing multiply together get original number going extend idea algebraic domain start say expression plus four x break product two either two product number expression well one thing might jump write times one plus two x verify like indeed equal two plus four x going distribute two two times one two two times two equal four x plus four x algebra brains often revie wed refer red expression form sometimes people would say two could easily say one plus two x broken thing two let couple well think know told could write way actually figure let another say dont say six let different say six x six x plus three let write six x plus thats interesting one way think break common factor well one six x literally times x want break six divisible six could write six times thing six times five write way see hey factor six essentially reverse distributive property essentially undoing distributive property taking six going end take six end six times take six x take six plus six x plus factor could write six times x plus five verify distributive property distribute six get six x five times six six x something thats little bit interesting might want factor fraction let say situation let get new color let say minus x could write guess could say wan ted factor something encourage pause video try figure ill give hint see factor write way trying factor write first term times one second could write minus times three x thats x three x divided two times three x see factor going times one minus three x another way could thought hey look thats little bit dealing fraction one way think divide divide divided one take divide going three took thats another way think dont know confuse confuse less hopefully give sense factor ing expression another example even abstract thing could say ax plus ay could write form well term could write times x plus sometimes hear people say verify multiply distribute youd left ax plus ay
