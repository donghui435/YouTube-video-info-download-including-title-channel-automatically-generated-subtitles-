multiply multiplying two binomial actually going show two really equivalent ways one might hear classroom kind way might faster really dont know one essentially apply ing something already know kind logical way first way might exposed theyll use something cal led foil let write immediately see whenever someone give new mnemonic memorize something pretty mechanical foil literally stand first outside let write way f l f foil stand first foil stand outside stand inside l stand last reason dont like thing sis year old going remember foil stood going remember multiply binomial let apply foil first say multiply first term binomial multiply times outside part tell us multiply outside term case outside outside inside well inside term finally last term last term times essentially making sure term every term essentially multiplying distributive property twice multiplying times times plus multiplying times give us anyway let multiply get answer times thing times x times x thing square x first time x first multiply x get x squared times term right times x right term times times x finally term blue times arent done yet simplify little bit two like term find new color term x first power x term right something add another way something subtract going something put term squared said would show another way want show distributive property get us without memorize foil distributive property tell us look something times expression multiply times every term expression distribute distribute onto actually let view way could distribute whole thing onto change order since used something left thing swap ped two expression distribute whole thing times term happen take times well thats going times distributed times going add times distributed onto distributive property distribute onto distribute onto distribute onto distribute onto distribute like get times thats right times thats term right times thats term right times term right got exact result got foil foil faster wan ted kind skip step think important know actually works case forget year old faced multiplying binomial remember distributive property
