look similarity mean site site site condition consider two triangle triangle triangle assume vertices vertices p q condition similarity corresponding sides proportion similar b p q equal b c q r equal c p r triangle similar triple condition similarity condition enough us say triangle similar call condition since looking three sides understand example given two triangle sides triangle p q similar know need find ratio corresponding sides two triangle let find b b p q ratio would equal reduced let try finding ratio b c q r b c given q r given us ratio would reduced us two ratio equal find c p ratio say two triangle similar c p r get c p r also equal corresponding sides proportion say triangle similar triangle
