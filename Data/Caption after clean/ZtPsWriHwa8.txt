video gon na talk cal led arithmetic sequence recall sequence listing regular plain old sequence doesnt pattern appear arithmetic sequence going sequence sequence differ constant amount video want give real quick introduction arithmetic sequence video ill talk finding general term sub n also finding sum partial arithmetic series thing gon na determine arithmetic arithmetic gon na give value well talk idea arithmetic series simple notice go would add go would add go add notice well keep know assumedly pattern continue well would certainly call arithmetic sequence every term differ ing constant amount value add get next term gon na positive say value positive second example negative go negative one point seven negative two point seven negative three point seven negative four point seven case every term differ ing subtract one get next term case would say yes arithmetic value equal negative one third example well let testone one point six two point look like weve added point weve added point six oh two point eight two three point three though weve added positive find two different doesnt matter since theyre amount say arithmetic know real thing check sequence arithmetic careful arithmetic last one four third seven third eight well notice could change make fraction could make two one multiply top bottom three hey would get likewise make three nine third go one third seven third eight third like value time get term would say one arithmetic value would equal positive first one yes arithmetic second one arithmetic third one said wasnt fourth one also said arithmetic thats basic idea arithmetic sequence thats finding formula general term sometimes little tricky also sometimes theyll add finitely many term well video ill talk thing
