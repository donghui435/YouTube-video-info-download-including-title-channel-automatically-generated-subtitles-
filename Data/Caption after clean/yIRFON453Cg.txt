welcome video optimization example given demand cost function need find number x maximum profit let stake look two function given us well start demand function demand function telling us price product thats wit hap demand price product based many x notice higher x lower value p going make sense higher supply lower demand lower price product going demand function another way price let take look cost function cost c c equal x plus notice higher x higher cost going make sense produce higher cost going take produce two equation example let take look step need use optimization problem step number one step number find equation maximize minimize go back example need find equation maximize minimize notice question say find number x maximum profit profit need maximize find equation profit well use natural intuition know profit equal total amount money receive selling product minus cost produce product wrote equation profit equal revenue total amount money receive selling product minus cost cost produce product make sense example product sell product received revenue product take dollar cost produce profit would revenue minus cost produce minus would profit could use natural intuition figure find profit equation profit equation trying maximize ready move step number two step number two say equation one variable go back example need profit equation term one variable moment written term revenue cost take look revenue like revenue total amount money receive product sell product times equal revenue would equal equal price product number sold revenue equal price number sold x right let pay attention particular price product try rewrite term x well know demand equation another way price price p equal minus profit equation place price minus written revenue one variable x revenue equal price number sold x exact thing cost let try rewrite cost one variable x cost already given us term x know cost c equal x plus replace cost x plus come revenue cost cost x plus right written profit equation term one variable x profit ill label capital p since running space profit equal times x x plus move next step profit equation little bit first thin gim going distribute distribute x negative positive x times negative equal negative x times equal positive x thing right side equation negative one even though theres one theres imp lied one always negative one positive x equal negative x notice two like term x negative combine minus equal going replace x last least need multiply negative positive equal simplified profit equation much possible written term one variable x ready move step number three step number three find critical value need take derivative equal zero go back example need take derivative profit function set equal zero derivative profit respect x equal derivative negative squared equal negative plus derivative positive x equal plus derivative negative equal zero derivative respect x need set equal zero find critical value thing need solve x easy equation solve first thing going subtract sides left side equation negative cancel left negative equal right side zero minus equal negative get x divide sides negative sides negative left negative cancel left x x equal negative hundred divided equal positive critical value x equal ready move step number four step number four say verify critical value maximum go back example need verify critical value maximum minimum possibly could neither test see min like second derivative test going perform second derivative test right blue first thing going rewrite first derivative equal negative plus second derivative respect tox equal derivative equal negative plus derivative positive equal zero second derivative equal negative right need verify critical value min need plug second derivative plug second derivative notice second derivative constant negative matter value x plug second derivative always going equal negative second derivative negative critical value going maximum critical value indeed maximum good question us find maximum profit critical value maximum right ready answer question number x maximum profit well know x equal maximum answer number produce produce maximum profit hope video gave better idea perform many much different thats made four optimization video aswell links video screen description example use red see example use video much watching see next one
