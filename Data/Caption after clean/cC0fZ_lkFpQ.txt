hi welcome math learned lot geometry far theres one really important geometric shape still need shape circle since invention extremely important humanity grog make wheel thanks grog fact probably see circle almost everywhere mathematically circle well geometry circle defined set point equidistant distance another single point best way understand mean see single point start let start drawing point equidistant point foot away right let make another point foot away another direction let say let make another one also foot away another direction right let make another right another another another getting tired see whats happening equidistant point add pattern look like circle thats circle defined set point equidistant center point course usually dont see set point infinitely many form continuous let learn part make circle first original point star ted thats cal led center origin circle next distance used draw equidistant point form distance cal led radius radius important distance center circle point perimeter circle even though circle one radius dimension draw many radius want usually see one radius line drawn since length matter draw another important circle dimension cal led diameter diameter distance across circle start one point circle draw line straight center side distance diameter see diameter really two radius drawn exactly opposite circle diameter always exactly twice long radius equidistant point drew combine form perimeter circle remember perimeter distance way around shape circle special shape perimeter circle get special name cal led circumference circumference distance way around circle going learn calculate circumference circle next video well also learn calculate area circle learn thing first need learn make pie sorry grog kind pie math word pi p special number fact special get symbol letter symbol number pi pi number dont write like use special symbol thats good question ill get minute first let learn pi really seeing circle turns pi really sure ratio watch video basically ratio relationship two written like fraction pi ratio two different distance circle ratio distance around circle distance across circle call two circumference diameter pi relationship circumference diameter see minute pi ratio number circle matter big number whats value pi well figure look two big one small going imagine circle diameter flexible like piece string wrap around outside edge circumference circle start top wrap diameter around circumference see diameter enough go way around let get another diameter keep going first diameter two diameter still enough go way around look like going need get third diameter keep close three diameter almost enough look like going need little bit form full circumference little bit turns mean take diameter equal one circumference circle big value pi always pi little complicated really pi rounded two decimal place sand actually round pi type number thats cal led irrational irrational number decimal never end never repeat grog confused yes irrational seeing decimal help understand precise pi decimal keep going forever without amazing huh good news saying pi usually close enough math thats really need memorize thats use symbol pi could write pi two decimal could write decimal place accurate could write hundred decimal place super accurate could use symbol represent true value infinitely video weve learned circle weve learned important part center radius diameter circumference weve also learned special number cal led pipi ratio circle circumference diameter value matter size circle next video circle going learn use number pi find circumference area circle even though much math actually practice section dont lots practice problem next section make thanks watching math antic ill see ya next grog good math learn
