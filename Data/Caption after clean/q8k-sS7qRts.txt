bam r let proof k tangent squared x secant x equal secant minus cosine going deal power left hand side going prove identity cant get cant divide way cant square root away require work sides identity dont know point remember proof five step follow right order get right answer going try something dont like try something else maybe proof quick er maybe proof quick er know two sides match long algebra correct way see one one tangent squared x dont see tangent function right hand side going take tangent squared x one plus tangent squared x equal secant squared x going use identity rewrite numerator going bring one side going write tangent squared x equal secant squared x minus first step may write sine cosine one cosine start might perfectly fantastic maybe going good proof done first looking problem still degree degree one dont see way cancel ing anything remember cancel term student like something like cant cancel cancel ing secant secant would like saying k might watching could cancel common thing top bottom fraction common term cancel four divided four equal one last time checked one plus nine ten equal really four plus nine four four plus none thirteen denominator four last time checked thirteen four equal ten cannot cancel term hear paying attention k good multiplication could cancel factor cancel term going cancel away else going well one term fraction bar grouping symbol one term left two term right take fraction break two part well two term numerator subtraction two fraction common denominator dont believe minus common denominator dont subtract write common denominator yeah going going take secant square minus one split term give one fraction common denominator secant got secant squared x secant minus one secant getting excited cancel secant times secant secant secant times secant two thing sare together factor term one secant bottom cancel one two secant top divide like bases subtract exponent well get secant minus one secant reciprocal function yeah right cosine x match whoo alright going next one oki e next proof going look next identity going try verify cosine negative theta one plus sine negative equal secant theta plus tangent theta well particular proof identity going verify angle measure sare close equal instead theta negative theta opposite angle need talk chapter concept book might remember previous video watching sequence need discuss idea even odd function cosine cosine axis fall direction cosine graph symmetric axis mean put opposite x get value cosine even function sure even function odd need go back review concept already covered class cosine angle equal cosine opposite angle even function cosine negative theta equal cosine theta cosine symmetric axis even sine symmetric axis sine origin symmetry take look book parent function sine turn book degree know difference upside besides nothing sine odd function mean plug opposite angle want write sine theta negative theta going plug opposite angle plug opposite value get opposite answer sine negative theta going opposite sine positive theta plug opposite value going get opposite answer alright got two sides matching going stop working left hand side sine cosine building block trig function nothing else well guess could going try simplify instead making complicated going write secant tangent term sine cosine hopefully something nice happen let see secant one cosine theta oh got laugh joke terrible tangent sine cosine worse really joke common denominator side got one plus sine theta cosine well sides building block trig core function wow dont know yeah k like idea got one minus right side side got one minus sine bottom fraction left side identity let start working right side got room think going need step thank suggestion want one minus sine fraction said cannot move thing one side equation excuse identity going multiply sides one minus sine theta would moving one side going multiply fraction one funny looking one going multiply one minus sine theta one minus sine theta one right see one right k happen well happen going one times one one times negative sine positive sine times one positive sine times negative sine difference square pattern distribute going get times going get positive sine negative sine going cancel positive sine negative sine negative sine squared theta cosine theta times one minus sine theta going distribute stuff together need power two showing going kind cancel ing make match left hand side leave denominator form going save work numerator full sine function numerator cosine going get match dont get top trig function first theorem say sine squared plus cosine squared equal one angle probably leaving theta say take one minus sine squared theta substitute first identity one minus sine square theta equal cosine squared theta look one term top cosine one term top cosine squared one minus sine bottom one minus bottom close oh cancel factor one bottom factor something else added cosine bottom going cancel one two cosine top look cosine theta one minus sine theta match match yeah alright let another one love stuff try different substitution sudden algebra start arent getting close answer got one plus cosecant theta secant theta minus cotangent theta equal cosine lot going left hand side work way tree land come trunk dont make complicated dont try make one term somehow add cotangent secant simple cosine function start left figure cosine dont cosecant secant cotangent going rewrite left hand side term sine cosine right bat one plus one sine theta one cosine theta minus cotangent cosine sine look worse going cleaning first fraction see anything nice happen second fraction done going find common denominator one sine going sine going multiply sine theta top bottom common denominator going sine theta plus one sine cosine theta minus cosine theta sine theta bottom fraction going get going get going sit going get sine theta plus one sine cosine got one cosine theta sorry going get sine theta plus one times cosine sine second fraction already sine denominator look got sine theta plus one times cosine minus cosine sine final nothing cosine left take cosine two term going come together one big fraction let write like since common denominator sine two term cosine take cosine factor sine plus one times cosine cosine going sine theta plus one take cosine term cosine divided cosine one minus one sine well running room also almost done one minus one zero cosine times sine sine theta almost made mistake finish time bam cancel get cosine theta hurry making couple mistake let fill back bam cosine theta left equal cosine theta right r go homework
