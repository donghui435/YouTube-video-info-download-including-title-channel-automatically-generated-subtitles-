screen shot khan academy unit whole point get familiar unit circle definition extension traditional definition reason math world define sine cosine angle degree actual negative let figure sine degree dot thats sitting unit circle circle radius let hit dot make angle degree swith positive let see thats degree degree see angle measure right degree get us halfway get us way around little bit need figure sine unit circle definition sine value angle measure weve made angle measure weve gone degree counterclockwise positive x axis get point right value negative sine ked cosine would give x value point dot right value negative check answer another one get let see sine negative going go negative angle negative degree sand sine want look point negative answer keep maybe well see cosine soon enough sine degree looking right sine value negative check another one sine piso dont see little degree sign see pi right thats angle radian relative positive counterclockwise direction care sine value point sitting unit one thing bear mention exact square root square root write decimal would continue forever without actually approximation sake module really want make comfortable unit circle maybe tool really type approximate number dont exact number square root rounded nearest thousand check another one sine sine going keep get cosine let cosine pi radian swell pi completely going around unit circle let go way around get back weve gone around pi back cosine x value point x value point x value point wan ted sine pi would get value right check one maybe well see another cosine cosine cosine piso thats going little want x value value x value answer done
