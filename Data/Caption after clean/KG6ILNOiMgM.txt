hi rob welcome math antic sin video going learn decimal place value name suggest related regular place value sure watch video already previous video learned count different digit sand number place represent different sized example count apple used different number place counting group ten group digit represent two represent three thirty represent five pretty amazing system think different combination count number zero way apple amazing one little problem number system whole apple place value video learned count whole amount call whole set get start count thing besides whole amount possible part something part apple mean amount might one apple two could also something like one half apple show base number system handle situation like answer decimal place way extending base number system represent amount whole place like regular number place except instead count group use count part fraction see base system extended decimal look pattern number place saw last video star ted number place counting thing one time hit limit counting used another number place left side counting group combining two number place could count zero way count beyond used another number place left side counting group place axed added place counting group group see pattern time added new number place left previous one time group ten times previous group since amount number place represent get bigger bigger go left make sense number place counting smaller amount like part something less need go right side decimal place like whole number place go forever left counting bigger bigger decimal number place go forever right counting smaller smaller part number place go forever either direction know place look invisible know digit goes place ah excellent question problem number place extend whole number place extended one direction left knew place farthest right always place know number place extend direction need new way tell place need point place always start use special symbol cal led decimal point united look like period basically decimal point act separator separates number place used counting whole value left side decimal point number place used count fractional value right side decimal point see decimal point every number decimal number like whole number need show decimal point safe assume digit farthest right place course could still show decimal point wan ted since always immediately right place decimal need separate whole number number decimal call decimal number decimal point help us quickly recognize digit place example see sequence like point tell right away digit place immediately left decimal point mean place hundred right decimal point know must decimal number place decimal number place value count well looking back number place pattern see time move left new number place count amount ten times bigger previous place time move right place count amount ten times smaller previous place since place count number place right count amount ten times smaller one amount ten times smaller one cal led tenth amount get take one whole like one whole apple divide ten equal part keeping one call fraction fraction written special notation two line number bottom tell may equal part whole amount divided top number tell many part fraction one tenth written like one ten getting back apple counting previously could count whole number place counting tenth count tenth apple use place tenth place together count amount whole number see works let start counting one whole apple mean place tenth place let start tenth tenth count increase digit tenth place one tenth two tenth three tenth pause second notice something important see tenth apple one half apple exactly half fraction simplified apple one half cool huh anyway back tenth tenth snow one whole apple also apple tenth place axed digit high count think happen add one tenth yep ten tenth combine form one whole apple cause place digit increase whole apple even though one made slice amount still equal one whole see decimal help us count whole amount decimal number place tenth place allow us count want count amount tenth crunch decimal number place keep going right time count amount ten times smaller previous amount tenth place count fraction tenth one next place count amount one tenth tenth tenth cal led one hundredth fraction get take tenth divide ten equal part sit small fraction cal led hundredth fraction get take whole divide fraction form look like like tenth could used represent amount used represent amount tenth sand like combined tenth equal one combine hundredth equal decimal number place keep going like next number place represent fraction one tenth small fraction cal led one thousandth would take make one whole next place times smaller cal led place millionth place see truly amazing number system represent whole number amount matter big bigger bigger number place left also represent amount whole amount fraction imaginable decimal number place right truly amazing fact make head hurt could daw gone pot wear head time know decimal place work let talk briefly show place value write decimal expanded digit value determined place tenth stand written fraction tenth place stand tenth place stand like tenth place stand place value hundredth place stand place value thousandth place stand place value knowing help us write decimal expanded like one saw ear lier expanded form whole number part easy learned last video need add fraction decimal since tenth place stand need add fraction expanded form also digit hundredth place stand also need add fraction expanded basic decimal number still learn see decimal number place lot fraction may learned much yet learn fraction help decimal number place make even sense several math antic video fraction help video cal led converting fraction main thing know base number system works really important since used time math always thanks watching math antic l l see ya next time learn
