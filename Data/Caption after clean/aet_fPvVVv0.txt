alright example guy swill working basically us solve basically graph linear separately going decide graph slope intercept form go ahead going solve case sorry x x plus equal x minus equal reason equal rather graph ing especially slope intercept form think term equal x plus band gon na sneeze love every single time say gon na say dont sneeze right set equation rewrite slope intercept form subtract get equal negative plus important us understand actually inequality left know change subtract negative less negative plus notice ladies gentle men going dividing negative whenever divide flip inequality symbol positive identify slope intercept axis go slope negative always want write fraction thats gon na bedown notice less gon na dashed go ahead go one one intercept negative point slope gon na go notice thats greater dashed line right ladies gentle men going tobe looking apply ing k need point help us shade best point always pick long plug x equation remember point therefore less true false equation since thats true equation going shade towards test point go trap one greater negative true false true gon na shade towards true point see region true region true going shade
