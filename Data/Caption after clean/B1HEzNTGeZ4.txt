hi rob welcome math antic sin lesson gon na learn three important math concept mean median mode math often deal data set data set often collection group may result scientific measurement survey data collection example might record age member family data might measure weight pet list data data set fairly small easy understand could much bigger data set sa really big data set might contain cost every item store top speed every land mammal brightness galaxy data set would contain lot different number sand look big data set one would pretty hard make sense say much besides well lot mean median mode really help us three different data give us useful easy understand information data set see big picture understand data mean world live pretty useful huh let learn property really find calculate particular data set let start mean may ever hear something cal led mean l l bet v e hear average v e got good news mean mean average mean average two different term exact property data mean average extremely useful property understand let look simple data set contain visual aid let also represent stack height correspond eight three two six right since different stack block different rearrange block goal making stack word stack could exact amount would amount well bit trial error l l see enough block stack total mean mean average original data set would greater less amount could made would become concept mean value get could smooth flatten different data value one consistent value way use math calculate mean data set would inconvenient always use stack block got easier learn mathematical procedure calculating mean let start block time instead trial use systematic way make stack height way involve clever combination addition division know want end stack number block right first let add like block one big counting block show us total divide number stack equal stack total equal stack mean l l since divided equal math procedure use find mean data two simple add set divide total get many added answer get mean data set let use procedure find mean age member fine looking family add calculator hand like total age need divide total number age added divided mean age member family alright mean median middle data number split data set two equally sized group halves one half contain member greater equal median half contain member less equal median sometimes finding median data set easy sometimes hard finding middle value data member order least vice data set lot number sit might take lot work put right order already make thing easier let start really basic data set n order pretty easy see put data set order least value switching data set finding median middle data set easy exactly middle almost seem easy n get harder try harder problem want point sometimes mean median data set number sometimes case simple data set median mean also see rearrange follow procedure learned calculate mean first data set found mean determined mean data set median well median middle since data set already order least easy see middle since split member two equal data set mean median find median set need make sure order identify member exactly middle making sure equal number member either side tokay far good may wondering data set n obvious middle member set v e found median far odd number even number data set n member middle split set two equally sized case actually use learned mean help us data set even number member find median need take middle two calculate mean average two basically number would exactly half way two middle number sand number median example set need take middle two find mean dividing plus equal divided median data set though number n actually member data median represent middle data set split member two equally sized know difference mean median mode data set world mean well mode technical word value data set occur often data set v e seen even mode none data value ever repeated data set member value repeated rearrange see one two three mode data set value occur often frequently would since three snow get confused number repeater times mode number repeated often many times repeated member data set occur also possible data set one mode example data set like set number repeated twice number mean tie title mode set two mode know mean median mode data set put new information use one final real world example suppose guy make sell custom electric table showing many guitar sold month find mean median mode data set first find mean need add number guitar sold month addition hand use calculator want way careful since lot add want make mistake answer get total sold whole year get mean sold month need divide total number month divided mean average find median data set going rearrange data point order figure middle value better since even number member set choose middle number going pick middle two find mean middle since equal number data value either side need take mean easy plus equal divided median number guitar sold mean half month sold half month sold less let identify mode data set let two data three look like frequent number mode data result occur red often alright basic mean median mode three really useful data set know find sometimes part mean median mode remember ing remember mean mean average median middle mode start remind number occur often remember get good math need watch video need practice sure try finding mean median mode always thank watching math antic l l see ya next time learn
