welcome another video make sense transcendental considered tough video attempt popularization know even get really convincing argument particular number transcendental let alone anything beyond best shot giving introduction transcendental depth time accessible anybody bit common sense introduction powered remarkably core theory infinite set great mathematician cantor among probably familiar construction sure even couple pleasant plot twist wont see coming stick around please end let know worked didnt quick transcendental care go talk video first instance mean real usual ill often represent standard set number line integer rational expressed fraction integer fact long time people believe rational actually quite natural think multiple multiple get narrowly spaced wish pretty easy see matter tiny interval pick number line always infinitely many rational start really reason suspect exist irrational cannot written fraction course probably know root golden ratio two irrational well fraction algebraic come naturally algebra solution integer coefficient example fraction solution linear equation root one two quadratic equation randomly picked polynomial equation bottom got one real solution approximately minus one point zero six one algebraic number amazing example like real rational form algebraic structure cal led field also exception written radical expression plus minus times divided like algebraic hand algebraic cannot written algebraic number shave really quite miraculous obvious definitely worth one two think case natural question ask whether algebraic word whether transcendental transcend world let warm truly ingenious construction irrational number written fraction start grid made possible pair get like well apart fraction also get nonsense fraction denominator well something first glance may seem impossible make list every rational number exactly ingenious trick possible simply walk along spiral right go rational number first time come across start thats number move divided make first rational number list next second number list forget next theres zero listed move one weve also got already skipping ahead next number seen yet rational know number shave two decimal expansion one ending tail example also written actually seem vast majority people familiar fact majority aware basic fact really violently opposed dont believe even areal eye opener recommend browsing five primary school whenever choice two different decimal one list use decimal expansion highlight infinite diagonal alright diagonal straightaway write number irrational make copy diagonal change circle change new number get way differ every number list one position example differ sixth number list sixth digit differ fifth number fifth digit soon mean new number really different listed right weve listed rational therefore new number irrational fact made neat construction possible rational number scan listed like infinite set listed like countably infinite part infinite list enumerate countably infinite set natural also sense exactly many natural element countably infinite set think moment listing like many natural first time dont really amazing anyway give countably infinite listable set make outside set nifty construction method often thing ill show algebraic like rational countably infinite mean party time use cantor construct number algebraic number transcendental important ingredient listing fact quadratic equation two solution sand degree equation like one bottom solution quick sketch list algebraic weve already listed fraction linear equation integer coefficient b dont much detail method listing algebraic pretty arbitrary lots lots different ways listing algebraic number sin fact hard make method life ever depend know might happen weve listed rational number swell list quadratic irrational solution three integer coefficient sa b c like systematically grid hereof integer pair inside cycle fraction use grid integer triple b c cycle possible every quadratic equation come across way add among solution new list neither fraction therefore already part first list quadratically rational weve already seen second process way list quadratic irrational root golden ratio example repeat process cubic irrational compact together grid contain every algebraic number exactly weve got final nifty trick string grid like simply list come across walking along blue path said one way list infinitely many translate one chosen transcendental number start like transcendental number end usefulness trick use figure many transcendental trick let us real number outside countably infinite set also countably infinite sense well obviously countable would produce real number outside set real well thats obviously possible would really transcendental number anyway possible construct real number outside real since possible mean listed form uncountably infinite set sink second uncountably infinite thats obviously alar ger infinity countably infinity right real uncountably infinite countably infinite transcendental countably infinite uncountably infinite well since complement countably infinite set algebraic uncountably infinite set real number sit uncountably infinite right actually chance show comment said far see go anyway let show something strong er want show countably infinite set rational algebraic vanishingly small compare uncountably infinite set like real transcendental nice argument case rational ill label rational natural list rational number get next get take segment length put number line centered number half remain ing interval put line centered number weve done encase rational set length mean made rigorous branch math cal led measure theory set rational length measure less whole construction still works start outwith shorter segment chop since make small conclusion rational length measure sense even although think theyre well course true countably infinite set like algebraic every countably infinite set measure thats pretty strange conclusion think stranger thing weve seen far like set algebraic set natural also restrict attention finite interval pick random number inside interval paradoxical precise sense zero chance algebraic number whats saying bepretty certain picked transcendental number like pi e well since almost transcendental would expect pi e transcendental thats actually true turns super tough really beyond video like fun proof super dense mathematical pain mention proving pi transcendental resolved problem already puzzled ancient transcendental squaring circle impossible given circle impossible construct square area ideal mathematical ruler compass anyway since even getting proof transcendence pi e number really reach whats next best thing aim well dot transcendental number made sort dot make sense context hand would great able display decimal number simple pattern show number transcendental discovered great preceding cantor bill number really ocean zero swith isolated island th since number arbitrary length clearly therefore irrational number one proven transcendental usually port rayed transcendental number whose transcendence easiest prove think way pinpoint specific transcendental number prove transcendence sho wed video definitely much easier explain understand proof transcendence constant said original main aim video come proof transcendence constant actually put together proof think deserve video sometime today hope video usual let know comment work
