told quadrilateral rhombus want us prove diagonal sare perpendicular c perpendicular let think everything know rhombus first rhombus special case parallelogram parallelogram opposite sides parallel side parallel side two sides parallel rhombus opposite sides parallel parallelogram also equal length side equal side equal side equal side right theres interesting know diagonal parallelogram know rhomb way around necessarily true know parallelogram rhombus parallelogram diagonal bisect example let label point center let label point ewe know ae going equal put two slash es right also know e b going equal know someone rhombus based weve proven need prove c perpendicular interesting way prove look eyeball ing show triangle congruent triangle two angle right correspond theyll supplementary theyll let prove first thing see side side side side side see triangle let write new color see triangle congruent triangle know congruency side side side side side side know know corresponding angle congruent particular know angle ae bis going congruent angle corresponding angle congruent angle right going equal angle also know supplementary let write way theyre congruent supplementary two going measure need add two thing thing add degree tell meso tell measure angle ae bis equal measure angle ce b must equal measure supplementary right angle right angle obviously right angle angle vertical angle thats going right angle right angle going vertical angle see diagonal intersect angle weve proved interesting parallelogram diagonal bisect rhombus sides equal weve shown bisect theyre perpendicular bisector
