professor really galactic concentrator k hold right spot take power comes black hole cent galaxy focus upon give eternal beauty intelligence good stuff dont tell anybody else hi going talk topology twisted toroid little frightening brad professor right going simple bagel familiar know dont eat bagel dry basically slice right kind cut open put cream cheese mathematician torus anything smooth shape one hole thats cal led torus mathematician smoothly deform interestingly enough take coffee cup handle like even though big void still torus mathematician know shape important connectivity something one tunnel one handle essentially genus one surface call torus cut bagel get basically getting two tor one individually even though shape different know still essentially one ring one handle one hole still torus kind crazy rather slicing one nice plane essentially start stabbing torus like go around perimeter rotate knife around carefully kind cutting rotating knife way around side doughnut still fall apart two individual piece brad two piece professor professor two separate piece theyre linked individually still tor theyre still essentially ring one handle hold one one fall floor great advantage eating train kind shaking theres another benefit compare surface compare surface surface actually bigger mean put cream cheese bagel weve put back together make much juice r bagel topological mathematician theyre two tor topology actually sliding surface one another knot theoretician talking knot links different two ring linked whereas two linked separate move apart separate two thing geometry invention geometry actually due ush io well known stone sculptor japan well known well known particular country first met conference art mathematics san conference carve really large three foot diameter granite torus perfect shape like conference drilling sequence couple hundred hole spiral fashion granite doughnut like sliced bagel case nice hole diameter hole diameter diameter rim take two apart come apart much nicely rattle put configuration see locking nicely two ring essentially left sculpture look something like yeah wan ted better understand saw understood felt one hand manipulate really dont know went home within one month made object fused deposition model ling machine know sturdy rapid machine built little bit apart wouldnt touch particular shape theres kind filler material would gap build filler material easily wrench thing apart clean surface filler material get really perfect replica object finally understand going two inter linked could somehow get three inter linked think suddenly came obvious well take different kind knife kind like know straight knife sort rotate around middle blade go around torus instead take knife like essentially three sort half coming together middle slowly rotate knife push forward along rim torus going around torus make sure exactly degree kind important way get see spiral cut dont know expect kind shake loose brad thats brilliant professor see three piece inter linked course three used four could put degree add fourth one basically two cut knife one going around way one going around way either case would still turn whole contraption full degree every piece material wind around torus connect back well would get probably something four ring order make visible gave one round doughnut shape cross section basically made square cross section still torus fact rigid flat face doesnt matter cut yes indeed get something four intertwine ring immediately ask five well six nice one start hexagon cross section perfectly regular hexagon cut hexagon say three diameter one piece small triangle triangle perfectly equilateral see perfectly equilateral cross section six essentially form hexagon make shape cutting apart yeah get six ring make even intriguing kind potential sculpture might make even harder puzzle thats stopped tried build one k like weve seen rotating knife full degree go around doughnut well wrong rotate knife degree well somehow doesnt want come apart look still together seem like one band actually band goes around loop twice seem somewhat intertwine brad one continuous piece bread professor one continuous piece bread little harder know cram cream cheese look sculpture ush io made kind shape much beautiful much regular exaggerated done sculpture see basically doughnut get one groove spiral around goes inside really would like make really giant sculpture would awesome sculpture like could step inside see reflected different part inner space let focus inner space taken away torus cut something thing cut actually band brad aa ah professor ah whats band oh let see take belt right wrap belt around know ordinary way close belt cylinder give belt degree twist dull side get shiny side connect way band whats special band start hi king shiny side go around go around go around go around suddenly ending side stepped one side band without going edge going around loop thats span thats course famous structure already might want rotate knife different happen rotate three times fast goes around swing three times degree get brad wow professor weve taken space make three flip call space certainly sent picture ush io ked whether would carve one far done yet think one days might come create big stone sculpture particular shape brad look like kind propeller something one side look like front plane something professor yeah could head tunnel boring machine going imitate machinery noise dont know really galactic concentrator k hold right spot take power comes black hole cent galaxy focus upon give eternal beauty intelligence good stuff dont tell anybody else laugh professor yeah first one crazy good know architect fascinated concept something obviously build house
