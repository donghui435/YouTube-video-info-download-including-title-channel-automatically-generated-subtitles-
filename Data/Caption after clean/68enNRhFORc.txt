right video want talk deter mining whether trig function odd even neither crawl say function even symmetric axis equation f negative f x odd say asymmetric origin symmetric origin say odd say f negative x equal negative f x well second let talk know sine cosine tangent cotangent secant cosecant let first think graph sine cosine well little bit cosine know cosine symmetric axis mean even mean term definition say say cosine negative x gon na equal cosine x thats equation cosine well get little equation cosine negative x equal cosine x right know think sine x well sine x definitely odd symmetric origin term definition would say sine negative x equal negative sine x thats get say sine negative x equal negative sine x know kind generic even odd requirement sine cosine well hey figure suppose let tangent first let function tangent x tangent sine x cosine x let use even odd equation well plug negative x give us tangent negative x thats going thing sine negative x cosine negative x well know sine negative x going negative sine x cosine negative x said cosine x well thats going give us negative tangent x say fact hey got negative thing star ted say tangent simply going odd function make sense think graph tangent x graph tangent x graph one little period negative pi two positive pi two like odd gon na true know way use cotangent well cotangent x going cosine x sine x way f negative x get cotangent negative x would cosine negative x sine negative x well already said cosine negative x cosine x well get negative sine x cosine sine cotangent well get negative cotangent x thats negative function star ted negative original function cotangent x simply say cotangent x going odd function way way secant cosecant know pretty easy see know theyll exact type symmetry sine cosine secant x thats cosine x call function f x well f negative x would cosine negative x already said thats gon na give us cosine x secant x original function f x say secant gon na even function last least cosecant x thats sine x f negative x would well cosecant negative x going sine negative x said sine negative x negative sine x get negative sine x going negative cosecant thats negative original function f x tell us function simply odd thrilling calculation remember definition even odd know original go original definition even odd long remember sine cosine moral story know dont remember even graph say function always sort know derive stuff rather quickly
