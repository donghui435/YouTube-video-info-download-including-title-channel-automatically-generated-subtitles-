hi welcome math antic sin last video learned easy add subtract fraction bottom number call like often l l ked add subtract fraction different bottom unlike fraction sand learned way change fraction bottom number alright change two unlike fraction two like fraction show get fraction common denominator answer need use equivalent fraction remember equivalent fraction right fraction value use different top bottom represent one half different number swell whenever two unlike fraction need add could find equivalent fraction use instead new equivalent fraction bottom set two like fraction could add find equivalent fraction common denominator bottom number well two main ways video gon na learn first way like call way finding easiest common denominator next video l l talk another method may already hear cal led finding least common denominator easiest common denominator method work well even though easy method might sound little complicated first worry l l make lot sense v e seen example sin method common denominator always going product bottom number sin word number get bottom together basically going take two different bottom make two different whole fraction going move whole fraction opposite sides multiply unlike give us two new equivalent fraction bottom add subtract let try couple example see method action let add fraction like fraction different bottom going change common denominator product bottom change multiplying fraction whole fraction first whole fraction going second fraction denominator second whole fraction going first fraction denominator next multiply starting first fraction top bottom first fraction become second top bottom second fraction become add procedure like fraction add top keep bottom number mean answer plus pretty easy huh alright let see one example method let add fraction common denominator problem going get multiply denominator together l l multiply whole fraction l l multiply whole fraction multiplication times give us bottom top first fraction top second fraction like fraction add top keep bottom number plus equal see answer could simplified sure check video mixed simplify ing fraction see could final answer alright first way find common denominator change unlike fraction like fraction add subtract easily remember practice really important math sure exercise section really get han g check next video l l show use different method find call least common denominator thanks watching l l see next time learn
