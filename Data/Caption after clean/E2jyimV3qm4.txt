look triangle triangle measure angle given us measure angle b given us degree along triangle also given triangle e fin triangle given measure angle degree measure angle e degree given data want know e f similar two condition studied similarity triple triple condition since havent provided sides triple condition wont work triple condition three angle one triangle equal three corresponding angle another triangle triangle similar mean enough data know similar let given angle congruent angle angle b congruent angle e know sum angle triangle degree triangle angle plus angle b plus angle c equal three know two angle angle degree angle b degree angle plus angle b degree written degree plus angle c equal degree side get measure angle degree cut measure third angle triangle similarly find measure f triangle measure sanga also equal measure angle basically data two pair corresponding angle could figure similarity condition need two angle congruent similarity cal led double repeat even two pair corresponding angle congruent say triangle similar
