going look three example trinomial problem get one variable floating around trinomial ought first example look three term always look first number sare even least pull else three term dont see fin three term look like theres gon na factor left v squared v f f squared factor whether recognize perfect square trinomial maybe see maybe dont dont see look approach kind like bottom dont worry variable right let suppose f smart theyre trying get see could like problem similar done past actual problem ignore f writing let worry fright suppose got rid f f squared factor recognize perfect square trinomial dont worry let take times product sum equal two work times give us give us done past come back write v v come back number made disappear following bottom simplify v divide v plus bottom therefore v v v let forget beginning still final answer reason trying get see trinomial without f bring f back notice last term f squared could get f square multiplying last two term stuck f right fright f x f squared notice theres f middle well foil check work notice get trinomial check v v thats b square dim two piece v f also v f well theres v f combine like term theres f squared run much get used maybe one variable first time v v first term put f last term let go one step since perfect square final answer times v f squared might take practice almost kind like guess check speak stuck back much become habit like first probably bottom like whoa thats crazy becomes habit thats happen well theres answer one one always look first twenty four thirty nine least pull three outlet see term dim dont weve got v fourth v cube v squared least pull v squared separate stuff leaves us eight v squared plus v b minus three put v squared b squared like said first example used notice bees kind like f v squared v squared f squared b squared v like v f get used seeing set let product negative sum two work negative negative negative snow negative negative gon na negative positive negative thats want use positive times negative give us negative positive minus give us got play around sometimes get workout whether want bring v whatever kind like showing bottom piece back going come back stick b kind like went back stuck f sin ago v minus remember bring simplify v dividing four get three halves dividing two get bring two bring four dont forget bring squared squared two two v plus three stick four v minus one go ahead say minus band multiply stuff back would go right back beginning notice let multiply real quick head v times four v eight v squared plus b b v however want call v b thats going said plus thats v v v b thats get positive v b b times negative b negative b squared squared obviously distribute back make sure get first going case actually jump straight bottom notice x squared squared kind like v squared f squared x middle kind like v air v middle bottom times negative product b negative sum equal negative two work negative positive multiply two get negative add two get come back write x minus x plus computer getting little slow dont forget divide x minus simplify cant simplify bring plus dont want leave answer like need get squared end comeback stick thats one foil back x times x squared x times plus x x plus minus x give negative x negative positive negative squared work yeah take little bit bottom weve quite bit matter sometimes maybe coming back sticking variable end problem well thats video hope hell
