understand symmetry let draw isosceles triangle triangle two sides equal let give easy task need think divide triangle two part match exactly theyre folded along line would divide triangle condition satisfied fold along line part formed match exactly pause video give shot easy sure would got right draw line like condition satisfied yes vertical line triangle two match exactly folded along part right taken left see overlap exactly shape said symmetrical two part match exactly folded along let give another figure draw isosceles triangle way ask question would divide triangle two path match exactly folded along line yes draw horizontal line like get two path match exactly one folded flip overlap exactly see cal led symmetry axis symmetry triangle vertical axis symmetry line vertical one horizontal axis symmetry line horizontal want think next question going ask shape one axis symmetry look two triangle must probably say line divide two part match exactly correct answer one axis symmetry look rectangle two parallel sides equal two parallel sides equal four angle measure degree sit horizontal axis symmetry like one part overlap exactly also vertical symmetry like flip part see perfect overlap rectangle horizontal well vertical line symmetry wait us may wondering diagonal also axis say diagonal like see folding along diagonal give us matching try page notebook try fold along diagonal see part overlap another question figure two axis symmetry yes figure answer example square sides equal four angle right angle sit horizontal well vertical axis symmetry like rectangle square two diagonal also axis symmetry fold along diagonal part match even fold along diagonal two part overlap exactly square four axis symmetry horizontal vertical two diagonal smore four figure like regular hexagon regular hexagon closed figure six equal six equal angle show many axis symmetry regular hexagon pause video try arrive correct let see horizontal vertical obvious two diagonal would also axis symmetry think yes line joining two line joining two also axis symmetry folding figure along line swill give us matching part six circle hand infinite axis symmetry matter draw line passing cent rethe two part formed always fold perfectly along know nature love symmetry best example symmetry nature would human face vertical axis symmetry saw video reflectional symmetry one part kept mirror reflection give us partlet say keep half hexagon side mirror reflection give us half hence cal led reflectional symmetry type symmetry yes cover next session
