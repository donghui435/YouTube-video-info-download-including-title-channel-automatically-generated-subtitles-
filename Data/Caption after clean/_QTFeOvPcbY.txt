want quick argument proof diagonal rhombus perpendicular remember rhombus parallelogram four sides equal fact four sides equal parallelogram make thing clear square could rhombus like comes angle arent square rhombus es angle thats make rhombus equal square rhombus es square snow said let think rhombus think little bit going draw rhombus really kind rotate little bit look sa little bit like diamond notice really drawing orientation little biti orientation rhombus definition four going equal let draw one diagonal sand way drew right kind diamond one diagonal right along horizontal right like triangle top triangle bottom share side side obviously going length triangle sand two sides triangle sare also thing theyre sides actual rhombus three sides top triangle bottom triangle top triangle bottom triangle congruent congruent go back ninth grade geometry youd use theorem prove three sides congruent triangle congruent also mean angle triangle congruent angle opposite side side right congruent corresponding angle triangle angle opposite would thing triangle also isosceles base angle going thats one base angle thats base angle right upside isosceles triangle right side one two also going theyre going isosceles triangle theyre also going congruent triangle snow take altitude actually didnt even talk since actually dont think relevant actually want prove want prove take altitude vertices side right altitude definition going perpendicular isosceles triangle perfectly drop altitude guess could call top unique angle unique vertex isosceles triangle split two symmetric right right triangle essentially mirror image also bisect opposite side altitude fact median triangle could side exact thing going happen bisect ing side right angle essentially combination two altitude really diagonal rhombus right angle diagonal rhombus bisect diagonal rhombus could make exact argument could think isosceles triangle altitude split two symmetric right triangle sit bisect opposite side essentially median triangle isosceles triangle isosceles triangle sides equal side drop altitude two triangle sare going symmetric opposite argument sides equal two diagonal rhombus perpendicular bisect anyway hopefully found useful
