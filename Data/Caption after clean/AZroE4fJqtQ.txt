working function contain following x value ask us function linear nonlinear linear function way tell given change x change always going value example one step change x change always going always going always going value dealing linear function change x x always since x always change always theyre dealing nonlinear function actually show plotting x going different value went youd want divide change change x always constant fact let write something linear change change x always constant example change x sare always right go example change x always going order function linear change needs constant going take divide let see change constant go go go go already see constant didnt go time went go going actually going increasing amount definitely dealing nonlinear function see graph let draw ill rough graph let make vertical axis go way ill little bit granularly could value go axis right theyre obviously exact scale ill let plot first point x x thats right x thats right x right x right finally x right immediately see tracing linear function point would line look something like thats cal led linear function case nonlinear rate increase x going
