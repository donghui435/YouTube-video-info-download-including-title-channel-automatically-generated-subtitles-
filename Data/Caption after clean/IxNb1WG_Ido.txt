hey folk short kind ordinary video today friend mine cam recently got math tattoo something id recommend told team work certain stretch goal something well incentive initial happen shorthand cosecant function trigonometry decided make tattoo certain geometric representation function kind like wordless signature written pure got thinking though earth teach student trigonometric function cosecant secant cotangent occur red theres something kind poetic particular tattoo tattoo artificially painted become permanent core part recipient flesh fact cosecant name function kind artificial construct math trigonometry could well intact without cosecant ever strange artificial permanence convention sand extent education system word cosecant tattoo cam chest tattoo math something reasonable even worthy immortality inception doesnt necessarily hold time goes let actually show picture tattoo chose lot people know geometric representation cosecant whenever angle typically letter theta common trigonometry related corresponding point unit circle radius one centered origin trigonometry student learned distance point circle x axis sine angle distance point axis cosine angle length give really wonderful understanding cosine sine people might learn tangent angle sine divided cosine cotangent way around cosine divided sine relatively learned theres also nice geometric interpretation draw line tangent circle point distance point x axis along tangent tangent angle distance along line point thats cotangent angle give really intuitive feel mean kind imagine tweak ing theta seeing cotangent get smaller tangent get large rand good gut check student working likewise secant defined divided cosine cosecant defined divided sine theta place diagram look point tangent line distance point origin secant angle divided cosine likewise distance tangent line axis origin cosecant angle divided wondering earth thats true notice two similar right triangle small one inside circle triangle whose hypotenuse resting leave check interior angle tip theta angle originally star ted inside circle one triangle si want think ratio length side opposite theta length hypotenuse small triangle length opposite side sine theta hypotenuse radius one define length ratio sine theta divided look triangle side opposite theta radial line length hypotenuse length one claim ing cosecant take reciprocal side see match es fact cosecant theta divided cool right also kind nice tangent secant correspond length somehow go corresponding cosine cotangent cosecant length corresponding spot diagram like might pleasing six separately name practical use trigonometry get sine cosine tangent fact really could define six term sine alone sort thing cosine tangent correspond come frequently enough convenient give cosecant secant cotangent never really come problem way thats convenient write term sine cosine tangent point really word student learn much added utility anything introduce secant cosine cosecant sine mismatch c prefix probably added point confusion class thats prone enough confusion many reason six function separate computer trigonometry maybe sailor astronomer kind engineer youd find value function large chart corded known input output pair sand cant easily plug divided sine degree calculator might actually make sense dedicate column value dedicate name diagram like one mind taking measurement swith sine tangent secant nicely mirrored meaning cosine cotangent cosecant calling cosecant instead divided sine might actually make sense might actually make easier remember mean geometrically times change dand use case trig dont involve chart value diagram like hence cosecant tattoo whose permanence convention result nature general actually think good lesson student learning new piece math whatever level got take moment ask whether learning core flesh math nature looking actually ked onto subject could easily ked completely way go got book recommendation meant primarily dont already listen audio see video sup ported many know provide audio book audio material sand go get one month free trial meaning listen pretty much anything want free today want recommend z en art motorcycle maintenance actually listen right art learning recommend guy end last video zeta function since author art learning actually big fan z en art motorcycle maintenance actually ended listening twice since kind book unusual way neither like fiction nonfiction really philosophical time powerful lesson empathy storytelling whats version hear beautifully read go listen free book might want hope enjoy ill see next video
