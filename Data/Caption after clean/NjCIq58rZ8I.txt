known one mathematician perhaps natural talent man cal led dian mathematician star ted formal training mathematics working alone isolated able come mathematical theorem thing already known new sent mathematician recognize talent invite come show could film ing film come film concentrated one achievement something partition number ways break number take number integer many ways break positive part sand prove serious mathematician going illustrate dup lo say take number four got four dup lo many ways break positive part could start tower four could break right could three one right could two one one could break could one one one one one notice di breaking two two fact five ways break draw could either draw like one two three four three one like two two could two one one one one one one like mathematician actually way seeing picture actually make conclusion partition easier seethe slightly differently draw like row four like row three row one like way around could like last one one one one one slightly different way favorite foot note textbook favorite footnote textbook oh know favorite footnote textbook said want notation read textbook looking upside mirror get say first time want use notation watch video upside mirror let look sequence partition sequence one two three five seven eleven fifteen twenty two thirty forty two like looking partition thats one five partition four thats breaking number four five ways wan ted break number five seven ways get time get something like one hundred many ways break number one hundred going large number going one hundred ninety million five hundred sixty nine thousand two hundred two get really large becomes difficult calculate partition hand wouldnt nice formula help us work formula give number tell many ways break oh fantastic problem decided tackle formula go back particularly pretty show look like gon na draw polynomial partition coefficient sit mean gon na look like one plus gong plus x plus going x squared next going use many ways break two two ways x cube next want many way break three three ways would keep going like x four know many ways break right five ways seven x five looking thing word like notation mean sum want sum cal led partition n times x power n way infinity saw equal equal going use another symbol symbol capital pi mean product mean multiplying thing background three point one four three point one four yeah limited many letter weve got use pi product product one one minus x k yeah weve got k equal infinity weve got something multiplying together equal polynomial way working partition sand used classically want work partition one hundred could use formula like actually calculation particularly easy used computer would want work partition would use formula like amazing intuition mathematician cal led little wood said positive integer personal like utter nightmare infinitely many personal card list terrible let look thing partition si guess something subject looking partition let saya number look like five k plus four number like end four nine four nine fourteen nineteen number like notice something notice number ways breaking divisible five theres fact first example took k equal zero looking zero looking partition alright many ways five ways divisible five great nine k equal one would partition nine thats next step many ways work tell thirty ways hey works divisible five always appear case able show able show couple thing similar well like partition number loo ked like seven k plus five divisible seven partition look like eleven k plus six divisible eleven little fact see pattern seem appear like next one something like thirteen k plus seven divisible thirteen right incorrect pattern doesnt hold found three found formula like thought well thats formula weve got next one doesnt hold dont appear hold eventually fifty year later solve one look like simple thought seventeen thousand three hundred three k plus two three seven divisible thirteen nothing like found seem crazy know formula like every prime theyre nice first three found still big formula wan ted find let look big formula main number partition one four n square root three exponential pi thats traditional pi thats three point one four times square root two n three thats nice closed formula many partition twiddle sign equal mean approximation approximation get better actually getting better better go along sequence one hundred right know one hundred value one hundred put one hundred would ninety nine million two hundred eighty thousand eight hundred right area true value four point six percent maybe best formula getting better better formula gave actually first term series actually become accurate fact becomes able use full formula first five term work value partition two hundred nearest integer actually formula particularly easy calculate value weve calculated far something around one hundred million million twenty massive number number number ways breaking something eleven billion huge number ways reason partition important partition used mathematics shuffling like shuffling pack card alright think shuffle like lots thing math actually shuffle think even physics like shuffling energy know energy get move around right get get conserve underneath math math shuffling math partition
