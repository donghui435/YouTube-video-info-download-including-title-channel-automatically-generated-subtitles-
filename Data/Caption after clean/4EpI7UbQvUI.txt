hello r watching many would know day wearing money shirt would day talking compound money growth compound interest money question si made another video bill shirt used one favorite topic economy went crap went sure last forever video last know long maybe today stocks really high dont know compound growth sometimes economy like decay compound growth formula far money concerned two going work today final amount investment equal p equal starting value times plus r interest almost always work interest percent term percent would number compounding period sin example going take look today going monthly like bank account n equal number continuous compounding always textbook money many money question going compound continuously every single second like bacteria growth nature thing constantly multiplying growth decay set pattern like per day per let take look couple say got dollar sand going get monthly monthly example like saving account give interest every month get account unless pull start grow slowly growing base therefore compound monthly interest comes back monthly grow money going earn interest though bank paying anywhere near much time maybe money stock investment looking long run going attempt make average money year percent year much money going worth going use formula right final amount investment going equal p initial amount plus interest rate written decimal number period year period monthly power example one pretty straight forward question looking final amount long decent scientific calculator able solve without use kind fancy see happen cant math head going divided plus comes yes worked ahead time usually fly course sometimes make little sign error see voice bubble times going need scientific calculator raise power dont want hit times value times raised power remember need exponent multiply get times raised power multiply two together find maintain average year span going year period spending let ting sit year period gain addition interest dont even work need spend make recording economy bad seem like maybe unrealistic value hopefully year hard achieve even three four year ago bank would c would pay percent seem like give anything economy stay way let take look another take look fact want become ten year sin need happen want year allow money grow interest rate need make goal interest rate need achieve interest going compound monthly mean going use equation like first example equal times one plus interest rate number compounding period per year raised n power times variable exponent going need logarithm need scientific calculator first thing going divide sides isolating variable base high exponent divided going rounded actually plus r raise power going able solve r unless get rid power involve raising sides equation power effectively taking root sides equation scientific calculator going complete problem watching lesson hopefully graph ing scientific calculator raising sides power power property multiply together becomes raised power give us equal plus r going subtract sides give us equal r sides get interest rate approximately percent interest rate become ten year span awesome bam moving next problem next example going continuous compound interest going continuous compounding first going try example say want money double continuous compounding mean going use pert formula going attempt make percent money question long going take continuous compounding little unrealistic bank monthly compounding daily compounding want money double continuous compounding percent long going take well matter talking dollar becoming two dollar becoming whatever doubling doubling dont pick easy value continuous compounding going use pert formula doubling doubling doubling becoming make lot happier begin take period time making want whatever initial investment double see dollar amount mention need initial value final value double star ted note approximately rate time period looking variable exponent probably going need logarithm solve equation since base e going use natural log save step need divide going equal e power get rid base e going apply natural log sides natural log two equal natural log e power natural log e going cancel exponent going fall natural log base e course base could pull exponent front logarithm use power property logarithm bring variable exponent thus allow us solve equation however cancel get natural log equal sides excuse time period require going year snow continuous compounding going make money little bit faster monthly compounding going attempt another example going end decimal answer due round error time actually going time going write much see two need worry variable exponent going take natural log sides common log would work power rule becomes natural log equal times log divided times natural log equal get calculator properly little bit round error get approximately compound interest go homework thanks watching help learn math
