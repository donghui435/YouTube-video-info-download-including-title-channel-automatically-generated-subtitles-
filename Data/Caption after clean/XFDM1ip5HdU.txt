take continue next power infinity might seem crazy sense infinite sum equal like strange obviously false first see promise end video make make sense need back walk might feel like discover convergent infinite sum least seem make sense define really mean discover crazy equation stumble upon new form math make sense imagine early mathematician process infinity whatever mean equal imagine define mean add infinitely many thing friend take seriously would feel like frankly idea imagine anything like wrong stuck time give best guess one way successful part might go one day pondering nature distance object matter close two thing seem always brought little bit closer together without touching math want capture paradoxical feeling imagine p lacing two object number line first second march first object towards second step distance cut half keep track object touch es march writing number naturally written slightly longer sum one power temp ted say approach anything able write thing sum contain reciprocal every power hand see geometrically approach want say kind infinite sum thing education formal write statement ridiculous clearly add infinitely many thing human computer physical thing ever could perform task however approach math healthy irreverence stand brave face ridiculousness try make sense nonsense wrote since kind like nature gave exactly dear mathematician go de fining infinite sum well practiced math know finding right definition less generating new thought dissecting old thought go back came fuzzy discovery point actually perform infinitely many operation list list could keep going forever time number came perfectly reasonable finite sum list approach mean distance number get smaller matter distance number also get smaller thinking realize make special get arbitrarily close say matter small desired distance one number write go list long enough eventually fall within tiny tiny distance retrospectively might seem like clear way solidify mean first time endeavor actually incredibly clever pull pen scribble definition mean infinite sum equal number say x mean generate list cutting sum finite point list approach x sense matter small distance choose point list start falling within distance x math never felt like thing thin air trying justify universe gave first place might wonder find general truth infinite sum look made arbitrary decision instance shrinking distance object cutting interval piece size could chosen proportion could instead cut interval piece size cut rightmost piece proportion get even smaller piece size cut tiny piece size similarly see infinity equal fact popularly written friend insist equal approach es smile know infinite sum approach equal mean thing general say cut interval piece size p p represent number cutting piece size p similar proportion get piece size fashion always cutting rightmost piece proportion find always p next power times equal dividing sides get nice formula formula universe weird form nonsense even though way discovered make sense value p right hand side still make sense replace p number except maybe instance plugging equation read forever alternating two equal pretty silly kind like thing could plugging equation read something even seem reasonable one hand rigor would dictate ignore since definition infinite sum apply case list generate cutting sum finite point approach anything mathematician robot let fact something nonsensical stop leave sum another day jump directly monster first clean thing notice get cut sum finite point one less power general add first n get animation hopefully make clear decide humor universe pretend one less power two actually approach prove cleaner add one everything say two approach zero way make sense effect trying make formula general saying make thing general look place made arbitrary choice place turns sneaky sneaky fact took mathematician century find way define distance two rational say line might reasonable way organize notion distance essentially function take two output number far apart could come completely random notion distance away away sort thing want actually use new distance function way use familiar distance function share example distance change shift amount distance away even distance something four used keeping thing general distance two shouldnt change add amount let call property want notion distance well like triangle inequality start worrying let start notion distance could possibly make approach shift invariant first might toil find frame mind feel like utter nonsense enough time bit luck might think organize room think room greater sub room greater greater infinitely many smaller smaller room pretty hard draw infinitely many thing going war four different sizes keep back mind process able go forever think every number lying hierarchy room shift invariance tell us must fall instance far away likewise distance like see room successive number must fall also deduce negative integer must fall example room sub room always smaller smaller room one less power smaller smaller room turn general idea closeness based room actual distance function take drawing literally since make look close far even though shift invariance imply distance away actual process discovery might toil away scribbling many sheet paper idea thing matter deter mining distance two object size room share might come following lying different large yellow room distance large room orange sub room distance orange sub room distance continue like reciprocal two indicate closeness video see reason room rational like fall see prove notion distance many nice expect distance function like triangle inequality say notion distance perfectly legitimate one call fall general family cal led p stand prime number metrics give rise completely new type number neither real complex become central notion modern number theory metric fact sum equal actually make sense genuinely approach parable actually portray historical trajectory nevertheless still think good illustration recurring pattern discovery math first nature hand something ill defined even nonsensical define new concept make fuzzy discovery make sense new concept tend yield genuinely useful math broaden mind traditional notion answer age old question whether math invention discovery personal belief discovery non rigorous truth lead us construction rigorous term useful opening door fuzzy cycle
