find domain f x equal principal square root minus domain function set possible valid input function possible value function look function defined right square root principal square root going defined taking principal square root non negative number minus going defined minus greater equal take square root positive negative sudden principle square root function assuming plain vanilla one real number sit would defined function definition defined minus greater equal could say minus greater equal solve inequality see saying x add sides inequality get let add sides cancel get greater equal plus divide sides positive number dont swap inequality divide sides get x needs greater equal domain set real greater equal greater equal another way saying function defined x greater equal done
