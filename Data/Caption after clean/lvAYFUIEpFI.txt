last video learned little bit circle circle really special case ellipse special case circle always equal distance away center circle ellipse distance center circle always know ellipse look like well sho wed first video look something like mean radius distance center always say centered origin thats origin right see really point ellipse really close origin actually close st well ever get close well get really far away origin thats far going get right circle special case circle scase furthest get origin distance close st get word always exact distance away origin well said let actually go little bit math general standard form ellipse centered origin x squared squared plus squared squared equal b two number si could written c squared mean theyre place give idea mean ellipse question right length radius going squared took square root whatever denominator distance little chart right little graph distance point right since centered origin point x equal equal course point right would point minus comma radius direction would radius right b point would x equal equal b likewise point right would x equal equal minus band way drew kind short fat ellipse also kind tall skinny ellipse short fat ellipse direction short thats cal led minor axis b always forget exact terminology b call semi length semiminor axis word come well whole thing minor axis maybe could call minor diameter whole thing minor diameter cal led minor diameter semi half b length semiminor axis thats b example drew ellipse happen b smaller b would tall skinny ellipse let actually draw one could like could ellipse look something like case sudden b would semimajor axis b would greater would taller let confuse graph much case length think length semimajor axis even call length major radius think make sense call minor radius let example think done example actual make little bit clearer let say show door following say x squared plus equal radius radius x direction squared radius x direction would say equal map wed say b squared us b equal wan ted graph centered origin let draw ellipse first first radius direction radius ellipse going taller going look something like draw axes could x axis radius distance right going distance radius plotted ellipse nothing fancy actually kind hit point home circle special case ellipse learned last video equation circle x squared circle centered origin x squared plus squared equal r squared divide sides r squared would get little algebraic manipulation x squared r squared plus squared r equal case r b semiminor axis r semimajor axis r word distance distance neither short fat tall perfectly thats circle special case let give slightly look lot complicated something might see exam want show say wan ted shift say wan ted shift right instead origin x equal origin x equal way think term term end ill actually draw think might shift right new equation ellipse x minus squared plus equal draw ellipse right would look like want make look fairly similar ellipse would look like five intuition learned little bit circle video said oh well know x minus something mean new origin positive could memorize could always say oh minus origin negative whatever number would positive five know positive would opposite way really think go equal x equal whole term x behave like x term x equal term like x x equal term equal equal five like x equal squared equal equal either positive minus really want give intuition let say wan ted shift equation two new ellipse look something like lot times learned conic true function shift thing shift way shift graph right five replace x x minus shift two would replace plus let draw new ellipse first new ellipse going look something like shifting yellow ellipse two equation shift well x still x minus squared plus plus equal reason know minus whole term equal minus term behave way term equal minus get point curve right actually one point kind view part kind maximum width point ellipse equal equal sorry equal minus minus thats put equal minus whole term like dont want make kind wrap sometimes might see something like graph following minus plus x plus squared equal first thing could say k like standard ellipse squared plus x equal one like origin origin would would point x minus graph radius direction squared equal radius x direction squared equal x radius actually going little bit fat ellipse actually let draw axes first let draw like thats vertical axis center minus minus go one thats center x direction x term x radius ellipse go three direction wide st point direction direction go go thats draw ellipse would look best little bit fatter tall thats x radius distance right distance right distance right distance right could figure point wont right sake time right point minus go three add x direction point comma would take three away x direction would minus comma could figure might good exercise anyway thats little bit future video well really hairy problem simplify form know definitely ellipse
