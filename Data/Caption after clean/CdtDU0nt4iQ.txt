thing know ladies place value number like thirty four thousand seven hundred need know place four place decimal nine tenth place one place right decimal cal led place eight hundredth place seven place six place five hundred thousandth place ladies gentle men go either direction infinity common see math classes right let start problem number one nine tenth remember tenth place one right decimal write result nine yeah right could write nine tenth without zero place write zero place either way result ladies nine tenth written either way result thats answer thats answer either way fine doesnt matter next going looking ladies seven hundred forty three hundredth place going right decimal going ensure three two place decimal mean decimal lie four thats seven forty know three place right decimal denominator hundred place right decimal thats answer ladies like one cand mixed number seven three already know seven left decimal thats whole number remember two place right decimal mean

thousand place three place decimal mean si need zero four seven make sure seven remains three place decimal answer right negative tenth place one place decimal also notice negative value problem start negative going end ill negative value need make sure one last digit going one place decimal decimal end negative result thats take care let move right next problem two fifth two ways two fifth decimal ladies gentle men first way works every single time divide denominator show five go two division ill show decimal right since dont value two mean decimal two add need solve gon na go ahead bring decimal goes goes four times terminate answer going thats four tenth ladies give result fifth two fifth written decimal another way convert two fifth decimal take two fifth try see make five power mean power like first power power thousand forth know five easily ten multiplying times two following since multiply times get ill multiply numerator well end tenth well gentle men simply written four change fraction denominator thats power easily translate decimal notation thats two ways solve ladies gentle men two fifth decimal would four tenth remember zero front decimal choose zero front decimal theyre answer right let look convert anion decimal long division ill going showing decimal know goes zero times know go ninety four times times right going subtract ill goes five times answer ladies gentle men hundredth result thats going answer thats way get x x power know times easily convert power multiplying times ill multiplying well times simply remember hundred place decimal go ahead write decimal right behind thats hundredth like two different method got problem ladies onto next problem problem see two weve learned thus far take hundredth start long division divisor dividend going add couple bring decimal know goes zero times zero times times times subtract ing ill goes thousand five times like mean innocent zero know result going thousandth thats answer right thats long division convert seven two hundred decimal also following take hundredth knowing convert easily knowing five get thousand ill multiply five well seven times five thirty five end thousandth written thousand need five three place answer right two different method got result done looking ladies gentle men gon na use long division solve problem ill four divisor going three right went ahead added couple case four goes three zero times four goes thirty seven times well subtract ill bring two goes many times exactly times answer hundredth like decimal notation working problem different way go ahead convert decimal power easily become know give ill multiplying numerator also multiplying straight across hundred mean needs two place decimal decimal done thats ladies thats result thats done part number three ladies gentle men could definitely use long division solve problem show divisor going showing decimal dont know need decimal goes goes however times ill ill bring seven times well ill zero goes many times exactly times evenly therefore end find thousand thats answer problem number three ladies thinking well r wit way convert three eighth decimal without long division right definitely convert three eighth ten let check gon na start gon na end thousand get multiplying multiply numerator times result three hundred seventy five thousandth needs decimal ill end upwith three hundred answer thats two method order get result ten denominator ten one hundred thousand thousand matter use long division simply divide denominator give result every time go ahead move problem number four one six alright converting six power ten one strategy touse convert one sixth decimal well long division six divisor ill bring one ill show need gon na bring decimal know six goes one zero times six goes one times six six ill subtract ill bring four zero six goes forty six times ill bring four zero notice six goes forty six times whats ladies gentle men six gon na continue repeat alright gon na keep going forever result zero decimal six six ladies gent six time number series use cal led decimal bar like answer pro number four thats let check next example next example alright two third well long division cant change power wont become ten hundred thousand evenly let see many times goes two going ladies three going two zero times right gon na show decimal three goes twenty six times becomes ill zero goes times right look times still mean six going continue repeat happen write result decimal bar six six going answer problem number five like right problem number six right problem number six convert decimal long division gon na gon na show good measure bring decimal go one go times subtract ill bring ill bring next zero zero times ill bring another zero alright every time bring need place number division symbol goes nine times nine times thats ill bring ill bring another zero zero times add another zero bring find goes whats happening ladies gentleman notice zero nine write answer write say result going one nine decimal zero nine see long division thats zero nine keep write answer like nine hundred thats thats p roud number six ladies next one prod umber seven pro number seven four ninth nine becoming power ten worry strategy remember strategy works make denominator ten hundred thousand ten thousand aka power ten well definitely long division problem ill divisor nine going four gon na show good measure brought decimal nine goes zero times however four times well subtract ill bring zero nine goes yeah four times look look like well four right theyre forever write solution simply say four tenth thats answer ladies gentle men four like right one problem right prime number eight let check problem number eight well one thing becoming power definitely use long division convert fraction decimal going show seven divisor going five gon na put good measure right see happen gon na seven going five zero times seven goes times know right subtract ill bring goes times go ahead bring well subtract ill bring bring another goes times times ill bring ill bring goes twice well times subtract ill bring goes gentle men goes going times times give minus well bring another goes thats going tobe times times right times right wondering going end see goes many times times ladies going remember beginning division problem indicator especially fact two confirming going repeat point answer ladies decimal bar going thousand two hundred eighty five millionth going repeat problem thats right going continue repeat ladies gentle men answer problem number
