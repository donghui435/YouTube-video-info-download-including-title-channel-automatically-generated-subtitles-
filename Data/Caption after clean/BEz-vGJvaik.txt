something like think say want try list mean cant actually list theres infinitely many cant even make scheme listing theres uncountably infinitely many see cantor diagonal proof cause something little bit impossible doesnt mean cant fun trying learning ways list maybe start making tree start combination first digit come digit could come digit well exponential tree number thing get possible combination digit si call wait thats name let us engage nope also company anyway every node digit tree represent number number grow really fast doesnt change theoretically list line layer layer count everything tree layer theres layer layer get big long finite go infinitely tree theres eventually infinite number countable sort infinity node counting number assigned thus list infinite number every number mean combination right number go get last one thats node number works fine theres finite number stop last one theres tricky like pi guess since working whatever still use scheme follow pi path branch branch branch branch never get last digit still go infinite pi fact real number thought infinite path going example mean take third branch time usual finite tree every node single path goes every path goes single node theres correspondence number number first think might assume thats still case infinite tree number countable every real number included tree show number real actually countably infinite mathematics much weird er something true finite case thing doesnt mean true infinity get involved sure number finite number path along one countably infinite infinite path corresponding node pi path cant end node reach es last digit pi last digit moment tree becomes infinite theres path lot theres countably infinite number countably infinite number uncountably infinite number path dont correspond true oh theres word kind like infinite binary tree ternary tree n tree like number circle gasket kind infinity countable infinity like tree number infinite spirally path go along circle thing uncountably infinite think thats weird check cantor even thats weird enough throw little axiom choice see super thing get anyway really like thinking made scheme node corresponding pi dont know exactly youd yet know math making stuff seeing happen node pi node must infinite path infinite rest tree old node listing method assume every layer finite simple often somehow let number go past finite number going encounter infinite power infinity precise counting method get stuck turns see math hard make cool stuff want give cool cool name sare taken end calling thing generic misrepresentative like real complex would call type number make sense make sense anyway reason like theres pi node get try imagine neighborhood look like like number node next pi node neighboring last digit change last digit pi maybe neighboring node uncountably many infinitely far maybe neighboring node also equal pi maybe like like neighboring pi node pi plus really thing thing would equal zero would pi maybe theres infinite pi increment add something measurable get usually go one node number one digit pi minus one digit still infinity still exactly pi guess goup infinite number branch es get finite theres path get like connected overly infinite path cant actually get one guess would like pi path infinite ray going towards make path include infinity go beyond regular ray even though infinitely long would still never reach long ray long long ray another amusing yet generic technical math term mean like really long sense long meaning topology cause like whole point topology length doesnt matter still cal led double something feel like ray would better capture way ray long even though continuous part arent actually connected connected mean word would better capture way regular infinite line short connect node one layer infinitieth layer still pi infinite pi neighborhood distance right infinite e neighborhood still even add infinity go uncountably infinite number sort would find like shouldnt make sense kind probably used mean could make less sense like even regular real opposed rational close good name cal led ratio able yeah real make sense first place infinite cause conceptual weirdness unfortunately sanity like pi seem come part parcel universe universe weird thing make universe stuff like space wave time none make sense either anyway something like think sometimes
