voice bunch listed goal video see different type number let draw circle represent fraction two integer course denominator cant equal zero dont know mean put zero denominator let call standard way calling thing fraction two integer call rational number sand something fraction two integer call irrational number sand size circle dont show large set theres actually infinite number infinite number irrational irrational fraction two integer sand within rational integer ill let blue integer dont fraction decimal integer right subset integer whole essentially say non negative talking whole let subset right going whole whole right actually let label rational let color rational number sand course irrational number san integer well could say look think wouldnt say let think rational id say let think rational right categorize like always pause video see figure category fall would put diagram let start three positive three definitely fraction represent three one doesnt fraction literally could three right also three whole number three maybe ill color category three whole number member set whole number also integer also rational number three whole number integer rational number let think negative five negative five fraction doesnt negative gon na whole number negative five going sit right integer definitely going rational number whole number negative sure fraction right represent fraction two integer say theres way represent except fraction two rational number integer whole number seven well clearly already fraction two dont think represent except fraction two integer si cant somehow make without fraction type decimal might repeat right would also rational number integer whole number thing line represent snow might realize yet number eventually one repeat eventually number like fraction example going sake time example thing later gon na see convert fraction two sake know fraction two way would put rational represent either decimal fraction didnt could integer well throw rational number snow square root ten square root interesting square root non perfect square going irrational gon na proving represent ratio two integer fraction two integer swith integer numerator integer denominator represent decimal keep new new digit sit repeat right irrational number ratio two right ratio two sure rational think seven thats another way seven thing two two thing equivalent seven thing two actually whole number doesnt look like whole number remember whole number non negative number doesnt need ratio two integer sand one even though represent ratio two integer doesnt need ratio two could represent two thats going whole seven thing two whole number pi irrational pi irrational number take multiple pi take integer multiple pi like also going irrational number loo ked decimal representation never repeat thats two pi right let since consistent relatively consistent colors two pi right negative square root perfect square square root thats gon na thing going thing going equivalent negative another representation right integer whole number negative integer negative square root two thing actually two thing actually number different ways represent ing let see square root nine square root nine seven well whats principal root nine thing gon na thing thing let different color thing root nine three principal root nine ratio two rational number square root nine seven thing let give one road pi pi going well pi divided pi going equal one actually whole number could write pi pi right thats fancy way saying one
