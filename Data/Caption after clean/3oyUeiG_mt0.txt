right video gon na graph basic rational function idea graph x graph red got horizontal asymptote equal equivalently axis excuse vertical asymptote axis k kind know bottom left corner upper right corner gon na use sort reflection shifting help us get new grass suppose want graph negative x plus negative x remember going take graph reflect x axis part top right bottom right part bottom left go top left would graph f negative x horizontal asymptote still place vertical asymptote still place remember add function though always imagine graph know x axis could move everything else rigid move horizontal asymptote move equal three let see couple thing vertical asymptote still place see still x axis axis portion bottom right going get move little bit portion bottom excuse top left get move going move part right know part also going get going basically going look like could even find x intercept wan ted could find plug f x would get equal negative x plus could add x sides write cross multiply would get equal actually crossing point weve basic graph kind reflect x graph move know could always plot point plot point plot point get general shape basic graph x useful graph know kind shifting moving around help get new graph
