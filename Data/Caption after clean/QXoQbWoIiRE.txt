example left previous video drop piece balsa wood metal mass water happen float one stays afloat one intuition say wooden block float metal pin sink theyre mass happen shouldnt float buoyant force happen difference whats density look two parking lots size one three car many one dense one correct look two forest one dense one given amount space thing say simply measure compact mass substance object go scientific definition would say mass per unit volume short tell us much mass exist given volume unit density kilogram per meter kilogram volume meter back example wood float pin sink wood water density lesser density water hence upthrust water greater weight wood hence density metal pin density water though look tiny theres mass per unit volume within compare water hence upthrust water pin less weight pin conclude density object lesser density liquid float density object density liquid sink understand principle next video
