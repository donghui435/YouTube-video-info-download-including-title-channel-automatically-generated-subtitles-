one missing mele youve patient reflection excellent right sir reflection let another word common rather less technical one know nice flip something upside back front guinea reflected yeah nice like think theres bunch really good city whats idea ingredient need think one carefully direction distance angle injection point right need want reflect something actually need line straight line youve got straight line know get example let draw really rough rectangle right reflect across need ruler one gon na work exactly going go get roll get roll rectangle easy rectangle defined one two three four right want corner take ruler draw corner line thats provided important thing control lots line want one ill look shor test one know shor test one theres word looking shor test distance like instance already tell thats first distance right neither right one wedge tiny reason another big one learn untangle like parallel good close travel really going gon na draw line across want make sure perpendicular straight line like see see least mine dont know see ruler big enough fourteen centimeter away straight line make sure flip reflection want go another centimeter see line line length thats really important point gon na gon na repeat process way gon na go across get new point see happen ill show exactly want general overview works ill show exactly one zoom detail reflection nice metaphor need straight line go cell diagram let go way bit differently let go direction draw line theres straight line going get upside mines bit rough hopefully able nicely like illustrate key right actually important put new upside one right spot wouldnt reflection upside like way wouldnt reflected across line right like right next mirror right face reflection like really far away thats alright alright make always thats right line somewhere else way know right nice easy um hard sometimes instance drew heart maybe want try actually drew reflecting line often wed angle like odds going upside going back front oh yeah starting see see translation sorry transformation dont relate let try really rough way theres perpendicular line need go distance opposite way ill point yeah look sofar good point yeah another point pick go perpendicular little bit trying accurate yeah hold look check connect versus like gon na get shape like think gon na get stop look really careful human really said upside thats easy quite back front either yeah like two thing like translate reflected rotated sort angle thats reflected fact straight line today really rough better job actually ruler interesting
