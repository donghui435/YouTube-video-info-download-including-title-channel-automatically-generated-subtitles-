see find distance two point let number line minus two point number line distance point b one way figure distance counting b mean distance b method tedious tell us look easier way find distance find distance point b look point b distance point absolute value minus thing learnt first distance b written like b bracket distance absolute value difference segment b absolute value difference also written absolute value minus absolute value ignore sign number even absolute value minus equal always good practice subtract smaller number number also know distance point b length segment b length segment b example another example time find distance point c first thing look segment end segment two minus two distance point c absolute value two minus negative two two minus negative two absolute value length segment c four next video understand better help axis
