triangle one triangle surely come across exam one angle measure remain ing one obviously whats special triangle given length one side easily find length two sides knowing one sides length give us length sides memorize relation sides urge need understand something simple side opposite smaller angle triangle always smaller b c side opposite degree smaller b side opposite degree smaller c side opposite degree angle basic thing need understand next concept quite remarkable three sides always ratio one root term variable say b root let take couple let say given equal based ratio b root c twice value another one given length bas root b c anda c twice b equal interesting b b c tobe root look way times root give b root times root c twice b c root forget ratio quickly derive need understand equilateral triangle well let draw one quickly name need draw perpendicular b cand call ad angle equilateral triangle equal one measure degree two also measure degree look triangle ad c sum triangle also get equation angle plus degree plus get measure degree ad c actually triangle site equilateral triangle note c equilateral triangle perpendicular vertex opposite two equal part triangle able find term easily derive theorem triangle get equation ad get value root times triangle sides term interested ad c side opposite opposite side opposite ad root c multiplying throughout get sis root go thats one root forget ratio need draw equilateral triangle drop perpendicular solve sides triangle
