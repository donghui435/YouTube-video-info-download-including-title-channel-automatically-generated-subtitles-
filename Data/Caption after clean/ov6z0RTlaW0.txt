let try answer ing angle p q intersect form center b c first question measure angle given degree find measure angle pause video try simple asp straight line angle linear pair sum measure degree easy look second one find b plus c minus try calculated perform operation wasted lot precious time dont forget time utmost importance measure angle b dare equal vertically opposite angle b would simply cancel theyre simply value c care vertically opposite angle c also measure degree last question ignore first two answer ing one given value b plus find measure angle b equal sum measure exactly half degree awe form linear pair measure sum degree yes based angle fairly simple provided comfortable basic let try one based three intersect ing p q r intersect one point form six angle b c e f first question ask us find sum angle figure p straight line angle b c together would equal degree plus b plus c equal degree reason plus e plus f also equal degree thats sum two give us sum six angle total equal degree matter many intersect point sum angle formed point always degree next given sum ked find sum angle b c vertically opposite angle equal measure degree know q straight line sum c equal degree know value degree b plus c equal degree one average angle b c see ignore first two solution looking one average b c would sum three angle divided three make us think need measure incorrect know q straight line b plus c plus equal degree go sum directly average divided three average three angle b c
