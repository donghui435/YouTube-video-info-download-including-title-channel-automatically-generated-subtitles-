hello weve got quick tutorial radian well go pan con sector area star ted one radian lots confusion tell look like angle one radian big thats one radian compare something probably familiar draw one degree probably big one degree big go degree one radian like kilometer measure angle many degree many radian circle well comes taking one radius one radius mark sound circumference one radian know radiant familiar sorry radius familiar two pi times radius goes circumference two pi full circle think get bit strange people tend think thats formula number two pi six point two eight saying six point two eight radian make full circle seem like strange number use full circle ti dier well see lots lots works much better us equivalent say two six point two eight equivalent make switch sometimes little c used perhaps easiest way think switch think match es equivalent hundred eight degree degree talk pi radian degree divided talking angle choose tal ked something radian would talking something equivalent degree wan ted talk degree well id thinking split id talking pi radian equivalence equivalence degree different measure nothing still talk radian want still talk radius pi pi commonly occur ring one full circle degree want make switch two exactly could go radian multiply divided wan ted go back radian shouldnt really need wan ted could multiply pi divide pi equivalent able switch swap quickly see radian formula let give idea one one radius useful indeed mean simple formula one radian let say radius five one radian would mark arc length one radius five another radian wed mark another five quickly tell us length arc marked radius times angle mark outlet say four radian radius arc length around edge arc length simply r theta radius times angle working let say working let say pi tend cause problem people get little bit hooked upon idea pi let put angle let put angle choose maybe pi whats pi pi degree want make comparison pi radian let call radius length arc length would radius times angle radian dont try degree never times pi something like put decimal like good could easily work flip side wan ted wan ted arc length around side radius times angle radius angle well angle pi full circle mean weve got pi pi would flip side go weve got nice simple arc length formula next formula let take another couple look say area sector area give theres radian want know area radius area sector given formula r squared theta radian formula nothing put degree pitch wrong got weve got radius squared times binding angle bingo got point whatever ice weve got let one finish sector ill tell one good pie ill tell thats radian ill tell radius sector let go back one go sector area radius squared radius angle centimeter squared area sector well easily enough sector area formula radius still angle well angle one side full circle minus full circle six point two eight minus two squared pi minus put calculator want go centimeter squared got area two simple formula one arc length radius times angle radian secondly sector area half radius squared times angle radian never degree equivalence pi radian equivalent conclusion simple radian formula
