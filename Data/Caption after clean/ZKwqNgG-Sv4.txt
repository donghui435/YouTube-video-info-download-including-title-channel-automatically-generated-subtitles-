people give thing value promise return favor future money actually start ash ared memory dig show often wrote list promise known ledger call digital money money take form written symbol kind written money works trust people human travel distant region trade never met may never used physical money instead settle trust involved kind physical money weve used throughout history one pattern emerge ended form treasure often rare typical rock beach wont work nobody value plentiful find something unique shiny tooth bone human tendency collect treasure unique thing treasure based fact everyone knew rare rarity value remember alone earth value treasure wouldnt exist think symbolic value may seem strange value rarity exhibit phenomenon beginning value thing people dont drive us crazy mean find many toy longer unique suddenly dont value much becomes worthless garbage exact thing value thing based uniqueness rarity nothing actual utility throughout see culture kind rare rock money local region treasure one always recognize treasure another gradually people begin spreading around world global treasure emerge based precious metal shiny people rock allover world extracted shiny stuff grinding rock melting pouring shiny stuff pure metal give name precious metal instance useful almost everything built considered precious much around thats one ounce iron worth pay utility compare one ounce gold thousand dollar thats driven rarity precious metal important form money came valued everywhere earth work physical money value ounce gold dependent anyone culture explain power always tried hoard control gold form history full example people power collect ing much precious metal could stamping coin ruler face society via wages across culture history show gradually ruler realize thing coin didnt need precious important coin metal content trust number first took logical conclusion practice century money supply paper connection gold precious metal exactly like happen fair today money take form best way control gold force everyone sell gold piece paper money like fair ticket back cash piece paper gold link paper gold option spend paper money economy brilliant scheme ruler hold global money gold people carried local money within every country copied idea result modern idea government manufacture rare paper known fiat money paper money connected backed gold form physical
