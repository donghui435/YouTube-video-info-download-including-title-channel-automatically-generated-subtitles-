g day welcome tech channel gon na look video measure angle look thing actually gon na first ways gon na look different type angle also look construct angle hope enjoy video hope comes handy first thing ill gon na quick recap angle made previous video angle might worth watching cant wan na get straight first thing two meet say meeting two arms meeting spot meet cal led vertex guy might hey previous video scalled intersection cordon intersection point like cal led little gap little space two arms cal led angle look go measuring fairly simple first way measure angle angle one tractor napa tractor might actually different version one whether full come half circle circle either one theyre divided little party say even smaller divide little part one little part cal led degree symbol use degree like kind like degree might thinking temperature similar sort word similar sort symbol measuring temperature one know measuring size angle use one perpetrator well ill first ill show common angle get first imagine two arms theyre meeting point gon na first angle looking arm pointing way herb also pointing exactly direction might behave measure getting zero degree youd exactly right guess angle zero great little base start gon na start idea zero degree angle progressively say one arms going zero degree might remember previous video going particular party formed known right angle ill write right angle previous video loo ked symbolize notice guy go really really important angle remember angle occur rectangle thing like angle goes like coming one perpendicular ill get rid ill talk angle occur degree right angle might remember cal led angle degree ill give example ill get rid ill put remember right angle say angle going way right pin say angle going yeah might look say hey going degree example acute angle angle acute angle ill say going apart eventually went way around follow base line ride along tractor see go way around measurement degree degree way angle like might remember ear lier video made straight angle probably get idea thats cal led straight angle form straight line straight angle hundred eighty degree another really important one remember far weve got zero degree right angle degree sa straight angle degree angle theres another group angle right angle straight angle thats degree degree might remember angle saying occur keep going way around completely finished yet keep going around circle angle could extend even beyond start get rid line ill put little remember thats could keep going zoom little bit see say keep going start measure say angle speak talking angle say peak case going beyond angle hit zone anywhere within zone anywhere right around back cal led reflex angle degree degree scalled reflex angle one little thing might also realize could come another important one although angle talking going around form little ninety degree outer angle thats another remember say might actually consider say bother degree go way around zero degree degree answer nook ay zero degree angle degree angle two arms meet actually talking two arms going way angle talking part complete rotation rather nothing space different type angle circle really important remember especially right angle straight angle think knowing theres degree circle think theyre probably important thing go measuring angle circle next part well look youve probably got idea already gon na well get angle actually superimpose angle top back angle top look doesnt actually work well actually move tractor around say going angle little bit draw easy one start get try knowing say angle gon na notice first put vertex angle center point horizontal coming zero one angle coming zero say angle see back around decrease might able even go next step say thats acute angle youd right fairly cute little terrible bath joke youd right make sure vert vertex seta point tractor also base line show little pitiful get measuring angle one measuring particular angle got vert vertex everything good world kept zero theres little zero going measure angle might say angle talking might look automatically say hey thats hundred thirty degree hate break particular little ankle know look say hey wait second angle less degree acute angle really really important thing measure angle think actually try make bit guess big look might actually notice going degree start zero cant see across doubt mean spirited person degree angle make sure reading reading part reading particular section right ah fly see probably get idea construct angle say construct angle want construct angle degree b usually going necessarily drawn attractor like would start vertices would draw base line one way id probably better job messy thing could move attractor going move protracted attractor want move real problem betrayer wont want move actually oh look definitely move pretend cant move going eventually dont well move good shading wed move line zero say trying draw hundred thirty degree mark area get rid practice pretend got rid sure together would draw line next thing make sure angle even market like might even go next step writing degree anyway hope found video informative going video hopefully look nice basic thing practice drawing really really handy anyway see next time bye
