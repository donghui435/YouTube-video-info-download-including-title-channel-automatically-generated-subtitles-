hi rob welcome math v e already learned little exponent root used arithmetic time learn basic used algebra know one main difference arithmetic algebra algebra involve unknown value variable sin arithmetic might exponent squared algebra likely see exponent x squared comes root instead seeing square root might see square root x course one main goal algebra figure unknown value going learn bit minute first going learn something exponent looking important pattern algebra pattern formed expression x n th power n integer expression x could number n integer keep thing simple video going consider non negative l l limit n set n x power n x power n x power x squared n x power x cube could keep going x x exponent mean l l x squared pretty easy understand know definition exponent x squared would x times x also know x cube would x times x times x going higher value n would mean multiplying x together x power well x power mean multiplying x together x power mean multiplying one x together funny say like see pattern make sense x power would x help us see important rule number raised power rule property similar identity property multiplication number x power make sense x power mean x together seem even stranger rule power may surprise seem like x power zero actually make lot sense modify pattern little remember identity property multiplication always factor multiplication well mean also include factor pattern exponent x times x x times x times x x times x times x times x continue pattern direction see left even x gone know another important rule number raised power knowing rule exponent important algebra help us talk polynomial next video rest video going learn solve really basic algebraic equation involve exponent start equation square root x solve x equation word figure value x without guessing answer well know key algebraic equation get unknown value one side equal sign might thinking equation x look like already getting unknown mean need isolate operator completely equation mean need somehow get rid square root sign x ha get rid pesky square root sign let l l wave magic wand usually gon na harder wo ah wo ah seem bit extreme even help mean math operation get rid math operation need use inverse gon na try next video cal led exponent square root learned exponent root inverse want undo exponent need use root want undo root need use exponent equation undo root square root x going need raise power square square square root x operation cancel l l left x work well see works remember square root x really square root x number could multiply together twice get x example square root multiply get since square root could also say square root times square root see square root times square root square root true number squaring square root x leaves us x exponent root operation cancel undo square root squaring side equation keep equation balance need thing sides need square squared squaring sides equation change x solve x pretty easy let try another simple problem root one cube root x like need get x undoing root since cube root time undo squaring sides instead need cube sides always need undo root corresponding power power solve equation need raise side equation power first side operation cancel leaving x side power x solve simple one step equation simple equation exponent instead root one x squared need get x mean need deal exponent side equation undo exponent yep use root since x squared take square root x squared operation cancel leaving x work well think minute square root x squared would mean mean need figure number could multiply together twice order get x squared x times x x squared mean square root x squared x solve equation take square root sides equation keep thing balance first side operation cancel leaving x side square root answer problem x half answer anyway problem actually little complicated look first thanks negative remember video multiplying dividing learned multiply two negative together answer actually positive turns really important comes root mean often one answer example know square root multiplying give us rule negative negative times negative also would correct say square root negative square root answer example simple algebraic equation two solution x could x could x time could substitute either value equation would make equation true algebra situation like answer could positive negative use special plus minus sign look like x use finding even root number since know answer could positive negative odd root like cube root number like solve equation x cube solve equation x need take cube root first side equation cube root cancel cube operation done x leaving x side need figure cube root calculator knowing factor see cube root equation know x negative x also valid solution equation nope multiply times times answer would negative cube root case one video learned two important rule learned number raised power equal number raised power also learned solve simple one step equation exponent inverse operation undo root use corresponding exponent undo exponent use corresponding root course lot learn exponent algebra basic sand make sure really understand important practice exercise always thanks watching math antic l l see ya next time learn
