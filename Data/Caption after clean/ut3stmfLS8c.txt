video going taking look two concept set theory one union one intersection describe get understanding mean going easier diagram going represent union literally definition union would something together two individual set going union together would end sub diagram scenario union look like hand intersection two individual set wan ted look intersection would part overlap two set would intersection part overlap visual representation mean diagram really nice way look example actually going first right could suppose given say set n set set b given information find union b union mean put together right number put together final set theres however going write one time right theres one include every number set theres first set theres second one last one two set put together union example wan ted find intersect b want find set look zero one set thats set intersection right example like give find initial set ask find intersection union right third example dont define set set b write problem like either intersection union symbol middle set sides one would would taking set would intersect ing set right intersection would duplicate set well scenario considered whats cal led empty set element set fulfill right empty set definition would cal led could also cal led null set well two mathematical symbol could write answer one would literally set nothing inside showing empty set right common notation empty set would line two different ways represent empty set intersection contain element common brief introduction two simple concept would find set theory definitely thanks watching dont forget subscribe channel share friend thanks
