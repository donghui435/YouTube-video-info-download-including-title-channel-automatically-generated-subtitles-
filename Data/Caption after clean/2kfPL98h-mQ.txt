video begin looking differential equation introductory look really big topic written one topic well looking introductory level seeing differential equation solve ill start example one screen x take note x derivative x respect think time thats often case fact derivative respect x function x right simply variable function case afunction function time essential aspect differential equation function show equation thats differential equation x variable value x afunction function show differential equation want solve x mean need find function x equation differential equation doesnt mean find value x works find function x works little bit different simple equation like way back algebra example x plus equal want solve equation value x make equation true obviously x equal solution plug right x thats true statement different finding value finding function x function differential equation mean find function satisfy differential equation show definition solution finding solution differential equation often differential equation really important huge gigantic tremendously important big deal let see well check box right differential equation important fact differential equation sare really equation naturally describe process es real world look world especially look physics naturally come differential equation thing see going real world differential equation good physics describe good useful describe thing going world well see example go material well see differential understanding natural world especially term physics solution provide us equation describe thing actually behave world college study physics engineering probably course differential equation sa typical college math sequence might look like calculus one integral calculus excuse differential calculus calculus two integral calculus integration calculus three calculus differential equation de thats typically fall college level math sequence sequence first example going show differential equation arise law first course need make sure everybody know law name physicist lived time newton although newton really didnt like hook hook actually guy kept newton intentionally newton much newton stayed didnt move back hook e die new incredibly introverted person didnt really like people stayed town die one hook came explain force spring wall suppose spring attached wall like grab spring pull way distance x spring pull back theres force back direction f law say f equal make sense intuitively youve aspring something springy rubber band know farther stretch force force proportional distance like equation say pull right pull back left force spring opposite direction thats negative sign make sense intuitively empirical evidence dont stretch spring beyond whats cal led elastic limit spring going behave amazingly linear fashion like equation imagine imagine wall floor spring attached let suppose mass end spring resting floor going extend floor little bit theres amass suppose pull distance x pull distance x release theres going force back spring going assume theres friction claw across floor although certainly could include case friction would later well simple case first theres friction well know hook es law tell us f k x accurate description whats going force distance also mass think force acting mass typically comes mind law second law say comes differential equation start saying f equal also know f equal negative k x say equal negative k x know acceleration second derivative position write write times second derivative x squared x negative k x look x derivative x actually second derivative x x derivative showing equation differential equation show naturally understanding physics case physics force spring second law make sense x afunction time pull certain distance x release spring going pull back pull back going gain momentum back toward wall going get going get enough speed overshoot point star ted going go toward wall compress ing spring spring compress es going exert force back right thats going cause slow stop move back right going oscillate back thats make sense pull goes boring going going back forth frequency oscillate going depend mass stiffness spring going function time x function time differential equation describe situation could math solve equation could find function x x function time differential equation math fairly difficult solution bad ill show solution math solve solution would x equal tox thats initial position times cosine square root k n times k stiffness spring equation f k x mass position x function time could differentiate twice could find second derivative show equation thats hard getting equation little bit advanced going right well come back exercise least show fact satisfy equation next video ill show another differential equation show sup real world well actually work solution show get differential equation solution
