whats theorem basically dealing polyhedron made figured formula number face plus number vertices equal number two know two three find quantity ill show explain little face basically sides theyre polygon theyre like rectangle pentagon know type thing vertices point line segment come together make polygon come together point edge face come together form segment ill show mean couple example one see like cube maybe square prism maybe rectangular prism main thing let look face see theres rectangle right left front back basically six let count vertices vertices point one two three four base five six seven eight top theres eight vertices number edge theres top bottom sides thats plus let see make sense equal let take look another example one pentagonal pyramid base pentagon see made five triangle comes point count number one bottom thats pentagon five theres way around know theres six face vertices easy count one two three four five six let leave number minute let plus two equal e plus two subtract two see number edge let see verify bottom pentagon sides see theres theres edge last example triangle triangular pyramid prism two bases parallel congruent pyramid one base comes point two bases parallel congruent theyre separate height see theres two bases theres three rectangle sand make side thats thats five face theres point k number edge top bottom side three line segment k thats plus got complicated shape know maybe lot sides lot face two could solve missing third quantity hope understand theorem little bit better go ahead subscribe channel check many past video look forward seeing future ill talk soon
