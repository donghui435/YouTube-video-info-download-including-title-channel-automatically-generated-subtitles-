video talking volume sphere see dont actually sphere half sphere otherwise known hemisphere yes going tackle similar fashion pyramid want think third grade level icing making rigorous proof kind demonstration well leave proof later object would need compare curved surface nice keep curved surface maybe cone yes curved surface got circuit got base know volume may dont know thats thats gon na hard thats gon na little difficult maybe well use shape use cone use cylinder oh nice base match match tall make try eliminate many variable choose height height convenient us gon na make height excuse diameter see alright think greater cone less know let go see well like take course twice time oh pi thats right everything circle pi right gon na enough right let see totally sure see goes exactly line live right spewing top yes indeed three hemisphere one cylinder hemisphere take three gon na get one cylinder right good thing know radius equal radius big height well diameter going equal diameter die oh times radius right right volume nothing put another base times height right thats area base pi r squared times height big height mean pi r three want volume one hemisphere would oh three times ill right give odds correctly three times volume one hemisphere equal two pi r cube therefore volume one hemisphere equal two pi r cube divided one hemisphere want find whole sphere thats double volume sphere equal pi cute two important today course know whether sphere cutting half give hemisphere know hemisphere know pierce fantastic oh go problem today right give four piece one hymn excuse radius five hemisphere radius two anda quarter inch es careful three sphere radius four hemisphere diameter eighteen inch es want exact round make sure give exact answer round nearest hundredth simple easy right right see tomorrow
