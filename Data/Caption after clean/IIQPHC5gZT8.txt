remember scientific notation write whole bunch wed express maybe something like point determine many significant figure like expressed scientific notation well know hard really easy completely ignore raised exponent thing want want pay attention call mantissa didnt make actually word know look want concentrate energy mantissa five point four nonzero mean three significant dont pay attention ten raised cross looking many significant figure scientific notation expression say seven point one zero zero times ten auto negative eight dont worry raised power look mantissa look mantissa seven point one zero zero significant theyre right right decimal place four significant figure mantissa mean four significant figure number let tend whatever power confuse number right let stake look significant figure scientific notation division problem division multiplication way going one example times ten twelfth divided nine point eight point three three times ten eighth weve said scientific notation first thing want want break problem two first thing going going take divide point three zero divided eight point three three zero math get zero point two four zero zero nine six first part significant figure round pay attention mantis es number two point zero two significant figure eight point three three zero zero coming right decimal place four significant round lower number zero point two four remember coming left decimal place dont worry point two four keep going look right keep zero keep zero point answer rounded two significant figure remember route significant figure rounding didnt pay attention eight doesnt anything second part division equation going look raised power going divided divide subtract exponent going going give us answer division problem going dont worry significant figure half problem going final times remember correct scientific notation always written one digit decimal place want one digit left decimal important left decimal zero zero point two four want change two point four order take decimal place move one spot right move decimal place right take exponent move since one gon na go fourth one third answer notation also correct number scientific also correct number quickly recap division attention scientific note two significant like normally would rounding attention ten twelfth intended dont let confuse important division multiplication like would problem ten whatever power finish figure end division would true multiplication addition subtraction different significant figure rule scientific notation ten see fourth fourth mean add said going break two different first thing going one one three plus nine point add math three one three eleven remember rule addition subtraction significant figure find fe west place decimal nine point two draw line right next show going round keep three look one keep around keep eleven point three first half equation attention scientifically attention significant didnt pay attention raise power since addition keep ten fourth dont change dont like add dont subtract ten fourth ten fourth end upwith addition answer get correct scientific notation want one digit decimal eleven point three want change one point one three order mean take decimal place move one spot left move decimal place left mean take exponent increase case move decimal place one spot increase ten fourth one spot ten fifth ismy final answer incorrect scientific notation rounded correct number significant figure math addition subtraction multiplication division like would problem paying attention significant figure worrying whatever power round make sure final answer incorrect scientific notation scientific notation significant figure
