g day jam es another math guy two problem like many thing life two problem mind right surprise realize two distinct problem actually problem disguise following tie candy whoa let explain tie falling problem travel great deal ill take tie school tie st mark school boston area go st mark right wear tie like show later unpack time ideally suitcase id lay tie perfectly flat way trouble suitcase long right thats normal work next best thing fold tie half great lay way dont like check ing everything turns long formy bag right maybe fall quarters great definitely luggage trouble later unfold tie crease mark right quarter mark show ah dont like figured actually falling tie third would perfect give great length doesnt show crease mark still bag question one fold tie third challenge life measure bowl candy actually candy often happen want equally among three people happen life dont ask right one approach course could actually count candy go know piece piece cut tedious divide give person mathematician mathematician dont like work avoid hard work cost work hard hard work wondering way could actually share candy equally among three people way avoid avoid actually count occur red exactly problem let give away answer let first first tie folding problem fold tie one gon na gon na make lousy approximation third look like bad bad third way thats third time holdup theres bad approximation pick long end thats dangling bring hand thats holding tie create sa loop ill pinch drop everything aha give new long end ill pick hand got another loop ill drop section time holding longer close approximation stood think good third gon na process pick long end hold grab loop drop pick new long end sham see pretty quick good like third huh grab loop drop claim mighty close perfect tiling fact pick tie suitcase way grand set travel great real question whats mathematics work let talk first saw candy problem let go candy demonstration next candy pilled table service see candy vary well pretend candy mission select exactly one third candy without going tedious process counting well actually mimic tie folding problem follow process precisely candy rather length tie goes first start making lousy approximation one foot sure thats lousy one third estimate however tie lousy estimate took long length case big pile split half split half great ill bring half pass small file great tie took new long end fold half speed half correspond splitting new big pile half eyeball ing lots human error bingo goes well much better approximation one third candy star ted actually typhus listen let go spoke summation process twice ill split long length big pile half split new big pile along way half yes see theres lots human error alright good approximation let secret actually know many group piece board right theyre divided three close piece goes make oneanother twenty three three three one half way hopefully three three three one two forty three three three one fifty three three three one sixty one got exactly one third bingo beautiful let explain whats going ill piece piece paper represent tie done drawn perfect mark one third along tie great ideal fault typhoon process discrete version candy making lousy first approximation ill lousy first approximation ill great theres lousy approximation theres true correct value see error look like smidgen inch inch idea fold improving error inch guess first thought long end either big pile candy longer tie fought half get new approximation new approximation see marc us show camera look close ideal position forward begin ideal position therein fact measured error like smidgen half inch fact error reduced little bit mathematics either stick way prove whenever fold amount begin fold reduce error new long answer new long end look position great really close ideal long fold side long fold side exactly tie see gone approximation dont even see camera barely see right side big black line actually every time get crease get closer closer ideal position get half distance time brilliant fact whats lovely process theres nothing special third challenge try figure folding process theyll get tie fold position lots stuff think whats cool stuff folding candy love discrete version candy actually worked
