video look area perimeter volume circular basic going find first one looking radiance radiance distance center circle outside circle doesnt matter sort talk outside circle reducing distance middle outside always next time one looking diameter distance across span circle twice distance radius next ill circumference circumference saying perimeter circle distance around outside circle finally going letter pi day symbol shown constant fair bit working first well look area area circle pi r square mean pi times r well consider radius centimeter substituting value area equal pi times equal times multiply give us answer roughly centimeter capital another example example radius substitute value area equal pi times times equal times equal point working air simple matter substituting radius formula pi r square next label conference remember circumference perimeter circle distance running outside circumference equal pi r matter substituting value radius circumference would equal times pi times equal times calculate point five another example next example diameter centimeter work radius radius nearly half diamond half centimeter substitute formula circumference pi point give us answer twenty eight point two eight centimeter sand circumference next well look working volume cylinder considering volume cylinder ill give big fancy formula first consider different part air circle part cylinder right weve already seen pi r squared thing deal height use two work volume cylinder well volume quite simply area certain times height could work formula easily area pi r squared volume pi r squared times let use work volume different cylinder first whats weve radius cylinder centimeter sand height centimeter well shading circle part leave part part blank separate two pi r squared point pi still times point times times five hundred fifty two point nine squared well another example ill show diameter height seven eight radius going diamond six substituting r squared six six times seven eight working half equal thirteen ten times seven eight volume cylinder nine twenty two anyway sum first area circle pi r squared pi r radius circumference circle perimeter two pi r volume cylinder basically area pi r squared times height work go well circular good luck
