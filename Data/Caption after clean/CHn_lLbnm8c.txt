hear temperature like zero degree freezing point water degree boiling point water though common way measure also sometimes used unit measure zero degree equivalent degree particular way convert vice formula convert multiply temperature nine five add modify ing formula get conversion temperature five divide entire thing nine much time think take convert one another twelve degree many degree degree many degree bit practically somebody ask real life expect ing perfect answer need approximate formulae give perfect answer take long arrive let see quick er way arrive approximate say want convert need multiply temperature two add give us answer degree need convert add plus degree approximately degree add degree times plus degree approximately degree exact calculation would got degree degree bit fortunate degree point six degree equal higher temperature bigger difference say degree plus degree exact answer difference eight degree converting degree get degree approximately exact answer degree number difference error answer also work negative temperature minus degree times minus minus plus equal degree approximately zero degree exact value comes degree convert multiply add product quickly convert subtract divide degree example subtract get equal degree approximately equal degree exact answer calculate thirty seven point seven seven seven eight degree difference much degree get two degree approximately equal degree let try converting minus degree get minus dividing get minus degree approximately exact value two case degree minus degree small degree error case forget ways conversion remember always multiplying definitely give us number convert multiply smaller number subtract divide good way remember c comes f c smaller f
