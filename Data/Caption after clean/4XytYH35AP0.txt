national see word rational mean ratio ratio ratio think like fractional root root mean solution equation equation equal zero also point graph x axis thats call mean thing way find rational root factor constant sometimes refer p overall factor leading coefficient number front factor constant meaning divided even lead integer divided integer dividing evenly leading coefficient going going plus minus factor leading coefficient would plus minus plus minus divided evenly leading coefficient take number divided number denominator come possible rational root arent root could try order find know root solution zero polynomial like know guess number would make equal zero might awhile guessing might try factor set factor might easily factor edit might form thats theorem comes see quadratic cubic little bit factor take factor constant factor leading coefficient want write could say like going plus minus going could positive negative could ill slip right could arrow listed dont one ill one possible test synthetic division let wan ted test see root go synthetic division negative synthetic division one didnt come mean zero root cross one try another one let say want try one negative synthetic division comes oh made mistake let would negative would negative would would would got remainder mean zero root happen synthetic division goes downby one degree originally cubic gon na quadratic squared minus quadratic quadratic formula find factor going factor factor two factor two binomial x minus x minus set zero get three two one two mean write form going thats two right minus three x minus two zero x minus zero factor x minus zero factor x minus one polynomial form set factor zero get graph going cross one two three leading coefficient positive tell us going go right odd degree tell going opposite way left making rough sketch look something like going cross point end behavior quick way geta sketch polynomial without know taking next level basically quick way get graph finding rational root theorem go ahead review video need go one time ill see next video
