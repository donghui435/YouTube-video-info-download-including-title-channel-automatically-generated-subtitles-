find common factor monomial snow common factor anything factor thats divisible talking pure case monomial snow little bit careful talk context algebraic expression like point view include factor necessarily possible number maybe take negative value maybe theyre taking value less square actually going become smaller number think without getting much weed think kind run process understand little bit find common essentially break could call prime factorization kind combination prime factorization part number plus essentially factorization variable write squared rewrite product prime factor prime factorization times prime broken times broken c dont know anything else c broken times times c squared written times mean writing monomial essentially product part prime factor sand rest kind expanding exponent snow let third squared right thats times equal times c third thats times c times c times cand squared times squared squared times times whats common factor context well least one least one c let take one c right two common factor context factor two monomial sis going factor going equal times one c common times common times times equal squared kind view ill put depending whether c negative positive greater less common factor two divisible factor possible
