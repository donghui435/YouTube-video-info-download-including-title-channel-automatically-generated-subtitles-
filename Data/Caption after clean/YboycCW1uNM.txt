let try drawing triangle angle measure degree one say special given one side triangle easily find two mean given one side find sides also know sides opposite equal angle equal b equal b c greater smaller c triangle three sides ratio root invariable term b b c also c root b length one aswell b c based ratio c root easy c c b equal root multiplying root give us root root root us v c also equal root like ked video forget ratio forget ratio need draw sides equal let call x let call one right triangle based theorem say x squared plus x squared equal squared squared equal squared side get x squared squared taking square root sides get x root x root give us ratio x root root applied theorem triangle ratio looking
