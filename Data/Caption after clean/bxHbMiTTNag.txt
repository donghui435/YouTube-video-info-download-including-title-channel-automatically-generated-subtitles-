hi hawker solve deceptively difficult geometry problem consider rectangle r thats made many smaller rectangle small rectangle integer width integer height possibly job large rectangle r also property large rectangle also either integer width integer height possibly give puzzle try ready keep watching video solution video description provided different ways solve problem actually involve pretty advanced video going present one proof checkerboard proof imagine checkerboard thats tiled light dark tile height width mean two make integer height integer width going draw grid first step proof show rectangle integer width cover equal dark square imagine rectangle integer width integer width going line perfectly two vertical see theyre equal number start light square let start dark square pair column together see entire rectangle going cover equal area light furthermore property going hold even translate across see far left theres column kind dark square thats going exactly compensate far right column start dark square pair going see equal amount light extension going hold true even translate vertically next step proof show rectangle cover equal light dark square similar proof rectangle integer height going line exactly two horizontal see going equal number start light dark square therefore pair going hold true even translate rectangle going see equal amount light even shift right going see theres equal amount rectangle light dark square completeness need show rectangle without integer height integer width going light dark square little slightly complicated step proof let try explain let say rectangle height b neither integer length place rectangle grid going line vertical horizontal line going round number adown well call floor rounding number rounding height b floor b rectangle divide four different section checkerboard lower left quadrant floor height floor b thats integer width integer height region equal light look region right region width equal floor thats integer cover equal amount light dark square third region thats equal b floor b integer height region also cover light dark trouble final quadrant neither integer integer height theres way going able amount light dark one little area doesnt cover equal amount light entire rectangle cover equal amount light proven rectangle cover equal light dark score side integer length let sput together checkerboard want prove something original rectangle r dont know rectangle going line exactly along one grid know smaller rectangle right smaller make large rectangle know integer width integer height one going cover equal light fill entire rectangle smaller rectangle end since small rectangle cover equal light dark square therefore entire large rectangle cover equal dark square mean least one sides integer therefore rectangle r one side thats integer length figure thanks watching video please subscribe channel make video math game theory catch decision follow face book go ogle catch social media pressure walker like video please check book links video description
