seen previously perpendicular bisector meet one single point median triangle meet one single point two let draw triangle understand median look triangle assume point segment b c b equal tod c mean mid point segment b c segment b c side opposite vertex segment drawn vertex mid point opposite side cal led median segment ad one median triangle similarly e segment c segment b e another median triangle see median point point f amid point b segment c f last median triangle see point say median concurrent meet one single pointlet say meet point g point median triangle meet cal led centroid triangle centroid number real life suppose pencil wish balance triangular shaped cardboard observe exactly one point happen one point balanced point centroid triangle always balanced centroid point also refer red center gravity basically mass object concentrated one single point want hold piece cardboard string tilt direction happen one single point cal led centroid centroid always lie inside recording math open roof help us understand change shape size triangle let us try moving vertex around matter move inside triangle even try moving vertex b remain inside case vertex c actually kind intuitive look want balance cardboard point centroid course lie outside always lie inside triangle another interesting concept median see next video
