another video teal injector alright today start little refresher circle vocabulary associated drawn circle c said circumference circle draw radii p c form scalled inscribe excuse central angle central angle course radii circle make angle angle p c central angle intercept intercept thats like mouth pac man right thats arc intercept may recall measure angle determine measure right mind another circle circle drawn two score excuse r two chord going try figure additional information got one circle two chord circle congruent draw radii associated dont angle indeed vertical know well drew four radii right radii must jump yes course two triangle la congruent triangle eighty yes course got mark right front angle excuse triangle sare congruent part must congruent part interested one right thats vertex angle kind angle central angle right say two chord circle congruent determine two congruent central angle shown right looking picture else could jump angle congruent well must true arc r well arc r dont know know measure angle right measure arc measure arc lab thing measure two angle congruent arc must correct thats second conjecture today circle congruent theyre arc also congruent moving circle going create chord well let put chord take cord make two radii court well whats special triangle formed think oh well course got two congruent isosceles triangle could equilateral triangle could equal definitely isosceles comes play think equilateral special isosceles right isosceles well else know well talking order happen order line isosceles triangle goes right doesnt exactly well opposite side perpendicular bisector also angle bisector thats order line right every isosceles triangle let put word circle star ted circle made chord say perpendicular bisector chord always always pass center circle right else like take knowledge make chord e f find chord going lamb right thats connect mid point center must true segment c well fill diagram look exactly like one right wive got isosceles triangle mid point going vertex angle oh yeah thats order word segment mid point chord center always perpendicular thats easy way saying know part order line right two tangent sand could remember back tangent tangent line intersect circle exactly one point point point sure tal ked cant closer thats really move closer mean got circle right point circle move right sense theres right circle thats point fourth thats actually shor test distance right shor test distance c well shor test distance perpendicular right point move move around either see stay circle go alcohol stay way go little tangent line circle perpendicular radius drawn point tangency want draw another tangent line going construct ing drawing theres point tangency theres theres one point tangency tal ked perpendicular right let go ahead label thats b e right b two point tangency center oh red must congruent right else know know fact mean like kite sure would jump right think need possibly draw another line line think think draw c draw c e create create two right say triangle right see ae congruent triangle c know got angle ill get aside god oh another side c right see c angle side side special one hypotenuse leg right hypotenuse leg two two congruent two congruent must opposite leg right bone one didnt write proof gon na let class two segment congruent going call intersection tangent conjecture two tangent circle intersect distance intersection point point tangency equal right think thats pretty good right last thing little vocabulary need talk tangent circle tangent circle sare two circle tangent line point internally tangent externally tangent let draw real quick circle maybe dont want size circle circle theyre externally tangent look like snow man theyre internally tangent look like something like dont know know spirograph maybe watch olive externally tangent internal tangent good luck see tomorrow type right back daily assignment see next time
