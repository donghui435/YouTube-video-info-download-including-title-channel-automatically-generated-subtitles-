quadrilateral theyre telling us rhombus need need prove area rhombus equal times c times essentially proving area rhombus times product length let see theres bunch thing know rhomb theres thing know rhombus know congruent side length equal side length equal side length equal side length parallelogram know diagonal bisect know length let call point b let scall e know going equal thats know thats going equal e dand know ae equal also know rhombus proved last video diagonal bisect also perpendicular know right angle right angle right angle right angle easiest way think show triangle ad c congruent triangle figure area one double first part pretty see triangle ad c going congruent triangle know congruency side congruent side side congruent side c right say area know area going equal times area could pick either one could say times area area actually let write way area equal area ad c plus area since theyre congruent two going thing going times area area area triangle base times height area equal times base triangle times height equal length base well length base ill color code base cand height height well know diagonal right perpendicular bisector height distance c times height altitude intersect base angle could say thing times let write equal equal times c base height saying thing times thats area thats area triangle right triangle right half rhombus decided area whole thing two times go back use information information right area going equal times area area thing right times area area right times times c times b dand see times fourth times c times straightforward neat result actually havent done video ill next video ways finding essentially base times height rhombus could parallelogram also neat little result proved video know length area rhombus times length diagonal kind neat result
