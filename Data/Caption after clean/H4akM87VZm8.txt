g day welcome take math channel going look video really fast cool little way working total polygon going say normal plain total inside particular shape hexagon many sided shape could work could six sided shape like hexagon could sided shape ora hundred sided shape could work total angle shape could actually even see theyre work big angle aswell thats fairly oh fairly good little trick also although straight id work hexagon way works going look gon na basically working idea first going triangle may may know triangle first triangle three angle one two three angle add angle plus angle angle degree doesnt matter triangle angle always add going going break hexagon going start one one point going making triangle one triangle two triangle three triangle fourth throwing layer one two three pretty simple triangle four times degree answer times degree total angle within hexagon thats pretty cool right ill go different shape look octagon probably know already many sides thats right eight sides would get octagon man thats bit bit ordinary bottom ill draw yeah get draw like get get try well practice one triangle two triangle three triangle five triangle one two three four five six triangle six times give us total angle six times degree thats pretty cool little trick right might say well work different type might thought tha tokay going ask question answer say pentagon pentagon wasnt drawing particularly nicely drawing loo ked bit like guess one two three four five sided shape maybe change bit accentuate little bit weve got five sided also works pentagon like break one triangle two triangle three triangle one two three times degree equal degree angle angle angle angle angle add degree really really great little trick might even good algebra anything id almost put together formula ill give view want know way pretty much formula bear us going show one thing formula total angle sis equal number sides take away two times number get always two less number sides eight sided shape number going get c ten sided shape number going get going eight times hundred eighty thats little formula use wim going show one last little application well theres know say ill go back hexagon say hexagon hand drawn going perfect pretend perfect pretend angle one lovely hexagon like case could also work size angle really really simply well six might remember work break four triangle sand four times degree could could say big angle need divide theres one two three four five six divided six see angle thats take little bit need know particular anyway hope video really really great little trick know use anyway suggestion hey let us know see later bye
