hi welcome math antic sin video gon na learn another common type problem gon na learn figure percent last video learned really common percent problem finding percent number example learned could solve problem like answer problem could say let look closely statement minute notice three different percentage really relationship number swell actually relationship forth number always always know see mean think back video percent equivalent fraction sin video learned percent really equivalent fraction bottom number could rewrite statement like equal exactly saying percent four component percent problem since know always gon na bottom number equivalent fraction percent rewrite percent symbol way focus three change gon na give one three name get confused gon na call top number fraction part part short gon na call bottom number total gon na call number front percent sign percent percentage since three different change percentage problem mean three different question ask see three question let rewrite original statement three different times first statement replace becomes second statement replace becomes third statement replace becomes helpful whenever given problem first thing need figure problem find ya number missing first statement part missing second statement percent missing third statement total missing three statement represent three common type percentage first type learned last video finding percent number type problem know percent know total know part total second type problem gon na learn video type problem know total know part total need figure percentage total part need find percent third type problem l l learn next video type problem know part know percent total know total lost yet worry l l make lot sense look let look example type problem know part know total know percent example word problem uncle really like travel visite us percent key word problem percent let us know percent missing two give us must total part case really part part uncle visite get idea sometimes hard tell number total bigger number word help us word usually goes front number see us clue total alright put bottom fraction top ready figure part know percent find percent need convert fraction percent form mean need convert equivalent fraction bottom number well one way could would look number could multiply top bottom would change bottom number number look like would work multiply bottom give us also need multiply top see equivalent since mean uncle visite state sand got lousy way finding percent seem pretty easy write know fraction convert fraction equivalent fraction bottom number tell percent trouble way easy easy change bottom number example instead bottom number could multiply get well easy figure even though finding equivalent fraction sometimes good way convert fraction percent gon na show another way think even better second way based fact fraction division problem top number divided bottom number division l l end decimal value fraction saw first video percent easy convert decimal value percent move decimal point two place right multiplying drawback finding percent way involve division division sometimes tricky calculator calculator really good long division way works best see way action let try word problem aunt baked nice aunt gave take home percent give know total part got mean fraction calculator enter divided get decimal form fraction go decimal form percent move decimal two place right give us aunt gave us gave us oh alright find percent make fraction part total convert fraction percent equivalent fraction would dividing get decimal value turning percent kind complicated lesson worry still little confused two thing help make clearer first watch video catch anything might first time second practice procedure really help understand better good luck always thanks watching math antic l l see ya next time learn
