video gon na go sketch really really rough sketch logarithmic necessarily gon na perfect point long know translate across plane helpful sometimes able rough sketch base logarithmic graph right log x base b b would greater one long base greater one alright know graph going one zero going goup right hugging axis make axis vertical asymptote right since rough sketch know dont really know exactly know steepness angle goes rough enough sketch good know long base greater one know gon na go going back forth logarithmic x exponential form right youve got law exponent say number raised power always right fit logarithmic graph going go right right base graph take equation log x base b make base fraction thing going graph still going go going kind flip going hug axis vertical asymptote top come right theres two basic graph want memorize base greater hug vertical asymptote bottom goes base hug vertical asymptote top comes right basic shifting rule apply log number inside function shift opposite left right shift graph opposite left right youve got number outside tell going shift throw negative negative front log going got reflect really hard think base graph negative kind kind hard describe alright negative inside reflect across vertical asymptote left right heresy vertical asymptote alright graph would reflected left right knowing basic shifting thats gon na going sketch es reference shifting opposite left right point going shifting going shifting point goes one zero graph thats point actually going shifting right notice vertical asymptote one left point right vertical asymptote one left point shift point start shift example also going shift vertical asymptote going make sure exactly one left point going shift thats said three example sketch guess sketch rough sketch trying get accurate graph right gon na going one going start red gon na start point right put red hopefully showing video thats red point part graph getting ready sketch thats going use go shifting right side function need shift opposite left right see see positive tell going shift gon na take point right like guide point thats gon na tell ship going shift toto left theres one two put going negative right point shift left vertical asymptote log function also always one left point right negative two vertical asymptote go ahead put alright gon na come back look base base bigger one tell gon na hug vertical asymptote bottom go right even though thats little crooked gon na hug vertical asymptote really gon na go point right right like said really rough sketch dont know exactly know high sharp thats gon na go least know graph done translate left right one got shifting left right also shifting well gon na start point alright keeping mind red red dot right part function right thing red dot part function sketching reference point moving around right going look right inside minus inside function shift opposite left right mean going go right spot right right plus tell going shift see minus mean going go going right gon na go gon na take point thats going move gon na go right gon na go thats point go alright point shift vertical asymptote going aswell since point sitting right mean vertical asymptote one vertical asymptote got go hopefully get one little bit straight right theres berg las improvement well right going come back gon na take look base base three number bigger one know gon na hug vertical asymptote low go right since rough sketch whether know dont know dont know quickly shortly really quick hereat point right thats know plane general shape right right last example look inside function tell opposite left right see plus three gon na go left three going come outside function negative two mean going go alright moving point imaginary point gon na put graph atone zero right starting point part actual graph thats gon na shift going shift one two left sorry three left two right one two three left two three left two put point right point shift vertical asymptote goes log function also shift also always one left negative one negative two put vertical asymptote going negative three right gon na come take look base base number zero one hugging vertical asymptote coming gon na hug top come go making sure go point right right red dot initially graph part logarithmic function right three quick little sketch es logarithmic function shift around plane helpful also talking logarithmic function really good time review look fact logarithmic function exponential function inverse right done drawn couple picture picture left pretty much important one two going work right recall exponential graph alright goes zero one greater one know base greater one exponential function go zero one right go right right logarithmic function base greater one go havent go one zero right hug vertical asymptote along axis goes right inverse equal x line got x line got exponential function logarithmic function showing reflection equal x line kind good sierra graph probably point logarithmic function graph look like probably already previously loo ked exponential function well picture right lesson common however still base thats fractional base right graph hug different spot right exponential function k fractional base would look like alright kind exponential decay type problem alright equal x line right reflect exponential equation line would get logarithmic function base zero one hugging going one zero right couple picture kind let easily see logarithmic function exponential function inverse sketching logarithmic function sand verify ing exponential logarithmic function thanks watching video go ahead give sure share friend thanks
