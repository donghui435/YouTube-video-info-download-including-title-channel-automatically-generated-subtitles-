welcome lesson geometric series goal video determine partial sum geometric term geometric cal led series geometric sequence geometric series notice sequence list series sum partial sum first nth term geometric series given formula sub n sub x quantity r power n divided go ahead take formula comes start following geometric series see sub sub x r sub x r squared way sub x r power n take first equation multiply sides equation r would r x term pick extra factor r first term sub x r last sub x r n sub x r power n next going subtract two going sub n r x sub term simplify example wed sub x r sub x ra sub x r squared sub r squared way end wed left sub x r power n difference would sub sub r power n take left side equation factor common factor sub n wed sub n x quantity r sub sub r power n could divide sides equation rand theres one step factor sub numerator would sub x quantity r power n divided rand formula well use find partial sum geometric go take look couple geometric series formula going use listed well sub n sum first n term sub x r power n divided r need find sub n use formula well sub first term determine r formula select term series divide term use sub would divide sub divided r determine n would number term series use formula geometric sequence determine let sub n last term n represent number term series sub n sub x r power n sub n sub power need solve equation n let divide sides give us left power n right written power actually raised power draw conclusion must n add sides equation know n must information need use partial sum formula let go ahead see answer question sum first term equal x r power divided r go ahead go calculator see determine partial take look numerator first going x quantity power numerator going divide course partial go ahead take look another problem formula generate term series also know term n let write formula want sum first term know n find first term going use formula sub x power n n would power x find r cant look formula see r would would find one term could use formula determine assume cant determine r looking go ahead find second term would x power first first x thats r would equal second term divided first term divided based upon experience may able see formula base also given n information go ahead see find partial sum sum first five term sub x r raised power n divided r little bit careful sign go ahead go take look numerator first x quantity power numerator going divide look like would partial sum thats going video hope found helpful thank watching
