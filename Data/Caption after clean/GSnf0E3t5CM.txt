geometry look figure say symmetry theres isometry map part figure back onto well isometry remember rigid transformation translation rotation reflection could specific however certain object say rotational symmetry rotational symmetry figure rotate less degree exactly degree less figure point symmetry couple different figure try determine symmetry degree equilateral triangle head rotate definitely map back onto draw right see three congruent since equilateral triangle must degree rotational symmetry every degree rotation many degree rotational symmetry look figure right congruent intersect ing pretty clear could rotate map back onto well since six congruent angle going divided divided figure right rotational symmetry last look plus sign drawn perfectly pretty clear ways rotate take degree different pretty clear rotational symmetry rotational symmetry mean rotate less degree figure exactly rotate exactly degree let say figure kind like see rotate exactly degree sit
