interested twin prime conjecture consecutive prime p first prime equal second time p would equal look gap gap three two one time possibly two prime differ exactly one next possible gap would gap size two case gap become size question many gap size two two rather large prime differ exactly twin prime two differ exactly happen infinitely often twin prime conjecture false point go along number line prime gap would always bigger two dont believe thats case believe case twin prime conjecture correct matter far go along theres always going bigger fact infinitely many bigger differ exactly two test found pair differ exactly decimal fact theyre surprisingly common certainly time look first far go million find pair twin far look billion far look thousand billion actually far start finding twin arent going one two apart still believe relatively plentiful far check computer seem true whether really true way far go something cant check computer thats need try prove real mathematical result dont actually know old twin prime conjecture people go way back certainly kind question ancient could easily thought recent time weve seen someone really write conjecture officially year ago de actually con ducted rather strong er general form twin prime conjecture thats bit complicated gap size also gap size gap size six theres suspicion twin prime conjecture rather older know least hundred year old possibly thousand year old still finding thing sway way number line know theyre infinite number known thing stop would stop occur ring like beast could stop twin doesnt seem roadblock happening forever one interesting thing prime often clear right answer give simple problem like twin prime conjecture think heuristically bit check quite quickly convince clearly right answer fairly confident way lots problem prime believe know correct answer dont know prove game always trying rule bizarre conspiracy amongst prime would mean would behave rather different way believe behave completely right twin prime conjecture false strange switch happen strange point far number line theres absolutely huge breakthrough relatively recently sho wed although prove twin prime conjecture two gap infinitely often similarly conclude four gap infinitely often sho wed either two four six eight numberless million gap infinitely often gap wasnt million somewhere two million didnt know right say one came gap able show least one occur gap infinitely million might sound like number people certainly lot bigger two example idea could possibly prove anything like sho wed matter far go number line theres always get bizarrely close together start looking really really really big prime prime become quite rare looking billion billion decimal example suddenly average gap well billion look even bigger get even bigger typically prime big gap sand sho wed matter far go number line get pair come really close together least compare typically look around ear lier work pint z came new method thinking twin prime conjecture problem closely related people worked really hard try pint z little bit big obstacle kept able make progress problem break came complete shock everyone think precisely people worked hard particular approach expert completely stum ped million arbitrary number comes method fact method really sho wed number didnt try optimize million much take exactly argument ever slightly careful numerical bring million million tweak argument rearrange thing ever slightly still fundamentally argument bring million million soon result came huge excitement result trying understand result also came line competition low make gap knew million upper bound first time finite bound also knew tweak ing able bring million smaller number low could go put extra polymath project big line collaborative project set precisely try optimize argument work came actually quite lot neat make argument efficient possible able bring bound million id actually thinking completely separate approach bound gap problem work came super excited work came cause fascinating still student time excited disappointed like feel like oh beaten really excited never belief would lead bound gap excited think always super excited suddenly one big result comes know collectively understand something new prime desperate get detail work theres always intense game play mathematics sort feel dont quite know exactly take long time fumbling around darkness really get intuition thinking works huge motivation part fun chase problem trying understand whats going still completely addicted thing working vie wed side benefit might actually able help big collaborative project could sort huge surprise actually hold look thing right perspective variation thinking able prove bound gap completely different way work gave completely new way proving bound gap times work work much based ear lier work pint z pint z used argument thats fundamentally technique known sieve proved great result come close together said could prove technical result sieve wed able bound gap essentially proved something like wan ted prove therefore use argument get bound gap approach based original way original argument worked meant didnt need strong technical input could use weak er result known past year instead one hand tend sort feel way proof know right actually write detail feeling yes feeling right time remember pretty scare first came know going much important mathematician really strict check got detail right often internal feeling thing felt like really surprise yeah suddenly lots lots interest post doc time came suddenly getting invitation fly give talk different place us really exciting able meet famous mathematician give talk work suddenly everyone excited really thought know please id proven nice result please id finally get understanding thing satisfaction proof really media interest people give talk people cal led may nard tao method terry tao also thinking similar idea actively involved leading polymath project came essentially method time another bizarre coincidence one proof came terry came new alternative method people calling may nard tao method current state art trying optimize technique new method new theyre infinitely many pair differ two hundred forty six expect every even number occur different particular expect two know theres least one method get us two unfortunately theres fundamental barrier method get sequel later work said really optimistic could maybe get technical argument fit together able prove strong result sort strong version u tang prove maybe push method get gap size six infinitely often also sho wed theres going small variation sort really get two get close quite way theres new idea thats get way twin type injection sure reason mathematical device trying detect time dont work perfectly approximately prime maybe get like one ten time one six time something like getting like one ten time maybe looking come close together miss whole load still find pretty close together may tenth one find one may times apart love theyre still pretty close get variation technique even really optimistic ever improve way finding one without extra automatic information really big new idea fact proof trait involve approximation thing arent always right doesnt sound like method proof already like bit hand wavy happen beat one classic rigorous proof like sometimes bit wrong like actually common feature lots modern mathematics maybe take inspiration probability engineering still write river mathematical proof maybe think whole approach heuristic much less rigorous sense might think lots randomness problem might deliberately trying model prime random object think always definitive thing bit approximate write argument write rigorous way intuitive come one first place often taken inspiration private sector mathematics science trying find breakthrough take us tell feel like youve made contribution thats gon na come another part map hand still would certainly still love twin prime conjecture something like think afternoons thing somehow theres big new idea thats moment collectively think dont really clue go someone needs come idea good problem back mind sometimes subconscious comes idea nowhere like think working full time twin prime conjecture moment dont plausible approach get current bias still get main motivation problem would certainly claim havent dont feel terribly affected outside interest reason want understand thing prime fascinated prime number sand really want get grip mathematical dirty detail although know theres lots good interested time theres generally application world real world certainly interest picked popular press thing like arent personal motivation somehow theres inherent beauty prime always really motivate try understand seemingly simple actually complicated object dont get like boss come say know jam es really good us two came certainly anyone come try get enforce make bring gap felt pressure cant speak one would like see solve one would excite think riem ann hypothesis would first choice number theorist term want problem prime riem ann hypothesis automatically prove million theorem straight away bat thats firm say even hypothesis automatically prove million theorem huge new understanding even riem ann hypothesis result proof proof prove reason hypothesis inherently must get good understanding prime whole new way looking prime number si would guess someone able prove riem ann hypothesis whole new technique would open kind new yeah choose one riem ann hypothesis riem ann hypothesis ever get brain sometimes think question connected riem ann hypothesis riem ann hypothesis feel good intuitive way even starting kind problem theres lots smaller problem connected riem ann hypothesis important par number sand thing interested certainly quite lot yeah likely find n know true love prime far apart large end pretty loveless place know end thing get bigger bigger might think theres way going find true love
