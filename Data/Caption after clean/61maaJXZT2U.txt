two talking circle easily confused arc length versus arc measure compare arc length arc look concentric say drew two radii smaller circle cal led arc arc let say extended radii way circle gon na call arc b trying compare arc measure arc length see since central angle since k arc b central angle could say measure arc measure equal arc measure b look distance see pretty clearly length el yon g th arc definitely smaller length b possible two arc measure different length fraction circle circumference loo ked circle drawn aright angle said distance x know circle circumference c c circumference know fraction pretty clear going degree circle circle way calculate arc length circle arc length circumference circle times fraction circle part right tell know measure arc b write theyll tell much circle could either substitute pi r thats circumference term radius equal measure arc wan ted could also use pi times diameter times measure arc key thing arc length fraction circle circumference talking distance arc measure different arc length
