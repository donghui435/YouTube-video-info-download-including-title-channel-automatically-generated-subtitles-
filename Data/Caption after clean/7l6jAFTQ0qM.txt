hello everyone welcome lesson arc length sector area first let talk circle severy circle start center point radius two basic thing loop radius around degree form circle know length outside circle cal led circumference circle equal pi times length radius also know space within circle scalled area circle area equal pi times radius squared since measure area square unit snow familiar mind let go ahead ask question didnt want whole circumference circle wan ted length case wan ted length arc ad know length radius circle also know measure angle intercept arc case arca v use whats cal led arc length formula find length arc b wan ted find area portion circle one sector know measure central angle within sector length radius use sector area formula find area let take break fora second talk pizza think sector area like much cheese cover surface pizza entire pie claim like finding curve length crust slice entire pie kind want pizza right let go ahead jump first example circle p shown know measure angle k p l diameter j l equal long want find length k l use arc length formula answer question want find length k l find curved distance outside area inside use formula need two piece need measure central angle theta need length radius thats going r value know angle equal thats value theta know diameter long divide radius centimeter ready substitute arc length formula replace theta replace r evaluate times forty divided term pi arc length pi evaluate approximately twenty five point one centimeter curve length k l next example circle k know line k c radius whose length five centimeter long also know angle k c degree want find area green shaded region going sector area formula question want find area one sector one portion inside circle information need measure theta central angle within sector need length radius circle already told k c measure thats angle want notice angle k angle want supplement find angle minus get degree already told radius length r value going tobe last thing need substitute replace theta replace r five times five squared times equal divide equivalent pi approximately point area sector shaded still order ing pizza right thank everyone joining us please reach us twitter mash mat dying hear please share love right done
