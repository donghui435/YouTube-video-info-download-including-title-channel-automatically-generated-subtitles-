hello professor v welcome u last lecture explore dawn number early number system concerned used count object sin mathematics call counting natural natural number limit natural number also saw previous lecture many number system could represent natural instance used natural number system standard seem quite system symbol v x l c represent two three symbol five one two three symbol v x precede follow pattern except symbol x l c used represent pattern used symbol c represent addition symbol may repeated three times represent group numeral combined form number example number written ninety plus nine rarely used standard symbol bar indicate value times greater first look seem like would difficult calculation instance take following simple addition numeral problem look quite complicated however number system actually different think group equivalent single arrange symbol column two number system look little similar first difference apparent number system symbol zero even important difference modern number system symbol represent different value depending position number instance problem number represent upon column hand system different important difference number system modern system system position symbol within number doesnt determine value since symbol fall particular column modern number system example positional notation positional notation symbol represent different position number example symbol represent consequently column place following one number system example sign value notation require symbol zero since different unique symbol whose value depend position number natural number system used today everyone familiar cal led decimal number system next lecture explore well natural number system bases binary often used working digital computer
