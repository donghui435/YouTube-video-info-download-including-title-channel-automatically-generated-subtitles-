today want video response response one time ago brad video composer alan video long video test loyalty think video made alan one piece sequence involved sequence came question challenge guess file quite good enough laugh able explain maybe number file able explain like going answer question today alan trying involve sequence apiece music first let sequence important sequence mathematics quite easy start add previous add two get next number thats plus add two plus equal add previous thats plus equal keep going way theres allan piece music dividing going divide cant divide exactly time loo ked remainder get left divide thats one thats two thats three thats divide thats one one leftover thats wrote left exactly zero left write zero going continue way going remainder remainder need make piece music turned remainder musical correspond didnt notice pattern curiously found pattern actually repeated every go pattern repeated ked thing thing oh period name think wrong thats another name period chose seven help make musical youd pick number though would got well length period would different divided divided would got cyclic pattern divide example quite easy divided ill make mistake leftover divided plus left left divided left would thats one left leftover think thats actually full pattern divide period whole thing point start repeat want interesting divide exactly theres theres well oh look look laser mistake look said remainder look dont need remainder alive problem knew period ha sonly one zero two thats another result mathematics three knew problem found thats another example another thing want actually every fifth number every proper bit behind room actually theres another result say number let scall nth number exactly divided use vertical line another number going call f result n little index bottom divide divide aswell give example look number equal soso theres little symbol value index every fifth number every number divisible thats chose let one example make point took next one look number divide exactly thats index every sixth number every number divisible period idea first discovered mathematician actually looking pattern divide divide last digit quick version colors need use black left left discovered pattern pattern period sequence pattern length divide hundred actually looking last two pattern look last three thats dividing pattern length easy way write sequence calculation number actually theres property add previous two remainder let look look example like dividing remainder plus remainder give next remainder like sequence remainder remainder plus remainder actually wrap back dividing go past wrap back take back plus give wrap back alack actually sequence simply remainder idea add previous give next one actually kind explain whats going next add together get add plus one got thats beginning sequence whenever next going end back going end back start shown always happen like big trigger point yeah yeah thats going send back start happen well look dividing period end theres thats going send back start always going end back start period always going repeat however general formula length period thats something dont know yet two box es nine box go make
