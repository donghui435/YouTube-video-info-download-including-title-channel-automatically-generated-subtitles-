draw unit circle fact calling unit radius length center centered origin length center point circle length would right right intersect along x would would would well weve gone origin havent move left right x value value back well x value move left havent move value well weve gone unit origin havent move x direction x negative way going draw angle way going draw going define convention positive going say positive angle well initial side angle always going along positive kind view starting side initial side angle draw positive angle terminal side going move counterclockwise direction positive angle mean going counterclockwise convention going use also convention typically imagine negative angle would move clockwise direction let draw positive angle positive angle might look something like initial side go counterclockwise direction measure angle terminal positive angle theta want think point intersection terminal side angle unit circle let say comma b x value intersect value intersect band whole point going see unit circle might able help us extend traditional definition want want make theta part right triangle make part right triangle let drop altitude right let make clear angle theta part right triangle let see figure sides right triangle first question ask length hypotenuse right triangle hypotenuse radius unit unit circle radius hypotenuse length length blue side right could view opposite side angle well height exact point intersection height right going equal b right b height equal b exact logic length base going base right triangle well going point intersection drop point x equal whole length origin length set cosine let use green cosine angle going term b sand might show upwell think need soh toa definition thats one actually process extending soh toa definition trig function sand part help us cosine tell us cosine angle equal length adjacent side hypotenuse whats going length adjacent side angle adjacent side length going equal whats length hypotenuse well thats cosine theta equal write cosine theta equal equal terminal side angle unit circle let think sine theta going let see ill orange whats sine theta going well look soh part soh tell us sine opposite hypotenuse well opposite side length band hypotenuse length sine theta equal b interesting thing point terminal side unit circle point b could also view thing cosine theta b thing sine theta well thats interesting used soh toa definition way use extend soh toa soh toa problem works fine angle greater dealing degree less always make part right triangle soh toa start break angle either maybe even becomes negative angle degree cant right triangle two angle sin start break let make clear sure right triangle angle pretty large make angle even still right triangle even never get quite degree sat degree clear right triangle seem break especially case go beyond let see use said set new definition trig really extension soh toa consistent soh toa instead de fining cosine right triangle saying k adjacent hypotenuse sine opposite hypotenuse tangent opposite adjacent dont say angle draw unit circle convention set let say cosine angle equal intersect terminal side unit circle dont define sine theta equal terminal side angle intersect unit circle essentially angle point going define cosine theta sine theta would reasonable definition tangent theta well tangent theta even soh toa could defined sine theta cosine theta case going intersect unit circle next video ill show use unit circle definition trig ratio
