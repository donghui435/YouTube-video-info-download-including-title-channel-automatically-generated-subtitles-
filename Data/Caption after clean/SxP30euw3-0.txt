jam es think going really exciting video today going generate find quite un nerving stuff dangerous really respect hurt youve ked generate random number right want throw straight back want play game actually want everybody right watching everybody want clear head moment want think random number ha ran choose number speaker tell choose speaker ha ran choose number speaker speaker speaker likely chosen learning quickly male speaker picked going said ha ran choose tell number say going choose going choose even number dont sound particularly random either going go middle hell thats random probably want prime number like trying havent worked hard enough get left left everybody choose something innately random number course thats ridiculous theres nothing random number said pick random number said know thats random ask came clearly thats random number property make number random sequence individual number number entirely depend context right theres nothing random random yes random part sequence least random human mind make weve seen little game random scientist model part modeling gas es need give random kick get star ted dont identical gas every time cant go give molecule random value use computer choose random number sand spectacularly bad theres chance getting computer generate completely random sequence random generate sequence look feel random us theyre random look closely enough always going find easiest way go write let write ha ran typically way computer engineer going go generating sequence random think number well call number first number sequence zero th number sequence going multiply number something big something random going call rather unimpressively atypically going something order thousand sat point theres absolutely nothing random whatsoever going take another big prime number thousand going add spectacular lack imagination going call b still random know random next step probably complicated biti going take number weve got modulus normally define percent cyclic division essentially remainder divide example use cyclic division divided get use divided going get remainder ha ran make big number process ha ran must still get every still get number absolutely every time answer going need sign get next number going take going feed back going use generate going feed back generate get sequence feel like might random start x always going get identical sequence going write piece soft ware random sequence need value different every time kick computer need different state start obvious way way simply use time use number merely second since going feed important thing cyclic division going eventually repeat depending choose b repeat sooner rather going get cyclic pattern sin random number snow dont call random call pseudo random theyre kind random theyre really random better though ked generate random number let goback game start going say let generate random number time really obvious way brought die throw generate random number probability coming thats always true want generate number get another die first cant generate two dice recognize going number throw get many many ways throw throw one way throw got throw double want throw got throw double throw load ways far likely let draw one die probability two dice going get probability quite sharply peaked brought dice ill throw three throwing thats random ha ran well done almost going throw three dice find get similar plot curve like go starting produce thing cal led normal distribution cal led normal almost everything nature theres probability distribution based dice based probability behavior lots thing identically get distribution absolutely everywhere distribution shape bit like sharply likely get average value still completely random cant tell value going tell probability value dont want hear ancient weve thrown two weve thrown three brought frankly every die going throw many dice throw many go floor end distribution probability number going get distribution people think random number actually uniform deviate basically mean every number sequence got chance coming doesnt make random make random choose number sequence doesnt matter probability choice may likely choose number middle doesnt mean randomly possible choose number ha ran like result random probably going thats random going win one youve ked give random number really want gone way gone safe something thats going create random number got small radioactive source going randomly give neutron turns proton comes electron strontium coming counter getting steady stream electron sand counting number count surprise surprise random completely random turn let show show thats happy sound radiation hear see individual one flashing thats electron going counter pretty cool written small computer hope works number going get deviation mean value know mean value count going giving difference value number actually count expect ing little dramatic mean weve got exactly mean value likely outcome yet somehow didnt expect going try generating another random number honest really want prime much random want spectacularly random number ha ran video got good news actually starting new channel bit like something lot ked channel going properly may weve star ted go look subscribe ill put link screen underneath video video description sort thing look hope see
