hi everyone going talk cosine cal led cosine idea also cosecant cotangent meuse cosine illustration going first going right triangle mutual right triangle way right angle let go theta let sides right triangle tobe b c first going talk whats cosine theta right triangle well finish cosine adjacent hypotenuse right angle talking theta make side adjacent theta b middle right p adjacent side angle theta hypotenuse longe st side c right mean put right guy tool cosine theta right triangle b c thats going first figure angle first well know sum angle right degree right already degree aright angle theta big well quick example symmetry right degree plus degree altogether give us h ossein degree another way minus degree well dont know big theta right going label degree minus theta expression angle right right going focus angle making red going talk whats sine angle degree minus theta whats inch sign right triangle sign opposite hypotenuse right angle talking ninety degree minus theta opposite side go away angle actually right side opposite side respect end going red get thats bat time aside angle hypotenuse longe st side right c value right adjustable data step know sine degree minus theta angle opposite b hypotenuse c right see connection think right cosine theta equal b c hand sine degree minus theta also b c well tell us two expression must equal right theyre equal b c write statement right cosine theta sine minus theta fact let talk know two angle add angle well angle theta angle degree minus theta know angle theta degree minus angle complementary angle see right cosine theta equal sine complementary angle right see thats connection cosine sign complementary angle let write degree minus theta complementary angle theta therefore see connection cosine cal led also cosecant cotangent c see remember name much better hope guy video please subscribe share video people also enjoy math thank
