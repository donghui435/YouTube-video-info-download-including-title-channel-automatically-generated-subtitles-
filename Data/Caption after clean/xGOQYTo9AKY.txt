first thing want look x want coefficient want coefficient x squared term equal one case factor ill something like separate example condition stick set first two give little space going write plus eight give little space equal zero whole point complete square look whatever number front x term case number front x coefficient x term one half take one half number always take one half one half negative six negative square put number back inside square get positive weve actually thrown brand new number wasnt put positive nine wasnt way get rid case mean getting rid would get back original thing except plus nine would well cancel going subtract nine happening left side equal simplify little bit point write stuff perfect square actually factor x minus three times x minus take whatever one half coefficient x term negative three go parenthesis positive eight minus nine negative zero write first part x minus three squared minus one equal zero trying solve quadratic equation point simply add one sides x minus three squared equal positive one whole point quadratic equation square getting step right cause going going take square root sides take square root sides x minus square root right take square root put positive negative one side left take square root quantity left inside x minus either positive negative one get two separate equation solve one equation solve x minus positive one equation well solve x minus three equal negative one well simply add three case sand well get x equal positive four one add positive three side well get x equal positive two solution check plug atwo four original equation get zero alright example one extra example change coefficient x squared make little tedious stick around need see example close
