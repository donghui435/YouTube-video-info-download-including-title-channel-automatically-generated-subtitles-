sometimes homework problem ask intercept tangent function well start identity tangent theta equal sine theta cosine first find tangent identity tangent exactly sine tangent zero sine theta equal zero sine theta equal zero integer multiple pi theta example zero pi pi one way say little compactly call n pi n integer integer multiple well graph ill repeat way would pi pi tangent course x intercept going asymptote well tangent theta undefined cosine identity cosine theta equal pi n pi n integer would example pi pi asymptote swell place undefined asymptote asymptote x equal pi pi two five pi two course goes negative direction equal negative pi negative pi negative ever domain tangent function since place cant undefined youd say except ever range tangent function real get number tangent function remember tangent represent slope terminal side angle unit circle anything tangent x intercept integer multiple undefined vertical pi plus pi
