unbeknownst many two ways tying shoelace see first step usually like second step like case see knot becomes kind perpendicular direction lace exactly mirror image done slightly wrong actually thats nice way case knot becomes kind parallel see mean shoelace two ways right start like direction let direction sense one one way point view right hand pull perpendicular knot way make loop left hand turn make knot case knot becomes parallel shoelace thats quite interesting turns two thing difference id like show one difference also nice trick know practice daily life let make knot first secondly think mirror symmetric respect mirror see strand goes loop whereas one goes loop kind like know rotation symmetry whereas put configuration thats symmetric sense theyre going see symmetric one match es shoelace think one match es parallel one rotation one match es perpendicular entirely sure explore let make tight knot fairly tight knot symmetric one know wan ted undo knot go really bothersome actually nice trick undo knot let show first hold like comes straight slow motion detail symmetric one close like grab two two doesnt matter one let pull taut get straight line turns knot entire knot slide across along straight line comes kind symmetric knot quite fragile like knotted like far somewhere middle quite tight secure want untie dont go mess around undoing need little bit pull slide completely whereas made rotational knot one think asymmetric asymmetric one one goes one goes symmetric respect similar thats secure knot cant really undo way undo actually go useful know way know thing certainly lot crossing looking minimal number crossing try untangle open much possibly patient enough
