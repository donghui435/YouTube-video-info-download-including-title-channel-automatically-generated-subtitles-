alright another example finding focus parabola first thing gon na actually come equation parabola well manipulate little bit well find focus want find focus parabola negative comma positive dont dont draw picture open vertically gon na either open point negative zero thats gon na tell opening downward focus sitting somewhere sort inside first thing going find equation form times x minus h squared plus k well give us vertex plug would x minus negative x plus squared value vertex positive thats well drop use information point negative use say plug negative x give us equation allow us solve value inside parentheses would divide sides well get negative well get negative value right really equation parabola would equal x plus quantity squared plus certainly make sense negative parabola opening downward weve kind got two different form theres x squared problem theres squared problem well definitely gon na onewhere theres x squared inside theres theres coefficient try try get rid coefficient squared term going going multiply sides negative ill get negative multiply right side negative weve got negative left distribute well positive squared minus dont really care much negative want glad theres coefficient front squared term look side whatever sitting next whatever coefficient term set p p equal value case solve p gon na get negative negative take absolute value negative thats gon na distance go away vertex order two thing could find directrix also find focus idea take absolute value negative would get positive thats distance vertex directrix thats also distance vertex focus k well use information said vertex said vertex point negative comma well clearly get focus well moving unit si would simply take focus well would subtract case look like focus keep saying focus wrote foci focus case would negative minus give us three halves would focus case actually figure directrix since vertex equal two add one half would get two half equivalently five would actually directrix case problem didnt ask know go ahead think
