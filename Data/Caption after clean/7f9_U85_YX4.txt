going try understand important concept circle divided two equal part show find area partlet assume radius circle r familiar area circle see cover half circle area half pi r squared area circle multiply half find area part look circle divided four equal area pi r squared since area circle split four equal multiply look another part part area region case without information find formula area part importantly trying find part area circle region cal led may think sector pizza slice sector covered two radii arc first case two radii arc second case two radii third case sector covered two radii arc coming back question find area sector area sector proportional angle arc subtend center cal led sector angle first case sector angle area sector pi r total two radii degree value value ratio equal half similarly since sector angle degree second case area sector pi r squared equal angle area sector pi r squared part area circle part tell us much circle covered generalize formula sector say sector angle theta area sector theta pi r squared
