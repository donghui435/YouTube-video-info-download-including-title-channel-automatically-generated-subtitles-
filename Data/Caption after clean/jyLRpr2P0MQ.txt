circle fundamental shape universe whether look whether look wheel whether look kind molecular level circle keep showing probably worth us understand circle first thing people kind discovered circle look moon see circle first time said well circle first one might want say well circle point equal distant center circle point along edge equal distant center right one first thing someone might want ask distance equal distance everything center right call radius circle distance center edge radius centimeter radius going centimeter sand radius going never going change definition circle point equal distant center point distance radius next interesting thing people might say well fat circle wide along wide st point want cut along wide st point distance right doesnt right could easily cut along wide st point right wouldnt cutting like place like wouldnt along wide st point theres multiple place could cut along wide st point well saw radius see wide st point goes center keep going essentially two radii got one radius another radius call distance along wide st point circle diameter diameter circle easy relationship radius diameter equal two times radius next interesting thing might wondering circle far around circle get tape measure measure around circle like whats distance call word circumference circle know diameter radius circumference relate say diameter really used diameter easy figure radius well many thousand year ago people took keep measuring circumference sand let say tape measure werent say measured circumference circle would get well look like measure radius circle right diameter circle say oh like would say let write worried ratio let like ratio circumference diameter let say somebody circle circle first time good tape measure measured around circle said hey roughly equal go around measure diameter circle roughly equal thats interesting maybe ratio circumference diameter maybe circumference always three times diameter well circle let say measured circle like drew say circle measured around found circumference bad tape measure right find diameter roughly centimeter sand ratio circumference diameter roughly neat property ratio circumference fixed circle said let study got better tape got better tape measure measured hey diameter definitely say diameter definitely measure circumference little bit realize closer thing notice ratio closer kept measuring better better better realize getting number kept measuring better better getting number kept would never repeat strange fascinating metaphysical number kept showing since number fundamental universe circle fundamental universe sho wed every ratio circumference diameter kind magical number gave name cal led pi could give letter pi like represent number fascinating number universe first show ratio circumference diameter going learn go mathematical journey show everywhere one fundamental thing universe make think theres order anyway use guess basic mathematics know telling ratio circumference diameter say ratio literally saying divide circumference diameter going get pipi number could write keep going would waste space would hard deal people write pi relate multiply sides diameter could say circumference equal pi times diameter since diameter equal times radius could say circumference equal pi times radius form likely see equal pi r let see apply let say circle like radius radius right let write radius equal put circumference circumference equal times pi times radius going equal times pi times radius times equal times pi pi pi meter snow could multiply pi number pi going multiply times maybe ill get point something something something calculator might want simplicity people tend leave number sin term dont know multiply dont know get something close maybe approximately point something something something dont calculator front instead writing number write pi actually think wouldnt quite cross threshold yet let ask another question diameter circle well radius diameter twice going times plus equal circumference pi diameter radius meter snow let go say another say another circle tell circumference equal thats circumference circle put tape measure go around someone ask diameter circle well know diameter times pi know pi times diameter equal circumference equal solve would divide sides equation diameter would equal pi pi meter sand number calculator could actually divide going get point something something something meter si cant head number simplicity often leave way radius well radius equal diameter whole distance right pi want radius multiply times times pi equal divide numerator denominator get get piso radius super fancy think thing confuse people realize pi number pi keep going theres actually thousand book written pi like dont know theres thousand could write book number number special number wan ted write away used writing could literally multiply time people realize like term pi anyway ill leave therein next video well figure area circle
