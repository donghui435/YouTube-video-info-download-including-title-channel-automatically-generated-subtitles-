golden ratio b c throughout history different mathematician done work golden ratio fact one working year give golden ratio square root minus divided minus square root sour version simplified form golden ratio want see cant take turn show correct expression golden ratio use take expression right first thing want simplify square root know times ill take square root right square root simplified form square root minus square root going continue simplify expression get something look like golden ratio able show golden ratio well let see common numerator denominator take ill factor numerator get square root minus ill factor denominator ill times square root k see divide right left square root minus square root thats simple going get look back expression golden ratio right see rational number integer denominator look say well let see thing get integer getting rid square root denominator going multiply numerator denominator conjugate plus refined denominator ill thing numerator essentially multiplying expression right hereby number know wont change value let go ahead multiply going square root times square root square root times square root fine minus times minus minus times square root minus square root denominator know multiply conjugate minus square root times plus square root get first term squared minus second term squared going end minus square root squared look like getting see square root minus square root thats going square root subtract denominator minus going k see common numerator common denominator ill factor end times square root plus divided times divide two two ill change order numerator look like version golden ratio end plus square root plus square root exactly thing right expression golden ratio show radical like problem classes really everything want student know radical know simplify ing factor ing common factor numerator denominator reducing lo west denominator multiplying binomial prescience herewith radical factor ing denominator dividing common factor kind class better keep trying divide little right correct way factor ing denominator dividing common factor accident kind mathematics going year fact cant tell story mathematics algebra particular without going fact first algebra book comes two hundred year interesting story maybe one later video tell story case good practice taking expression showing actually golden ratio
