last video even odd function si talk shouldnt get confused even function even odd function sand odd number sand said wasnt obvious connection word even function notion even connection odd function odd number sand wrong actually relatively obvious connection pointed tube user connection almost explicitly last example sho wed even function sho wed x squared sho wed odd function sho wed x third power wan ted show another odd function sho wed equal x f x equal x first power might start notice pointed archetypal good simple example even odd simple x raised power whether power even odd going tell whether function even want careful even odd function even exponent could trigonometric might type wacky dont exponent probably motivation calling even function sand odd function came let clear also polynomial even last video x third plus neither even odd pure x raised power sudden motivation calling even odd start make sense f x equal x first power thats thing equal x name also raising odd power f x equal x squared saw previous video even idea raising even could keep going x third could keep going let write general f x equal x odd odd function n odd odd number even function n even want make clear whole point video clarify motivation calling even odd function snot even function going form x raised even power odd function going also dont want confused something like x stuff past say oh x third thats odd number odd function pure stripped x third x first really make statement really probably motivation comes naming even odd function sand symmetric function seven dont involve exponent maybe type trigonometric calling even type symmetry say x x even power group together even function sand even though may may exponent type x raised odd power thats call odd function swell thank pointing
