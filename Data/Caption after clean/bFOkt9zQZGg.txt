g day welcome tech math channel going look video factorial would seen probably written like maybe youve seen special button calculator theyre five factorial pretty much every number every whole number number five five four three two one multiplying find product five times four times three times two times one five factorial r equal guy used lot looking permutation also little bit algebra well well pretty much basic could imagine five different thing could arrange different ways expression many different ways order many object say n object factorial would number ways actually order way also one zero factorial going mention right zero factorial equal one going throw little bit going wait whats zero would even write one thing going get much explanation oh hear many different ways could order zero order empty set youd one way mainly really worry used later actually make combination permutation calculation actually long sort keep side think going go different type factorial couple start start easy times times equal go bit harder one want ask divided going launch straight think get idea one would go working basic could could expand could say times times times going show little trick couple could times times going notice guy cancel theres one see left times times going show little secret little little short cut think could think also like could think times times factorial times times writing factorial factorial straightaway cancel always ignore go first equal give one try factorial would want put one calculator time going error message really handy use little trick rather working times times times getting huge number use right like times going going write different color wouldnt even bother write occasionally times going eight factorial yeah could even put together going cancel theyre going disappear could left times sixty nine seventy times answer going dirty alright different type question go bit different type one might get try five factorial factorial factorial times equal going launch straight work nice shorthand sort way factorial going end alright rest going times times times thats going taken care yeah going either bother put part n factorial times going put thats times end times answer try factorial factorial times factorial give one go see go hopefully going see hopefully youve tried factorial factorial leave us times rest going correct yeah youve got thats going times past got rid factorial left times going equal equal right star going later video combination permutation calculation thought video look video based first anyway hope found video useful see next time bye
