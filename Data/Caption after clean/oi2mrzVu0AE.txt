well talk numerical calculation derivative remember originally calculated approximate value derivative function x say curve plane like x value like want find slope curve point steep curve point well take little value right distance right change x point x plus delta x maybe really small distance like point really small increment delta x take point take slope two point delta ax really small increment slope two point good approximation slope curve point interested calculation pretty easy x right f x x plus delta x value f x plus delta x slope going rise run slope calculation f x plus delta x minus f x delta x call difference quotient specifically call forward difference quotient weve move right x weve gone right incremental amount delta x could backward different difference quotient gone back way would another point graph back wed little slope could also get fairly accurate estimate going backward along x axis course smaller increment accurate instead going forward backward could also could go forward little bit position ill call x plus delta x could go backward position ill call x minus delta x end point point connect two point get slope good approximation slope point interested right arguable thats better approximation see way curve goes curve concave start point go forward see go really far forward slope less slope point going forward case tend underestimate slope going backward could see went really far would end slope steeper point going backward case tend overestimate slope thats often case going one direction tend overestimate inone direction tend underestimate go direction time two error tend cancel case cal led asymmetric difference quotient go forward certain amount backward certain amount get two corresponding x value sand name f x plus delta x f x minus delta x slope calculation would would simply rise run rise would f x plus delta x minus f x minus delta x two delta x calculator numerical approximation derivative duro v function calculator second take going tell calculator calculate curve particular point know compute value youve told function scoot forward little bit backward little bit corresponding rise run quotient rise run slope san example f x equal x squared told find slope function f x equal calculator going type give function put parentheses function tell x mean calculate derivative numerically thats n stand numerical approximation derivative function variable x equal calculator actually going calculate value x squared something like going come x equal going go right tiny amount picture going go left actually going finding value one point five zero zero one one point four nine guess one point five zero one one point four nine nine going calculate value based function weve told use rise run well approximation slope point let calculator turn thing hit need hit math key right math option eight go press say duro v theres open parenthesis waiting three argument function x squared comma x comma hit enter tell us slope right point thats derivative x squared function x equal one point five another example f x x cube minus squared find slope x equal two well calculator x cube minus squared comma x comma let see get hit math say duro v going type x cube ill x power like minus squared comma thats function comma derivative function x comma equal like hit close parentheses hit enter look get negative three point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine gon na go limb say really negative four answer negative four reason didnt say negative reason gave really approximation exactly correct see something like really make sense round negative four thats introduction duro v function calculator well come back next video example show different ways use indirect function calculator place particularly useful
