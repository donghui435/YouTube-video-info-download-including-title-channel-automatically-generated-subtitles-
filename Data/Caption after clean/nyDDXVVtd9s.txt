first example give us equation function trying figure graph go right right left left well first thing gon na highest degree term polynomial thats one highest power highest exponent gon na look leading coefficient see leading coefficient negative tell us right end behavior mean negative x get x going go towards negative infinity even degree go left also going end behavior right going towards negative infinity even theyre gon na godown go leading coefficient negative right end behavior negative mean going negative infinity positive would tell going positive infinity odd degree left brand behavior theyre gon na opposite theyre gon na go forget sometimes easy little test say let say example fourth power times negative go x way negative term growing much faster two term effectively ignore focus term growing thats know going right put negative negative even power gon na positive negative still positive times negative negative know thats going left want talk write limit notation limit x approach es negative infinity f blank mean x going negative infinity going left happen f x f x value see value going negative infinity limit x approach es positive infinity meaning go right f x going approach negative infinity well going notation notice youl abbreviation limit subscript little bit line like submarine right water x infinity level limit weve got f x represent value arrow telling us whether approaching positive infinity negative infinity let next example think youve got idea one see leading coefficient positive right going go positive infinity odd degree go left going go opposite direction like write notation limit notation limit negative infinity going left x approach negative infinity theyre going negative infinity limit x infinity meaning going right x axis x right approach going towards positive infinity thats idea describe end behavior limit notation hope understand lot better subscribe channel check video math tutor tube channel look forward helping future video ill talk soon
