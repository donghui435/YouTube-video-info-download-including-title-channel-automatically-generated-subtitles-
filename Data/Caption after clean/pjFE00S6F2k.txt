welcome suppose chemist experiment measuring p h solution time apparently get acidic something conduct ing know little graph time minute find like something find little bit higher making doesnt ever tremor might find value got interrupted phone call minute plan value acidity solution time might get scatter plot like like starter actually increasing maybe nice linear way know often case might say right know know experimental error human error forth going maybe data actually trying follow particular line best fit maybe theres basically data trying follow question actually figure equation line well find line best fit let go theres standard method due fried rich gauss goes want try first straight line fit graph well want straight line try figure best fit data one technique course eyeball get ruler know see draw know forget slope line drew sort stuff mathematical process question best fit need pin mean geometry student say want choose blue line like somehow thats close st point sand way measure distance geometry always know segment degree line might think know right want line somehow add distance give least total error add little deviation blue line get line least red distance drawn geometrically however think whats really going scientist theres quite making sense data point going diagonal distance scientist knew example measuring temperature complete control doesnt control p h going tobe measure actually whats appropriate way measure distance deviation data point line case deviation line line little auntie intuitive think first geometry want go shor test distance line always degree maybe thing find blue line since philosophically appropriate scientist actually time sure x value fixed p h value case deviation happen p h blue line give total sum green minimum mean data point initial x value value finalize value along value actual data difference difference two value minimum add measure distance thats absolute value want get least sum distance form would like first data value call p something p h ill call actual first data value value line plus distance second data value value line second one first one second one want minimize sum absolute value would find line son deviation would line best fit brilliant except mathematics absolute value horror work absolute value problem nightmare example said solve x minus x minus value minus x minus value equal luck might absolute value nightmare silly back time gauss guy first work absolute value question another way sort vertical deviation without resort ing said another way difference make sure absolute value time positive road time dont work absolute value work square squaring value champion squaring value would actually give another sum positive deviation work line best fit minimum sum quite know realistic absolute value squared least give us good measure certainly sun turns deviation individual term sum deviation way sum positive number scan ending line perfect match together minus draw line line thats absolute fitting data perfectly working actually right thing us right explain philosophy people go least least absolute value ahead actually figure let draw actual data show work line least square actually bad think might graph let give tiny example suppose got measuring x value various x experiment turned measured x value x know maybe two minute mark value thought minute mark value something got data something well may doesnt really matter right job somehow find best fit data doesnt look hopeful right right gon na make one little assumption make math easier term assumption true explain true later video seem totally right somehow line thats going best fit data go average point data example look average people x bar statistics plus plus divided versus x value average value plus divided sense average point data point going assume line best point theres really truly represent data go average point given thats meant thats assumption kind right pretty easy work line best fit least square method example dont know slope slope thing need figure got slope know point want go say equation line minus x minus slope well place line minus whatever slope x minus theres equation line seeking know value give best best possible deviation right goes let work deviation gon na sort abstract world right value line actual value right x actual value according formula would got x minus three plus five thats pretty better way negative n plus value along line minus x actual value value cal led line would x negative minus x actual value x plus whatever line coming slope know actual depart data base actual data value screw line would minus minus cat want choose value minimize deviation show far value line actual value want minimize ya need space good bye graph minimize deviation since dont wan na work difference squared n minus squared right squared first deviation plus minus take away difference negative nearly squared squared plus minus thats difference minus squared theres deviation want minimize formula right gon na cheat little actually done already see going might well check know probably b mo particular squared minus plus want find value make smaller deviation deviation squared little parabola see squared upward facing parabola let get interesting egg value wrote minus use actually sketch graph value see need pen slow pen today zero quadratic value part fourteenth sit also value upward facing new two symmetrical know minimum going occur halfway thats min value line theres slope line going give least subtle deviation squared know equipment line best data let bold blue minus x bingo appreciate average point data actually worked k sort slightly abstract version line table actual value line literally wrote formula deviation squared turn three sum three term four data point summer four theyre sum thing always reduce quadratic end thats quadratic easy find actually easy practice actually find finding minimum value simple quadratic thats equation line least fit best fit least fit thats bad right give e key algebra book general prove exactly way actually hard going tedious though data value value yn line best fit going minus bar equal something people like call comes lot statistics x x x covariance x minus x bar let explain term x bar average x value like bar average value like strange x x business good rule make sure get minus x bar squared plus minus x bar square like deviation mean divided n minus little weird divide n consistency mix thing exist together x minus x bar x minus bar plus x minus x bar minus bar divided n minus look look really scary look miserable want actually work abstract algebra actually bad turns formula might want try right start assumption think line best fit thats gon na best data go average point people prove best fit formula calculus calculus becomes pretty clear youd make assumption line get actually line got blue one check line obviously going point x bar bar therefore thats abstract calculus fed thats real reason gauss want use absolute value cant take derivative absolute value easily quite annoying want use calculus something actually differentiable going better way positive able use technique calculus alright thats thats line best fit least square method next question course cystic course ask measure good fit really give us something cal led correlation coefficient thats bundle heart another time thanks much
