hi welcome math antic series geometry today going learn angle sin last video learned point line sand thats good going need make let start couple plane going dealing two dimensional geometry video conveniently cal led line b line important thing notice two theyre pointing exactly direction even extended forever would never cross even get closer together two like call parallel youve probably hear term parallel like parallel parking parallel universe parallel parallel never cross even go forever take one give little nudge arent parallel fact cross point right name point p cross point like say intersect call point intersection intersect form angle think angle space formed intersect ing intersect ing form four angle instead calling angle geometry name point used make example angle cal led angle trace along point like connect dot outline angle angle call angle connect ing dot form angle naming angle theres nice shorthand use instead writing word angle use angle symbol instead look like theres even simpler way name learn way let erase point letter intersection point one point let imagine line segment two point rotate around point intersection like clock hand around center clock let also imagine rotate line segment point end leaves trail like pencil attached trail path left rotate line segment way around form circle go part way around form part circle call arc arc represent angle formed rotate segment one position another like line line shrink arc close intersection point put letter like letter another way showing angle angle angle angle also draw arc call angle b whenever see letter next little arc like mean name angle formed arc alright diagram show angle angle band might notice angle arent size b seem bigger abut rotate one angle look like theyre size angle look kind like plus sign like cal led perpendicular perpendicular form square intersect square corner angle special name geometry really important call right even special symbol use show angle right angle form square use little square instead arc use whenever see symbol know angle looking right angle form know right angle let look simple one thats made two happen take ray pointing rotate like hand clock little little bit clockwise well dont right angle ray longer perpendicular instead angle smaller less right less right angle cal led acute angle son hand rotated ray left instead right would get angle thats bigger greater right angle angle greater right angle cal led obtuse three main kind angle need know right angle acute angle obtuse angle swell actually theres one type angle thats pretty important kind strange one cal led straight angle straight angle get rotate ray point exactly opposite result look like straight line cal led straight angle alright theres important geometry term need learn video let look simple right angle thats made two time let draw third ray cut right angle two smaller part snow angle divided right angle know two new smaller angle combine form right angle geometry two angle form right angle cal led complementary angle sand thing straight angle take straight angle made two ray divide third ray two new smaller angle two angle combine form straight angle call angle supplementary complementary angle combine form right angle supplementary angle combine form straight angle alright thats going learn angle video new geometry might seem like let quick review new geometry word weve point exactly direction never cross cal led parallel cross cross point cal led intersect form angle think angle space name point form like connect dot san arc part circle arc used represent angle two intersect ing intersect ing form exactly equal angle perpendicular perpendicular form right angle right angle square use special square symbol show angle right angle thats smaller less right angle cal led acute angle thats bigger greater right angle cal led obtuse angle straight angle formed two ray pointing exactly opposite direction straight angle really straight line two angle combine form right angle cal led complementary angle combine form straight angle cal led supplementary angle sin next geometry video going learn angle measure thanks watching math antic ill see next time learn
