talking today problem geometry fifth memory point able recall three square sizes next size matter pick one top let say top left corner connect bottom right three take angle bottom let call alpha next one call well beta thats incorrect yeah upside finally gamma alright question sum three angle simple enough problem interesting part given fifth grader attack fifth grade learn use protractor measure first angle degree sand fact stop think course since triangle looking right guy surprise get degree angle go measuring perhaps little bit luck second like pointing little bit maybe third angle wow going perhaps add seem bit arbitrary dont know yeah also mistake measurement would fifth grader much ending random angle well try make another measurement perhaps come upwith would say oh little bit obtuse maybe little bit acute would conjecture people leap believe beautiful problem would guess correct answer would think correct answer ninety exactly ninety would know really ninety ugly angle nearby cheat little bit say problem given fifth got nice answer believe moment ninety mathematician call conjecture put effort proving ninety kind third way proving know one sure forty left two angle order make ninety well obviously forty five somehow need add two angle beta gamma prove add forty five another experiment fifth grader might try also home cut whole thing eliminate error coming protractor rounding let try put everything together look like ninety degree let check well yep look like truly believe statement want prove well question level mathematical career mathematical life problem one two solution gon na brilliant one simple one fifth grader may able grasp idea solution least attempt cut scissors carried forward mathematically may want move three angle geometric location picture need find best geometric location move best geometric location know solution might well try move corner next gamma already right angle guy gamma two angle alpha beta must somehow fit comes brilliant idea solution said something missing picture whats missing half picture replicate square well start seeing truth think going start label ing thing people refer later important point choose connect two say construction swill done solution somehow make sense picture telling us well see angle exactly wan ted ninety degree angle original gamma could two angle indeed alpha beta well guess angle bigger next one way look perhaps alpha alpha bigger beta could forty five let try detective figure could come picture involved large see similar situation ear lier problem certainly right saw original alpha decided alpha degree right isosceles right isosceles triangle might could eh equal h two extra segment draw top answer yes two segment eh h two segment drew hypotenuse two right also draw top going mark two sides hypotenuse two right triangle se f h h drew blue right right angle coming top also exactly size shape right triangle one leg two leg one also leg two leg mean third size must indeed eh equal h dand way show big green triangle middle right isosceles already question guy righto kay else around angle guy angle one add answer also simple one e angle already know claim angle angle beta third triangle precisely shape size right right triangle leg two therefore angle beta must equal single beta guess must equal angle beta share exactly angle shown move angle beta wan ted gamma really done backtrack ing wan ted show big triangle already know angle beta guy well guy second right triangle acute angle beta could guy know angle triangle add guy ninety therefore must add arithmetic angle must ninety minus beta ninety minus beta something beta must overall give remain ing angle curly one start let beta plus ninety minus beta plus something must beta goes away thats something turns done thats right angle alpha indeed move along beta conclude three degree sand amazing construction triangle congruent right triangle leg indeed brilliant approach mathematician take solve complete whats missing problem becomes easier
