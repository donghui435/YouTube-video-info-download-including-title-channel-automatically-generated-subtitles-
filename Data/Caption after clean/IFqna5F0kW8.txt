right video going example induction case going prove part going try justify plus plus plus dot dot minus equal n times quantity plus n first thing going basis going show valid case n equal k let see well use n equal left well left right side plug put little question mark trying verify fact equal kind ked equal get well plug well get well plus right side well get definitely k valid going going induction step going going assume statement true going assume statement true value n equal k going show true value n plus let see little formula go going assume take plus plus plus dot dot k minus going assume fact equal k times plus k show take plus plus plus dot dot k minus one additional term quantity k plus minus equal k plus times times k plus right k justify justify last line well proven statement going use induction step assumption first bit stuff plus plus plus dot dot k minus thats going give us k plus k still additional term five times k plus one minus one equal k plus one two times three plus five times k plus one typically kind cleanup sides collect like term see fact know thing sare fact equal going little simplification go k ill leave alone moment inside parenthesis would five k distribute would positive five minus one would positive four right side k plus look like would plus k plus still equal well right side distribute would three k plus k squared five k plus four right side distribute well let inside parentheses well distribute three plus five would eight still five k left equal left side get common wan ted dont really could multiply top bottom two would give us k plus k would give us k plus k squared right distribute one big term would k plus plus k times k plus going much left side moment equal going question mark see distribute right get well let even simplify first make really distribute would get k plus look like would k squared plus k multiply little bit well let see think getting pretty close point still wondering let see take k multiply top bottom would give us k plus k would k weve got k squared term weve got plus yes fact two sides equal weve proved induction step together base basis step fact show original statement fact true
