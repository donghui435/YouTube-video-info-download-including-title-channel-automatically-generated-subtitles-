subtitle contribute watching video probably mean familiar infinite ever encounter infinite fraction many people infinite fraction incredibly powerful tool structure pattern hidden real number sand particularly good thing irrationality want use today chase irrational real get star ted let look identity save right part box box equal wherever see replace bit box example replace see another replace see forever seem say equal remind start guy turns replace two identity actually stays identity repeat game replace replace replace way infinity let look right sides actually identical mean course equal start exactly way last video unlike last time going tell whats wrong obviously something wrong supposed work comment ill instead talk infinite fraction end video able figure mistake number whatsoever representation infinite fraction continued fraction let show generate infinite fraction equal guy separate integer part rest number go rewrite one aswell thats quite thats something right evaluate one give give something remarkable coming exactly bad huh play game separate integer part rewrite guy evaluate keep going like forever give continued fraction representation guy special kind infinite fraction simple continued fraction make simple fact numerator dont minus es plus es let try couple superhero es among real example golden ratio play important role got sort infinite continued fraction got doesnt get simpler close look actually less another square root get something periodic fact square root slightly square root like give rise periodic continued fraction infinite one maybe try let take something doesnt anything square root let go superhero right look continued fraction guy pattern well pattern start around let pick look deceiving actually continue like compare continued fraction decimal right decimal expansion complete mess continued fraction beautiful beautiful periodic infinite whatever actually use continued fraction produce proof irrational well first look rational number whats rational number number written fraction take fraction unleash scheme whats continued fraction correspond number maybe theres bit surprise thing end sit doesnt go forever thats actually going fraction start fraction produce continued fraction correspond continued fraction finite really really quite nice check maybe one run scheme dont turn thing decimal number keep running pretty much see glance thing terminate fraction shave terminate term continued fraction expansion know proof basically e square root actually irrational well continued fraction expansion continue forever whereas rational would terminate neat point time going ask irrational number question may sound little bit idiotic first glance either number rational irrational nothing grey zone one number irrational another number explain grey zone let look identity actually check whether identity well roll thing bottom guy calculate keep going like find yes true friend mine took number produced continued fraction expansion infinite one give ask figure number star ted well figure number star ted cant roll bottom bottom turns continued fraction another really amazing property actually make useful sort purpose chop thing create sequence partial fraction first partial fraction guy second partial fraction one guy calculate sequence partial fraction always converge number friend star ted staring quick important interlude us write equal sign really sequence partial fraction case remember always pushing term ahead us eventually kind threw away three dot swell thats really pin exactly mean thing still equal point interlude first partial fraction second partial fraction third partial fraction well value guy rolling bottom guy keep going like well one guy fraction getting closer closer whatever number probably already giveaway continued fraction expansion simple one see good approximation let turn go digit actually correspond decimal expansion see one ridiculously good fraction see left side actually incredibly famous within history strict sense best general turns partial fraction come continued fraction expansion number best rational approximation number sense obviously take denominator get closer closer whatever number interested point small really get incredibly close wouldnt expect one digit able get close like number get close theyre really punching way weight fraction sand description say little bit precise mathematical actually get grey zone happening talking take two generate partial fraction best rational approximation compare well two number sis easy approximate easy approximate u h partial well let compare two guy example right theres order one bit mess one think id say people would say well irrational actually would wrong plot twist guy irrational number hard approximate guy weve seen easy approximate one really really well fraction sand really drive home point got table partial fraction next right left side see right really incredible speed hand best approximation really struggling get close replace pretty much number always lot worse anything else reason lot worse really really close look actually hidden plain sight got kind scroll like closer jump towards real value evaluate partial fraction something like incredible jump towards real value evaluate partial fraction get small jump get small get small possible choose small possible doesnt get smaller make irrational irrational right laugh well mathematician definitely care may also hear golden ratio present nature place fact whenever comes come lot phenomena go coming together nature actually continued fraction sand give taste going today ill another video show hi ding actually produce partial go see away right theres example natural occurrence thing swell look flower head like guy count spiral see one direction thats number direction thats another number people dont know actually focus middle part flower head like actually see different flower head like actually grown something cal led divergence angle divergence angle flower head like many flower head coming nature actually ill talk follow video either next video video tha tokay point time actually ready puzzle figure tell us comment whats wrong whats right really looking forward thats music
