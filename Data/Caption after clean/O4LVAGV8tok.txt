video going outline two small proof deal radius diameter graph quick recap remember pair vertices graph distance length shor test path take particular vertex graph take look shor test path sand look maximum thats eccentricity vertex finally take look graph minimum thats radius maximum diameter would like quick review terminology click link video check description first example following want g graph disconnected complement graph connected diameter two work proof let check small example let draw one one four vertices isolated vertex three vertices really simple want draw vertices label want think edge original graph disconnected take look vertex isolated going adjacent three vertices careful side path three vertices two edge disappear complement edge goes top vertex bottom vertex put edge thats edge complement let see figure diameter clearly connected graph figure eccentricity vertex used tobe isolated longer isolated adjacent three well take look vertex v middle clearly ha sa distance one path side far take go hit take path length eccentricity equal two thing goes right know equal one two particular example mean diameter maximum two example worked thats go ahead see prove general general proof take g disconnected graph since graph disconnected know least two connected component remember connected component maximal connected sub graph graph want refresher difference word maximal maximum check video right links description alright connected call g let draw g rest graph may bunch component draw bunch blob maybe theres one blob theres could bunch want refer two set different thing going call set vertices first connected component thinking rest vertices however ill box separately like alright wim thinking two piece graph observe havent drawn edge graph remember connected component mean edge green graph going lie within one going draw specific edge know edge blob sand thats important draw edge represent complement graph going use vertex set draw edge complement different color edge graph g within green want take vertex let call u set thats set vertices first connected component thinking think vertices set clearly edge graph g vertex connected weve said g lie within recap every vertex v v edge u v graph g mean edge graph g bar complement let draw generically ill use color pink remember color pink going represent complement graph obviously take look complement graph g lots going occur look particular green blob pair vertices adjacent longer vice werent adjacent dont really need worry rest blob whats really important happen first love talking rest v v far weve already observe vertex u vertex v adjacent vertex v set v distance equal complement graph know distance vertices set v big set v vertices could belong one side let consider case take two vertices v v big set v may different green blob original graph dont care think connected complement graph may edge maybe maybe dont sure edge vertex u back distance two could one definitely two next consider two vertices u u set v want also show connected path length may connected previously may may edge know since one side graph pink edge go side graph mean sis follow pink edge one side vertex back one u u vertices complement graph vertices distance away considered every possible pair vertices always found distance mean take maximum diameter almost conclude proof next example going show given graph center connected graph remember center set vertices whose eccentricity equal radius thats exactly statement mathematical notation think might proof go like start given graph g want build new graph let call h start given graph g ill draw big blob want add two new vertices let call u next want add bunch edge want add every edge u every vertex g edge every vertex g definitely connected graph even g previously disconnected vertex g back one back vertex g completely connected graph point let draw edge generically pink quite done want add two call v v v v add edge though going add edge v u edge two big graph call h connected graph claim g center order see look let start look farthest think carefully eccentricity example obviously get one go one edge vertex graph h one five path length two get one finally one furthest possible vertex away b vertex v hopefully thats clear similarly eccentricity vertex v also symmetric next well look vertex u obviously distance v thats fine farthest vertex away vertex v thats distance check eccentricity vertex thing goes vertex u symmetry finally let take look vertices x x vertex original graph g pair vertices original graph g may may weve added vertices u u know get path length dont know thats going tobe worst possible case vertices v v sure path length vertex x graph g vertex b thats worst case know eccentricity vertices x equal mean us radius graph new graph fact diameter vertices neither center periphery thats fine finally know center new graph equal set vertices eccentricity equal radius case exactly vertices graph g weve proven exactly wan ted weve shown generic graph defined tobe center connected graph defined connected graph hope youve video click check related video sand ill see next time
