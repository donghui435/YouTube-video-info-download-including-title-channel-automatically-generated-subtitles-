video talking find perimeter triangle remember perimeter object distance around edge object imagine around edge around outside far would travel basically thats idea perimeter couple example hereof triangle gon na use theorem find one edge triangle dont know remember use theorem dealing right triangle remember triangle include degree angle first example right triangle include angle thats indicate weve told left leg triangle three length hypotenuse side leg unknown well want find perimeter going need able add sides cant find length unknown side way going theorem remember theorem tell us plus b squared equal c squared say b two leg c length hypotenuse say three one triangle plug gon na get three squared b length unknown leg gon na go ahead leave b squared know length hypotenuse c always hypotenuse go ahead plug seeing hypotenuse simplify going get plus b squared equal sides gon na get b squared equal take square root sides get bis equal say side length equal find perimeter add three together say plus thats going going perimeter triangle second example weve given triangle know length side length side dont know length base going need order find perimeter triangle gon na go finding length base triangle right triangle notice divide triangle two separate left hand side dashed line right triangle know right triangle weve told right angle mean also right angle everything left right triangle everything right right triangle deal separately use theorem find length base add basis together get length total base well able find perimeter let go ahead call side base b sub first base well call b sub second base want find base triangle left everything left dashed line remember well use theorem say one leg going eight well say equal eight well say eight squared plus b sub squared going equal length hypotenuse squared squared simplify well get b sub squared equal subtract sides going get b sub equal square root sides get b sub equal square root say b sub going equal length base triangle right hand side well weve got right triangle use theorem know theorem going equal thats length one leg say plus b sub squared going tobe equal hypotenuse squared case squared going get plus b sub squared equal subtract sides going get take square root sides going get b sub equal square root six know b sub equal want length entire base obviously going add together going give us length base find perimeter take length three sides add together well say plus plus length base found thats going say perimeter triangle
