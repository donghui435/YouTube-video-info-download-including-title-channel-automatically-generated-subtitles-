welcome part one special right triangle video video going go reason cal led special right triangle length longer sides proportional length shorter sides mean let take look length shor test side know length shor test side always going opposite angle let say side shorter side opposite length x know triangle length x hypotenuse going double know hypotenuse going length let take look side thats opposite degree know length shorter side length x length side opposite degree sis going x square root true triangle length sides proportional use information solve special right triangle actually quite easily let get star ted right away example right star ted little easier say angle angle degree know angle degree easy example give us value going opposite value shor test side let say length side equal like know length shor test side triangle equal x know x equal like said also know length hypotenuse double value x equal length shorter side hypotenuse double length hypotenuse equal length side opposite angle equal x square root x square root length side opposite angle completely solve triangle like said easier example let go little bit harder one right example going given length side opposite angle length side opposite angle equal length opposite angle equal x square root x square root equal value length side equal right equation x get rid square root dividing sides square root left hand side square root cancel thing left x right hand side divided square root final answer never square root denominator need rationalize going multiply top bottom square root running space going finish work bottom know x equal square root bottom square root times square root three simplified even cancel know x equal square root three x equal side triangle opposite angle know x square root three side opposite going length square root three know length x easy hypotenuse double two times x two times square root three completely solve triangle hypotenuse times square root shor test side square root side opposite equal hope gave better idea triangle video triangle aswell stay tuned see next one
