wan ted talk use base exponential function special drawn picture graph arbitrary exponential function f x equal b x thats graph purple also drawn tangent line point id like id like explore relationship b slope tangent line order going use geometer see got function g x equal two x actually x change value b value want graph red graph tangent blue right slope point six nine three let move tangent line around notice move tangent line still tangent point move tangent line around move tangent line less steep base get smaller move tangent line base get bigger tangent line negative slope base let take look particular value b equal slope point b slope one point zero nine nine make wonder slope equal two point five two point seven five turns want get slope need b base make thats tangent line slope exactly one zero let summarize discovered b greater one slope tangent line positive b slope slope tangent negative want slope exactly need b equal e e approximately little glimpse make e special let give definition number complicated definition limit n approach es infinity plus n n help understand definition little bit better going calculate expression plus n n ill make little table let start value get plus get anything past need calculator let alright plug plus according calculator approximately two point five nine three seven plug get one plus one hundred power approximately two point seven oh four eight going keep going thousand get going write two point seven one six nine two finally get convergence get n take quite limit limit start getting really close value start getting really close e remember es defined limit expression value heading towards e n goes infinity
