thing actually trinity math society trinity college math society lecture mathematics go pub well society square made square different sizes see one mean unit unit square one square different sizes yet fit together make one big square cal led squared square picked society theyre yeah trinity math student solve one actually possible squared square something like would done ancient something like old problem make square square different sizes like classic problem didnt really turn century surprise integer square square twice theyre cal led imperfect use id rather theyre different sizes four student trinity math society really solve problem cal led stone smith brook bill first three math tut te actually chemistry student math society dont mathematician math society think stone brought problem hear problem thing done couple rectangle found made square snot quite thing two two rectangle nine ten easier making two found far student star ted find method little bit ad ho c trying find would get lucky find square made square chance wasnt working kept trying found rectangle find square thought right going get star ted finding rectangle made thought let star ted extend horizontal like see horizontal line right youve extended gon na turn rectangle network connect two horizontal square touching one touching two horizontal top thats bottom gon na connect actually gon na draw arrow show top bottom mark thats square gon na whole thing network thats top sixteen thats bottom connect line ill mark thats line ill keep going turned network recognize went seem recognize minded electrical network connect battery network wire one unit resistance connect battery potential height rectangle put current flow electrical network suddenly realize connected electrical network sand could use math already could borrow completely solve squared square problem particular cal led law sa couple law current flowing point equal current flowing point let look current flowing flowing flowing weve got total flowing flowing weve got equal another thing learn youve got circuit like circuit circuit make zero ill show mean going youve got weve got make go opposite direction minus together whole circuit math suddenly borrow could solve squared square problem couple thing solve way sho wed squared rectangle square sand theres two actually thats one thats squared rectangle meaning square sand one one done remember two done previously one small squared rectangle sho wed cube thats kind disappointing cant make cube different sizes could find made valid squared rectangle sand valid squared without draw squared star ted build could find squared rectangle another squared rectangle dimension could like squared rectangle like another one completely different square inside theyre mutually exclusive theyre size could join together like would square would square would make squared square automatically cant wouldnt duplicate though want avoid want two squared rectangle square common thats looking maybe could one square common corner square could could rectangle like another one thats meant exactly dimension share one corner would make squared square well plan worked finally found one first squared square massive first one found used square sand star ted improve wan ted find smaller found one used tut te found one used getting better question whats squared square something struggle came hard problem problem left open another computer came along computer could use student method done could use method computer searching squared square sand found definitely unique theres one squared square none use square sand look many student came mathematician swell one came civil servant still math think three came mathematician bill tut te star ted chemistry student swap ped math came park code breaker world war important came proper mathematician pioneer graph theory math network sand credit problem training graph weve seen one squared square dimension actually smaller square tal ked use square theyre unique either three known square size smaller dimension use thing found interesting theoretically one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus four squared imagine consecutive equal toa big number even sure well tell squared mean theoretically possible make square consecutive square one two three four cant done tempting math look like done geometrically dont fit together disappointing know like magic squared square perfect super perfect disappointing doesnt exist favorite squared square say favorite one actually found trinity student found scooped everyone else like nice square tell mat seem excited know excited
