welcome tech math channel going look video way directly really really great way dividing polynomial previous video video youl lever see way long division polynomial way short cut save lots lots work first going write top polynomial well looking say last video example x take away divided x squared plus take k way directly divide polynomial follow binomial polynomial really really simple start way look number basically say number goes many times k x squared divided x x look way getting answer theres nothing going innocence going stay fairly clean get second term dont write anything dont multiply anything actually look minus negative put inverse inverse opposite minus positive k going going get positive going multiply previous answer going add see answer fairly fairly sort thing positive times x plus going put six going see weve already x actually going divide actually going x going forget minute going exhale next answer going without x x power becomes head wait say surely cant wait second think probably need go another one see simple actually ill write next question say one take little bit getting used dont look last one say oh dont get never going able going divide x minus x x take away x power squared plus go plus tape going going get equation going directly divider first going move across bit center go going divide directly going get working first look say x goes x power many times goes x times next answer going x squared answer next one going x power next arrow going excellent remainder part get first look next part look inverse minus positive positive added next term k positive times x cube positive x cube going number minus x cube going end upwith going put go next power squared k thats get next part answer going see going tobe x squared going x power one positive five times squared squared minus squared minus x minus square going tobe power get next part answer five times minus x minus plus positive positive times minus x minus x plus x positive x going put wherever x nu going put pretty good look left way go times going add minus minus sort remainder feeling easiest way rather working would seen video made people video direct way work sok look another example sound ah k well well one let clear ill get rid work one x plus two going divide two x plus x one going utterly enormous plus x plus x squared minus x minus look run line better extend let directly divide first look many times x going x going see goes x power thats first term next one going x power x power x power underneath normal term inverse positive negative minus times x minus x form going add x get x suddenly go power going x power get next term going minus times positive minus x power going add x power minus plus positive power three though going put power x squared next going go minus two x three x squared nearly minus six x squared plus x squared going minus five x squared minus six plus one minus five five x squared going tobe x minus two x minus minus two x minus five x sorry minus ten positive positive plus minus three going next power going x whats remainder going well going minus two x minus three six plus remainder right really really fast way next video going show deal say put two theres slight little trick hope see bye
