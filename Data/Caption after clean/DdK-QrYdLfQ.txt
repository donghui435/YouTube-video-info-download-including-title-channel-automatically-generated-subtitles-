hello name maria miller math mammoth video going study measuring angle watched video hopefully remember sho wed angle raise open two ray two sides angle open like tracing circle arc circle like measure angle people agreed full circle degree angle open let show annual open zero angle goes way would degree goes half way straight movement degree goes much degree right angle measure full circle full circle would degree open less compare much circle drawn compare full circle thats angle measured use protractor measure angle usually half circle marked two set thats usually case one set goes set number start goes way let say want measure know need position vertex angle herein protractor certain point remember zero protractor zero zero line speak protractor might zero line zero actually going find zero line earn zero na da usually little mark maybe little circle something need position vertex mind none know mid point herewith number mid point need position vertex dont need line zero line one ready measuring much angle see arc circle near either need know one right well zero read read lower mine come tad degree mark see individual degree one goes fives marked angle remember need line one zero line doesnt work work yes vertex put exactly middle point like line line imagine angle open right much circle trace go something degree snow let say draw degree angle close side start draw line going one side park buttock going open maybe somewhere like much something like please measuring angle need line zero line vertex correct point like well mark little secretariat use mark draw line like side angle draw hundred fifty five degree angle think going go past somewhere obtuse angle call animal less somewhere obtuse angle mean doll type angle less cal led acute angle think sharp animal sharp point could come know cut doll type animal like optional wont hurt much hit object dolphin draw first start drawing line know angle going going someone right position zero line protractor line drew mid point past way draw mark draw angle angle oh would taste arc circle often mark arc circle little arc circle trace arc circle people market near er verdict like thats triangle measure angle unknown easy angle maybe degree put protractor like read almost degree see next angle student shave difficulty p lacing protractor right know put know tobe lined one sides line like know need remember mid point put vertex like cant see whether side touch measuring angle needs tobe turn like example theres two ways like vertex middle real line oh line zero line side angle like two ways channel like zero line think opening angle open little bit past object go past nineteen hundred hundred ten see might difficult see oh wont work see way yes work acute angle much zero line open sup far zero sorry zero go almost degree probably know angle triangle add degree maybe dont know know might notice dont add plus plus difficult measure accurately get know maybe reality degree rounded maybe degree whatever hard measure accurately dont alarmed know doesnt get exactly
