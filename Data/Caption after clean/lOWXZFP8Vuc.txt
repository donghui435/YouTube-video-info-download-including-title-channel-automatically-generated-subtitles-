three figure three parallel line cant parallel tobe parallel another three equation line equal x minus four line b minus equal negative line c negative plus equal figure parallel compare two slope theyre different different theyre going parallel line easy figure slope already slope intercept form x plus b slope relevant negative let see character kind standard form standard form slope intercept form let see slope line get slope intercept form really easiest one pick slope let sides equation left hand side cancel whole point get equal negative plus divide everything left equal negative x plus case intercept importantly slope negative different guy negative positive definitely arent move guy standard form let get x term let add sides side cancel left equal plus either way divide sides divide every term left hand side left right hand side x plus slope intercept care line line exact theyre different different know c parallel b parallel either one two
