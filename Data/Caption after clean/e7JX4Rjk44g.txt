let plot fraction line negative first one number line tick mark every whole number plot would divide right first halves fourth would halfway point zero one negative side zero equally far away one right like mirror point one days also think divide number line halves fourth five eighth divide eighth divided interval zero negative one eight part negative five eighth know travel positive go way go way five eight one two three four five would negative five eighth one thats positive side one two halfway one know thats easy negative one past negative one negative negative like one would opposite side oka yas mirrored let divide four part go negative one three fourth right negative one let kind number line one negative well actually fraction year need ten part go towards negative one negative two tenth little bit past two tenth number line would first divide ten part actually exact would need divide hundred part cant easily ill go two tenth little bit would negative one point eight would go negative one eight tenth somewhere would divide ten part first go eighth tenth near negative two negative two point zero five little bit little time beyond negative two clear little bit past arrow point nine lastly going look fraction rational every fraction rational number often want express already know lot folk one fourth express decimal maybe remember one fourth dollar cent maybe use equivalent fraction write hundredth either way decimal negative technique write equivalent fraction denominator hundred negative goes times seven times five negative one go evenly two hundred thousand anything remember one third zero point three three three two three two third zero point six six six six six end negative one point six six six negative one point six bar top indicate part course fraction use something maybe remember use equivalent fraction need use division either calculator long division one likely use division use long division way thats right remember five eight five goes inside little corner long division corner gon na single put decimal decimal number goes five several times fifty three times get goes get forty goes two times get anything oh goes even five times negative decimal number thirty well let try thing dividing well put lots decimal dont know terminate like one division point going even oh going division continue indefinitely indefinitely goes times times times going repeat see remainder repeat get one point zero eight three three four put bar three three gon na repeat eight repeat zero unending decimal whenever fraction traditional either get decimal like like get decimal might even repeat fun like symbol decimal dont repeat still go indefinitely without pattern also irrational exist rational would topic another life hope helpful
