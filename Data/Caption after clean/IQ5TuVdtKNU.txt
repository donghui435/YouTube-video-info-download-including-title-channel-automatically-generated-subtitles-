hey going video work finding sign different training metric wonderful neat little tool picked school alright may seen maybe actually great way easily memorize whether something like sine cosine positive negative thats mean sign let learn real quick see exactly information us different trigonometric function like sine get number idea thing going positive negative clue really figure well positive negative depending angle end quadrant one quadrant two quadrant three quadrant four know quadrant going easily figure sine going tell trigger trigonometric function going positive negative example angle end first quadrant trigonometric function going positive dealing sine degree sure enough thats first quadrant oh know thats going positive value get quadrant number two know sine reciprocal going positive rest tangent cosine negative telling value trigonometric function going positive sine reciprocal know well go ahead write cosecant also positive one right moving whose going positive third quadrant well dont one trigonometric function start thats tangent want cotangent one tangent reciprocal last one get positive cosine reciprocal know function swill positive quadrant remember really quickly well great mnemonic student take calculus mark order quadrant quadrant one quadrant two student quadrant three take quadrant four calculus student take calculus know turn associated take one step actually try example wonderful little thing gon na draw corner something taking quick test something know quickly sketch student take calculus well use help us figure whats going goal problem figure quadrant angle ended thing know little bit sine function know plug angle sine negative plug angle tangent turns positive angle go well know sine negative immediately rule first second quadrant first positive second quadrant sine positive specifically know negative got lower half shade far somewhere next bit information tangent positive let see tangent positive well positive first quadrant thats positive third quadrant two could could theres one quadrant thing happening sure enough quadrant number three quadrant angling quadrant three information little hint angle let time cosine negative cosecant positive c cosine negative rule two need negative know side cosine negative cosecant greater zero tobe careful stand sine tangent cosine worse cosecant ko seeing also remember apply cosecant reciprocal sine cosecant angle equal word sine angle gon na use sign sine angle sine positive sine positive upper half let shade upper half right like theres one place condition happen simultaneously know angle theta quadrant number two know dont afraid write piece paper quick reference really lot intuition sign trigonometric right youd like see video please
