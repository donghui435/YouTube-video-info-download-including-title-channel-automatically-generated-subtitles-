whats everyone welcome lesson box whisker experience math student youve come across visually represent ing data pie chart bar graph scatter plot sare example tool ox whisker another method data help us make sense lesson going focus box whisker plot tool thats going help us analyze data first need data let look jordan basketball player varsity last seven season jordan chart keep track number score use performance data plot help us evaluate jordan performance seven game span first step take rearrange order least first piece information get data whats cal led upper represent highest value data set case upper extreme lower extreme next piece information need median know median middle data set work outside get middle value case final piece information need whats upper lower quartile snow think splitting data set median upper lower region upper quartile median upper region three know lower quartile median lower region three know ten say upper quartile lower quartile information need construct box whisker plot going start number line fit sour data mark upper lower extreme five well median value value upper example imagine taking point elevating number line first step construct two upper use construct rectangular box median point median point construct line represent box box whisker plot final step draw horizontal connect upper quartile upper extreme lower quartile lower extreme notice graph broken four represent ing hole probably thinking use graph basketball performance example looking extreme could see probably unrealistic expect jordan average game score anything near high low point extreme may think jordan inconsistent player look area inside box cal led inter quartile range say average game jordan score point coach use information whether jordan starting line bench come also use box whisker compare jordan performance performance let extend understanding areal world example going join jess coffee shop keeping data number express law make per remember first step value order least ready get information need first well start extreme upper extreme lower extreme median moving outside find middle value add divide sum two divided two equal median example notice median split kind draw line two value find upper quartile find median upper value thats find lower quartile thing lower value case information need construct box whisker plot always first step construct number line data well start point upper lower quartile well construct point well use construct box vertical constructor rectangle draw another vertical line going plot point sat two extreme lower extreme upper extreme construct horizontal plot complete ready visually analyze data thanks lot guy please follow us mash map daily math math sports check
