welcome another episode fort bend mathematics tutor ing take moment soothe cant hurt nobody hello ladies gentleman fort bend tutor ing multiplying right two term times two term sand example format basically time two set parentheses two within use two different strategi es order solve one use favorite distributive property meaning got arrow thats arrow would end multiplying first term times second set parentheses would multiply second term also term second set parentheses therefore would end upwith following product would end times c plus times plus b times c plus b times thats simply term first set parentheses times everything second set parentheses prefer however simplified process way defined following say could multiply first term together meaning c term multiply outer term together meaning times multiply inner term b times cand finally last term set parentheses meaning b times aka foil method preferably simply distributive property foil method something extra learn thing thats right distributive property multiplying times c times b times c b times exact thing foil method ladies student please understand aswell learning foil method dont want learn f oh l stand simply multiply everything fine fine right let show first problem problem number one quantity x minus times x plus going first foremost get arrow right know ill multiplying x times term second set parentheses well taking negative multiplying times term well ill end upwith following result x times x x squared x times notice circled negative second term first set parentheses negative keep right well negative times give negative finally negative times negative love foil method exact thing multiply first term together meaning x times x multiply outer term meaning x times multiply inner term negative x finally multiply second term set parentheses negative get negative keep mind looking searching term term sare always separate plus first set parentheses first term x second term negative second set parentheses first term x term positive finish always look see combine like term notice middle term negative x first power meaning making let add together ill bring x squared minus give positive finally id bring positive done thats got gon na put ared box around answer thats like always thats process multiplying binomial right like right know think want switch let pull one right go p roud number two following x minus times plus gon na start getting arrow gon na circle second term negative wont forget finally ill start multiplying times give times next ill negative times give negative x negative negative finished multiplying answer descending order x meaning gon na start term highest exponent work way ever concerned order put term always write answer descending order variable less right let bring squared ill combining middle term together meaning negative x give negative x ill bring negative thats answer gon na put red box around got let keep going right next problem quantity x minus times minus gon na give arrow thats right get arrow pop ladies gentle men reim gon na multiply x times squared x times negative negative next negative times x negative x also negative negative remember negative times negative positive ill end positive last term remember next thing combine like term thats right look term added together middle term negative negative combined ill squared see like sign add alright keep sign biggest term bring negative sign unlike science attract always keep sound ill positive right thats answer let put box around problem number minus plus ill ill right get arrow gon na second term negative right wont always negative time second term negative sign prefer remind negative circle around right times squared next times multiplying times give negative times negative notice distribute combine like term may two middle term like term also additive inverse meaning theyre one trying equal zero twelve eighty cancel right theyre gone end squared minus type binomial minus cal led difference square difference two ever want figure factor word get back original alright minus times plus go ahead check video difference square ladies gentle men alright multiplying one factor ing need lesson check alright ill put description box alright good deal thats problem number right next check alright problem number quantity squared time one term inside set parentheses exponent outside repeat distribute exponent inside parentheses cant mathematically correct instead mean binomial minus three raised second power meaning times minus thats right quantity minus second power meaning multiplying must expand word first step binomial squared expand look like previous problem dealing multiplying binomial times binomial mean apply distributive property foil gon na get got get let go ahead multiply times give squared times negative negative negative negative finally negative times negative give positive right time finish always look see combine term exact variable exact exponent variable right bring squared right ill end negative positive done right saying dont like ill fix right dont know better right therefore better four squared minus twelve plus nine result thats alright let go ahead put box around next let look around number six problem number six another binomial squared binomial going expand multiplying plus times yea plus thats gon na first step see problem distribute exponent inside parenthesis right proper way going go ahead multiply everything get let forget get arrow finally second term positive right times give times x notice variable alphabetical order always identify like term ill times give x finally times gon na give positive squared done going attempt combine like term may identify like term term exact exact exponent son variable thats exactly middle term combine ill squared together positive x finally positive squared last term answer thats alright check next problem right problem number seven quantity minus times ill gon na start getting second term negative well making sure know second term negative starting gon na multiply give squared times give positive x multiplying negative times give negative finally negative times give negative squared alright next gon na combine middle term gon na write answer descending order x starting term highest exponent x variable first term squared combining x minus end positive x ill negative thats gon na answer thats done done prime number seven like last problem ladies problem number problem number plus times x minus c see happen problem right got going distribute term second set parentheses multiplying squared times x end x cube remember exponent like bases add x squared x first power plus give x third power variable ill multiplying x squared times negative z give squared z notice writing variable alphabetical order thats know rest right gon na multiply three z give positive x z right purpose writing variable alphabetical order help identify like term finished multiplying please every time well multiplying times negative z negative distribute always look see like four gentle men notice every term different combination variable dont identical variable exact variable theyre different first term x cube second term x squared z third term x z last term z squared none four term like term answer wont able add combine alright final result well ladies fort bend tutor ing multiplying binomial always please comment rate subscribe ladies gentle men please donate help us bring alright take care certainly hope today mathematic presentation learn anything need review take deep breath congratulate learning mathematical
