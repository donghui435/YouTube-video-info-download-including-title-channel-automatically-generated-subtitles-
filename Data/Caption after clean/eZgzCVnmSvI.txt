hello welcome example want find slant asymptote rational function one thing might go mind know slant asymptote well one way tell whether slant actually compare power top power bottom power top exactly bottom know must slant asymptote see example power top versus power bottom top bottom actually find slant asymptote go long division process basically record quotient going cube plus x squared plus x minus represent top polynomial going divide squared plus x minus x good idea make sure everything let actually go division process squared times would equal cube well squared x squared times x give well multiply subtract away new polynomial times squared times minus minus good want subtract away see give us cube minus gone zero minus zero like zero minus negative ill become positive right look pretty good point power less dividing polynomial represent remainder really showing run division process get plus remainder still divided squared minus quotient part got slant asymptote going come fact could say equation land always look quotient looking slant asymptote youd like see visit
