welcome video standard deviation standard deviation fancy way saying far apart close together data set let take look data set black took average mean data set added together divided five would get average probably could looking took look data set blue right took average mean data set added divided also loo ked data set would think theyre exactly average clearly looking know true black much closer together mean blue black number number average data blue number number much farther away average since data blue much farther apart standard deviation data set black thats brief introduction get star ted right away example let pick easy let say first thing like find standard deviation find average data set thats right average always write x equal together plus plus plus got divided total amount five five data set divide five equal three next thing like find average make table left column table like put value x right hand side table like value x minus average x bar like square left hand side value x going value data point data right hand side table column put x minus x bar first row x value equal x bar average squared second row x value minus x bar average square third row x value average need square x value need subtract need square fifth row x value x bar need square simplify row first row minus negative squared positive second row minus negative negative squared positive third row squared minus squared equal fourth row positive positive squared also positive row minus squared squared equal add value right hand side table plus plus plus equal summation value right hand side table equal going write notation summation value x minus average x bar square summation equal going use value standard deviation formula bring next point standard deviation formula depend talking sample population talking formula usually written standard deviation equal square root summation x minus x bar squared divided n minus n total amount data point talking population formula standard deviation written letter sigma really similar sample formula equal square root numerator exactly summation x minus x bar divided n instead n minus k many people get confused formula need use let take look data set let say sample population small sample large population need use first formula let plug plug everything first formula standard deviation would square root summation know equal divided n minus n equal minus plug calculator rounded would get decimal one point five eight standard deviation sample would one point five eight let assume five represent population need find standard deviation wed touse second formula square root summation x squared know ten divided n know five plug calculator would get approximate answer rounded two decimal point one point five entire population standard deviation would one point four one hope gave better idea standard deviation really next video going talk curve use standard deviation make bell curve really hope enjoying tutorial see next one
