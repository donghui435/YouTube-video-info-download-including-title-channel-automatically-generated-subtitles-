example going find focus directrix parabola equal times x squared way going kind approach problem way think kind want write equation certain form going try write form x well times p times well hey theres p really say get x squared whatever coefficient front well sort rewrite times number p get coefficient point get p value turns line equal negative p going directrix directrix say focus type parabola focus going point p trying form hopefully little bit useful k let try weve got equal times x squared well x squared going multiply sides right times would give us left squared well times weve almost got form maybe ill ordered going write x squared equal obviously dont going make look almost exactly like idea say whatever front thats going value going rewrite say four times number equal five two well say need solve p say four times number going equal well five two right solve p multiply sides one left side fourth times four leave us p five times one five two times four eight hey weve p value weve done hard work say directrix parabola say directrix equal negative thats directrix say focus parabola zero comma zero comma weve got weve got solution technically done know always like think little bit think graph ing parabola equal x squared well x squared upwards going change know bending little bit general thats kind rough sketch parabola x squared say directrix kind behind parabola five eight certainly seem reasonable say sour focus point also seem reasonable know would kind quick way intuitively make sure didnt make maybe sign mistake maybe didnt switch incorrectly little thing like though thats kind know think story really sort remember ing write form well kind know little associated procedure
