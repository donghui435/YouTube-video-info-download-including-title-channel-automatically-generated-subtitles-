welcome fun result latest earth mathematician following take equilateral triangle choose point like inside triangle let call pand measure three perpendicular distance sides distance bottom side distance b left side distance c right side plus b let see similar three distance claim always matter point choose inside triangle point three distance plus b value previous case bit since distance sum always equal height triangle briefly prove thats true well talk goes possibly true well let take point pand whoops vomiting use calculate area triangle following way original point p ill use messy diagram let assume triangle side length x let scall height triangle h course could work eight year exponent leave like moment right one way work near triangle divide triangle three piece funky little piece shade triangle bait x height area half x second piece base x height c half c x remain ing piece mainly triangle base x height b half b x area triangle ax plus b x plus c x could worked ear triangle punch looking whole thing triangle base x height h also x h well ear area two different ways must equal equality valid multiply divided x left plus b plus c must height triangle matter point p initially inside triangle grand well sort fun thing ask need stick triangle let point p wander outside wouldnt devilish us let ecological triangle suppose time chose point p say lie still measure three perpendicular distance bottom one first side one length b length b left side height distance length third side see claim matter b p plus b minus c height triangle well said matter supposed little bit careful first actually follow exactly proof work area two triangle two different ways ill trick could work area piece half x base times height could work area piece plus base x height b area amount need subtract half x times c would area triangle x h well allow subtract actually generalize resort get least region outside triangle constant value speed season height triangle well let little precisely mean whereabouts outside triangle go need ill leave verify detail synthesize triangle following theres one side second side third side sho wed middle triangle plus b plus c constant plus b minus c constant minus b plus c constant region plus b minus c constant one region like one plus b minus c constant ill leave figure whats going whats going guess going one positive two negative theres theres theorem taking outside triangle ill give additional piece homework statistic equilateral version theorem take point inside square guess kind obvious perpendicular distance plus b plus c plus going constant well point wan ted outside square although work regular pentagon regular hexagon size value n whats perfect generalization well like lot right thanks much
