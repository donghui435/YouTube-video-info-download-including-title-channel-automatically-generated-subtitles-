video talking solve radical equation two really important thing remember radical first always trying radical equation onto side equation want isolate square sides equation square asquare root two thing cancel another left whats inside square root thats going eliminate square root sign equation order solve variable second thing need remember always double check solution find equation dealing radical equation optional thing whatever find radical equation may actually satisfy original equation always double check make sure solution solution truly valid first example square root x minus outside square root minus equal know equation equal sign know radical equation radical square root involved process going try isolate square root order well add sides equation cancel negative positive left leave x minus square root x minus equal plus right get two cancel weve isolated square root square root isolated want go ahead square sides equation remember whatever one side equation order keep equation balanced said square asquare root two thing cancel leaving us whatever inside square root case x minus right hand side get times thats solve x go ahead add sides equation get negative positive cancel left leaving us x equal potential solution equation order verify actual solution must plug back original equation make sure equation true plugging x equal back original equation get square root minus equal get square root minus equal square root get minus equal equal check mean x equal fact valid solution radical equation let look second example square root x plus x equal going isolate square root side equation order well subtract x sides equation get positive x negative x cancel leaving us square root x plus equal negative x square root salute go ahead square sides equation like square square root get two thing cancel leaving whats inside square root get x plus equal negative x times negative x careful negative remember two negative x negative x times negative x like multiply two negative together cancel positive x times x x squared get x squared need nonzero term one side get equation equal way well want keep x squared term positive whenever going subtract x subtract sides minus x minus get positive x negative x cancel positive negative cancel thats going leave us left right well get x squared minus x minus standard trinomial factor going say equal x minus times x plus want double check make sure factor correctly say x times x give us x squared plus anda minus give us minus x minus x thats right negative positive negative get back negative six correctly trinomial use zero theorem solve x remember zero theorem tell us p times q equal zero either equal zero q equal reason know thats true course p times q equal zero order make equation true either p must equal zero get zero q equal zero zero q equal zero get zero p equal zero zero way equation true p equal zero q equal zero well compare zero theorem formula equation saying p basically factor x minus q factor x plus equation really p times q equal like zero theorem formula tell us factor set equal individually set x equal set x plus well get x equal positive sides subtract ing sides get x equal negative potential solution original equation remember always back original equation make sure theyre actual solution let start plug back original equation going get square root plus plus equal plus equal get square root plus equal square root plus equal true equal mean x equal actual solution radical equation let try x equal negative going get square root negative plus get plus negative minus equal plus thats square root equal get minus equal equal check x equal negative fact real solution radical equation thats perfect illustration always always always must check answer back original equation find always going satisfy original equation case x equal loo ked like potential solution didnt turn actual solution negative solution radical equation
