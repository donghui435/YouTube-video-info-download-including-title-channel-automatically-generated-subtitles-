hi welcome math antic sin video going learn special kind polygon cal led fancy math word polygon exactly sides one recognize shape course square square special kind quadrilateral quadrilateral sides special sides exactly length angle exactly fact right also square formed two pair parallel sides two opposite sides parallel two opposite sides parallel l l see important square important type quadrilateral going make square see type quadrilateral two thing change sides start sides let stretch square one direction pair sides longer pair call rectangle rectangle quadrilateral still equal angle notice square angle n change equal sides notice like square rectangle made two pair parallel sides alright rectangle going back square instead sides change angle like ah cal led rhombus rhombus quadrilateral equal sides equal angle sand like square rectangle rhombus made two pair parallel going back square try sides end call parallelogram cal led parallelogram even though sides equal angle equal still made two pair parallel sides get parallel parallelogram wait second definition parallelogram quadrilateral two pair parallel sides would n parallelogram like quadrilateral sit special angle equal rectangle sides equal rhombus sides angle equal quadrilateral v e seen far example example parallelogram well see one let start square time going change moving one like one pair sides still parallel quadrilateral one pair parallel sides cal led trapezoid well actually quadrilateral get little messy sort shape cal led trapezoid cal led trapezium trapezoid trapezoid least start word trap ye tokay quadrilateral trapezoid trapezium one pair parallel sides parallel couple example quadrilateral one set parallel sides alright quadrilateral parallel sides like one opposite sides parallel opposite sides parallel either call kind polygon ah really part sometimes cal led trapezium n call quadrilateral one pair parallel sides unfortunately word used describe two different thing two different trapezium trapezium well least like football keep thing clear math antic going call quadrilateral parallel sides trapezium think needs special going call quadrilateral summarize polygon exactly four sides cal led quadrilateral parallel sides still call quadrilateral one one pair parallel sides call trapezoid trapezium two pair parallel sides call parallelogram v e already seen several type parallelogram scalled rectangle rhombus es basic special type quadrilateral v e learned important theres one really important thing need know need know sum angle quadrilateral always degree snow pretty obvious square rectangle right angle sand since know right angle degree times give us see also true quadrilateral let look different example swatch happen draw line pair opposite vertices quadrilateral got divided two triangle sin triangle video learned sum angle triangle always hard see since angle quadrilateral form triangle sum times degree angle quadrilateral add degree scan help solve problem like one quadrilateral told angle fourth one unknown find unknown angle add three angle know subtract total know unknown angle look one unknown angle problem little tricky problem ask us find unknown angle parallelogram look like told us one angle unknown possibly figure one solve problem need know important fact parallelogram always made pair parallel sides mean also equal angle opposite angle form example parallelogram angle c equal opposite corner sand angle b equal opposite corner snow remember true parallelogram work thing like problem even though given measure one angle since know parallelogram need figure know angle b must also degree opposite angle must equal next know two angle c must also equal figure many degree left still unknown divide amount equally c well total angle subtract angle know c must half degree sand divided angle must video v e learned basic quadrilateral sand learned quadrilateral angle add getting good math take practice sure work exercise section always thanks watching math antic l l see ya next time learn
