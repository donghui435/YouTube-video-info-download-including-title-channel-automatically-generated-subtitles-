like show piecewise function going need understand reveal piecewise function afunction inside function two function make sit lot thing got ta remember one function call constraint meaning true defined certain amount value function know input output defined whatever input want get output get one unique output defined value well theyre saying constraint piecewise function telling graph defined true use input value x less equal negative plug great less equal negative let see could function true greater equal actually gon na even draw could actually x squared plus one look right minus seven one two three four five six seven let pretend thats x squared like thats x squared plus would look something like right well gon na say one two three four theyre saying graph true axes less negative four less negative four less four graph going look like greater four graph take overkind look like really find path kind similar least way drew dont know make much closer sense let see gon na go eight let say wan ted evaluate f negative three f negative function going f negative true true x value remember x negative true less equal negative gon na plug function well negative times positive plus equal want f absolute greater gon na plug function six times six minus going right make sure understand constraint value plug value determine want plug value evaluate piecewise function
