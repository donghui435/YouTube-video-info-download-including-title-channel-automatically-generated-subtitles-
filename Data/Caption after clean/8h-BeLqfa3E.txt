let try get similar two similar triangle triangle vertices vertices p q r triangle similar else two similar triangle convey tell us sides well quite lot would say first let look sides always corresponding sides proportion based b correspond side p q b p q similarly side b c correspond q r side c correspond site r p corresponding sides proportion mean ratio corresponding sides equal ratio p q equal ratio b c q r equal ratio c r p b p q r corresponding sides b c q corresponding sides c r p corresponding sides actually mean mean side scaled scaled factor factor bis increase get p q factor p c increase get q r factor c increase get r p remember triangle similar corresponding sides always proportion let get triangle always shape tell us yes measure similar triangle equal based angle correspond angle p angle b correspond angle q angle c correspond angler angle congruent angle p also written measure equal measure angle pit mean take protractor measure two angle angle b congruent angle q angle c congruent angle r triangle similar corresponding angle equal deduce given two triangle similar given triangle similar triangle similar sine read triangle similar triangle actually also works way around condition say triangle similar remember either condition pair corresponding sides proportion sure triangle similar even told equal sure similar
