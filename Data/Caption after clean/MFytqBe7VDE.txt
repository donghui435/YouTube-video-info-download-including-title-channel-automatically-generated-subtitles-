welcome id like explain trigonometry one trigonometry deal aright triangle may interested particular angle x call side opposite angle opposite side hypotenuse longe st side triangle set already name hypotenuse side adjacent angle call adjacent taught memorize usually three four sometimes six example taught sine x defined opposite hypotenuse cosine x adjacent hypotenuse tangent x scalled opposite adjacent let see thats three six possible ratio could hypotenuse opposite scalled cosecant x strange could hypotenuse adjacent thats cal led secant x could also adjacent opposite thats cal led cotangent x wonderful history sine got name mistranslation translate translate mean harbor place boat strange story agency volume five text cosine well actually make sense name cosine comes angle x defined opposite hypotenuse complementary angle ninety minus x sine adjacent hypotenuse pa til actually sine complementary angle hence name cosine sense companion design tangent one ill explain would opposite typical tangent geometry touch line something strange name secant geometry line circle k u secant companion line cotangent guess really want explain video secant tangent cotangent really need go trigonometry really actually right triangle really trying figure position circle comes astronomy way back beginning mankind would say world live notice would always rise east great big well look like circular arc way around bad circle hour slater rise east west rise follow motion idea could look star certain angle call angle x interested whats height star came known sine x root angle tail chapter tail fabulous length came known cosine x well theres one problem story dont know radius circle moving along make mathematics work race radio radius possible assumed dealing radius case defined silent cosine different way assign height star radius cosine star radius really opposite adjacent go look sine right triangle would opposite hypotenuse think something wrong thing moment sine x sine x yep opposite partner really sine x adjacent hypotenuse really cosine x right ratio well going add picture circle know talk position star circle going tangent line segment theres group tangent line segment green let continue trial bigger triangle let see workout length cal led h tangent line well actually going big green triangle base green well whose height h divide base whats circle radius one base one must ratio smaller red triangle x degree principally strong er similar must ratio height little triangle sine x base little triangle cosine x height tangent line sine x cosine x hence call quantity tangent x like sine opposite hypotenuse cosine adjacent little bit algebra really indeed opposite adjacent hence name tangent theres another quantity picture drew green line hypotenuse green triangle cutting circle thats usually cal led line let see work length longer ratio hypotenuse big green triangle l compare big green triangle one ratio hypotenuse little red triangle base little red triangle cosine x l turns tobe cosine x well call secant x secant x go really adjacent hypotenuse one flip fraction really ratio hypotenuse seem appropriate call ratio partner adjacent secant related secant line picture well make sense say something like hypotenuse opposite companion quantity secant let call cosecant guess companion tangent way around observer call adjacent opposite cotangent yeah theres messy screen right basically sine x cosine x length tangent line segment picture height one cosine x really length secant line segment secant tangent look video squire wine fun theyll think tank squeak go thanks much
