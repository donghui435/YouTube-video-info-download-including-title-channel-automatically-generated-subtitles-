hey everyone thank stopping lesson going teach graph quadratic function without graph ing calculator welcome back everyone let start question usual whats deal quadratics answer question something already know graph ing linear equation equation equal x plus b form call linear function instead equal would f super important understand f x mean thing represent output wan ted graph linear function fill table f x equal plus start intercept positive one put point point use slope positive positive use rise run going find point could go find point would get commute one time get point also go opposite direction find point connect point construct ing line pretty easy function starting point intercept use slope build line fill table construct graph want extend understanding function develop strategy graph ing quadratic function form ax squared plus b x plus c example let replace b c coefficient five also notice gon na drop going include actual function f x equal x squared minus four x plus five thats want graph also familiar fact quadratic function curve cal led parabola function intercept important point could build quadratic function important point vertex turning point find point graph parabola quick reference could take function put equal calculator would thinking would fill table value would table value plot point starting vertex case provided table value plot rest vertex allow graph parabola say know vertex build parabola graph quadratic function let take step explore grab dragging without calculator let go ahead revisit last example f x squared minus plus thats function want graph order need table first thing want find vertex function find formula may may familiar negative b formula finding axis symmetry parabola let explore let replace b formula b term quadratic negative negative negative positive denominator times know term replace finally divided axis symmetry x equal know x equal equation vertical line equation case positive axis symmetry line goes vertex parabola dont know parabola know positive x vertex need find still unknown however know x figured equal original going replace x evaluate times squared times negative bring positive plus evaluate x core vertex plot point quickly recap found vertex parabola first axis symmetry formula x equal negative b find value vertex plug x value original function get output value vertex full point know vertex better idea final graph going look like still need find rest point value going build vertex value instance want find value x replace x original function evaluate case would add plus evaluate positive x another point parabola going go ahead plot point go ahead find another pointlet say want find value x zero ill replace x original function evaluate get positive another point easily repeat process remain ing find point graph filled table value plot remain ing point graph oh cool try one example want graph quadratic f x equal x squared minus minus without calculator remember first thing want find vertex parabola build want use axis symmetry formula x equal negative b going fill evaluate place b negative negative positive denominator replace value case times finally divided equal vertex positive going use value positive plug find value remember f x equal equal mean thing rewrite function equal form replace x swith evaluate negative times negative bring negative minus equal negative vertex found vertex go ahead plot point next go ahead fill x value table value bygoing x value vertex ready find point parabola x negative replace original function negative evaluate case would plus minus evaluate positive negative positive another point negative graph repeat process remain ing substituting whatever output value point table value plot graph construct parabola graph quadratic function without calculator quick recap whenever want graph quadratic function without use calculator start finding vertex point x equal negative b formula find x original function get value find point plugging original function plotting point table construct ing graph thats practice think understand concept addition procedure well catch next time thanks guy video dont know awesome awesome really awesome page nash map thats first thing weever star ted really cool sports math post daily kind study tip tip tip like artistic colorful vibrant cool check see next time
