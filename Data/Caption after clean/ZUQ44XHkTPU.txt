one four main type point concurrency find triangle circumcenter point least three one spot circumcenter three perpendicular bisector side intersect also make center circle circumscribed triangle take look circumcenter might look like notice could really big circle obtuse triangle three vertices mean center equidistant three vertices ever apply real life well common problem might see test give different point treasure treasure equal distance three random point maybe tree stump gravestone beach would find treasure would find circumcenter triangle drawing would erased treasure would draw three sides triangle compass would construct three perpendicular bisector side would one perpendicular bisector would another perpendicular bisector estimate show would solve problem youd find perpendicular bisector ideally definition point sare concurrent see little bit thats sketching would say treasure would right center circle three vertices
