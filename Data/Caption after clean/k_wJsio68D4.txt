previous video explore dhow cosine angle relate essentially take terminal ray angle reflect x axis axes want video think little bit tangent different little bit reminder know tangent theta equal sine angle cosine angle unit circle definition essentially saying slope terminal ray right remind slope rise change vertical axis change horizontal axis starting origin change vertical axis go zero sine theta well change vertical axis sine theta change horizontal axis cosine theta change change x terminal ray tangent theta sine theta cosine theta could view slope ray right think angle going exact tangent theta ray collinear ray right herein fact put together get line tangent angle right pink angle going way around tangent pi plus theta tangent theta plus pi obviously could write theta plus pi instead pi plus theta based slope argument equal tangent see actually case two thing equal agree tangent angle equal slope terminal ray course side angle going positive x axis convention weve set think tangent theta plus pi term sine cosine let write pink color tangent thats pink tangent pi plus theta thats going equal parentheses avoid ambiguity thats equal sine pi plus theta theta plus pi cosine theta plus previous video established sine theta plus pi thats thing negative sine theta equal negative sine theta cosine theta plus pi already established thats thing negative cosine theta negative divided negative could say negative cancel left sine theta cosine theta indeed tangent theta feel pretty good point terminal ray right think point tangent negative theta going know tangent negative theta thing sine negative theta cosine negative theta already established sine negative theta thats negative sine theta see right sine negative theta thats negative thats opposite sine theta cosine negative theta thing cosine theta thing left negative sine theta cosine theta thing equal negative tangent theta see take negative going get negative tangent thats sine numerator definition sign denominator tangent negative theta thing negative tangent theta point right well relative theta looking pi minus theta looking tangent pi minus theta thats sine pi minus theta cosine pi minus theta already established previous video sine pi minus theta equal sine theta see right exact equal sine theta cosine pi minus theta well opposite cosine theta negative cosine theta going equal negative sine cosine negative tangent theta make sense ray slope ray right see slope could view negative tangent theta see looking two combine ray negative slope theyre mirror image across x axis weve seen take angle add pi angle tangent wont change going essentially sitting line pi everything degree going degree going opposite direction slope ray tangent theta tangent theta plus pi take negative angle going get negative tangent go take pi minus angle also going get negative tangent hopefully make little useful trying work though trigonometric try find relationship even trying use prove essentially weve done proven really helpful think within unit circle
