video going taking look volume known pretty common thing tested p cal c b test generally free response section probably going like part one free response general going find volume solid whose perpendicular x axis b area cross section going integrate area cross section looking picture like x squared standard parabola say got region bo kay region going base solid solid going three dimensionally going base solid take right maybe cross section asquare semicircle right triangle cross section shape different sizes based links curve going integrate area better see visually right hopefully picture showup pretty good got equal x squared curve right right one see sizes square change perpendicular x axis region r base everything going look like semicircle right would bunch cross section also different sizes right depending far curve x axis show show right triangle choose pretty much geometric shape calculate area thats general dealing first example right let say weve got region r region r base put red really need focus base solid bounded curve equal x equal x plus solid perpendicular x axis isosceles right triangle thats major part need zone us find volume first thing probably need little sketch k going equal x squared equal x squared going put straight line goes two rough estimate slope one right alright thats x plus right region section right thats solid going growing three dimensional shape right cross section sare going isosceles going able draw three dimensionally well gon na look like k gon na go ahead put little representative rectangle right alright would represent one cross section right three dimensionally first one let look k x squared theres straight line representative rectangle right take lay tried draw laying straight line line right back x second curve curve right picture laying x axis axis going back isosceles right triangle note alright distance one distance even though going able ten wouldnt take time try draw lane youve wrap head around fact draw two lane like youve got recognize going one leg isosceles right triangle side equal side find distance two curve sand subtract ing two nice little right youve got sketch right let even add gon na length leg thats gon na length one leg first thing going going integrate gon na integrate area write generic little formula gon na gon na integrate area cross section gon na general formula want follow right start area formula gon na look like area isosceles right triangle right well first triangle base times height right isosceles right triangle going exact thing right b h exact thing could say since kind make sense would like height right use h right really times height one half h going formula going integrate distance right length one leg thats h gon na find h find distance right well subtract top curve minus bottom curve pick random number plug top curb thats going give entire distance pick plug bottom curve thats going give little tiny distance right two whats going give distance could even little bit would whatever top curve minus bottom curve quantity squared right thats got integrate also find intersection right would point intersection would point right find point setting two let right point intersection cause running go little bit farther go right going set equal x squared equal x plus going move everything left solve x x squared minus x minus factor pretty easily us x x make negative two plus look going intersection point x equal negative x equal negative know know got top curve bottom curve squared going area formula going integrate setting integral volume equal integral negative top curve minus bottom curve right top curve x plus minus bottom curve minus x squared quantity squared right x point problem like integration problem could calculator could hand might want simplify maybe little bit pull integrate negative one two maybe rearrange look like polynomial curve theyre squared x right point might want pause video see integrate hand integrate calculator get done right end final answer one quick example showing emphasize right reading gon na look base solid going look shape always going area shape focus shape gon na able draw picture laying base visualize distance two curve right going distance need doesnt make difference whether isosceles right triangle whether square still going one side square change semicircle distance right would bottom semicircle would would drawn well would diameter semicircle distance two curve going distance need area formula going come area formula figure deal come intersection able set integral definitely thanks watching busy video please dont forget subscribe channel thanks
