previously loo ked basic study different type look quadrilateral quadrilateral pair opposite sides parallel b parallel c pair sides non parallel ad b care non parallel sides kind quadrilateral one pair opposite sides parallel cal led trapezium sometimes non parallel sides equal quadrilateral would look something like b parallel c ad equal b c two sides equal non parallel trapezium cal led isosceles trapezium remember trapezium one pair parallel sides pair non parallel non parallel sides equal colin isosceles trapezium let look another type quadrilateral scalled kite know something like draw look like let b c vertices kite two sides equal two sides equal one adjacent pair another pair adjacent sides say kite adjacent sides always equal first pair sides equal b second pair equal length c b c also say opposite sides kite unequal equal b c b equal c trapezium kite cover type quadrilateral coming video
