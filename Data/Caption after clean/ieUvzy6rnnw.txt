solar eclipse absolute delight behold going show mathematics behind predict theyre going recording eclipse dont worry information giving remain valid least next nine hundred eighty five may moon transparent mean block light sun cast shadow occasion shadow move across earth standing shadow witness total solar eclipse point view moon move front sun completely blocked light solar eclipse work moon big enough block sun believe diagram scale reality moon times smaller sun fantastic approximately three hundred eighty nine times close average thats close enough mean point view moon almost exactly size sun sky mean line completely block disc sun moon smaller away wouldnt big enough point view cause total solar course could bigger could closer would still fantastically apparent size moon apparent size sun photosphere bright surface sun blocked bulk light sun doesnt block sun thank atmosphere see photograph taken total solar eclipse sun faint atmosphere fantastic structure normally swam ped coming rest sun eclipse line well ever get see incredibly lucky point view size moon match es exactly size sun mean probability happening literally may look like sun moon move around randomly sky occur based earth moon system earth sum moon around earth come alignment bring moon sun earth get solar eclipse although point course diagram way scare fact theres pretty much nothing video thats scale illustrate happen solar eclipse earth going sun line sight sunlight coming face whichever part body shoot sun earth except course white around earth cause eclipse moon earth every days get solar eclipse every days minute simple course physics simple theres actually one type lunar month poor exactly orbit start moon doesnt go around earth circle actually follow ellipse mean different moon different distance plant close st point kilometer away earth distance month three days thats time moon take point close st sun back close st sun different month five days thats time moon take close st point earth back close st point earth difference almost two days reason two day discrepancy elliptical shape orbit movie five day lap around earth earth sun gone degree orbit even though moon back point relative earth longer point relative sun go little bit go sun earth thats expert two days comes always amount time oons elliptical orbit track earth direction pointing relative sun different point sin year take less time moon go sun earth time gave three days thats average factor elliptical orbit moon earth goes around sun calculate often moon goes sun earth unfortunately simple yep third type lunar month son earth earth around fixed man however around earth different plane orbit til ted degree earth orbit around sun dont get eclipse every single month moon going earth sun well either going earth coming back third type lunar month amount time moon going earth orbit get back days yet explain eclipse rare get fact average solar eclipse per century weve got everything sorted calculate unfortunately elliptical orbit around earth doesnt stay still either actually drift point degree every year every eight point eight five orbit two point earth drift around earth course eight point eight five year sand moon goes earth sun one nodal point also earth sun get solar eclipse unfortunately simple second unfortunately simple theres much take account earth orbit course thats circle lip well lip also move every thousand year us gravity nice tidy know start earth perfect sphere oblate top covered water title drag everything theres gravity moon sun far already take account gravity sun year separately earth moon course gravitational pull moon sun fact mutual gravitational attraction sun moon twice earth moon direction moon traveling relative sun make big difference speed constantly fact every single number given video every direction every speed every angle every time theyre approximation average whole system constantly wonder eclipse mean cant make meaningful proper long term solar eclipse reasonably near future gone year negative positive three thousand analyze lunar month thats new moon new moon checked eleven thousand eight hundred put data web site undrained watching happening back random movement sun moon sky occasionally happen cross chaos another cosmic coincidence step forward save date like apparent size happen match sun apparent size one special combination three different type luna happen line perfectly take three new moon month close st sun close st sun compare month close st point earth close st point earth compare two month moon goes earth orbit back win next goes earth three pretty much exactly length time come spot year days eight hour sand mean random movement somehow know year days eight later integer number different type month bold return pretty much exactly geometry another similar eclipse year days eight cal led cycle allow us predict eclipse going happen reasonably near future except course unfortunately simple thanks welcome twenty second lucky enough witness total solar eclipse moon shadow came across pacific ocean japan china saros cycle know enjoy next equivalent clips year days eighth time look like year august second except eight third day wont line everything else earth spun another third rotation actually happen another cycle later august another third rotation across go cycle also worked backwards eclipse one notice time actually working way planet slight mismatch saros cycle rotation elliptical orbit around earth mean eclipse gradually drift north particular cycle cycle actually fourteenth june year day eclipse right near south pole gradually working way across planet last one occur thirtieth year two thousand six hundred twenty two right north pole currently active cycle working way math solar eclipse absolute mess really however know solar eclipse amazing watch go see one course safe dont blind bear mind theyre gon na around forever partly moon gradually moving away title drag centimeter throw away earth every year mean point six billion year far away cast shadow planet apart idea like far future according best simulation next five one percent chance leave orbit either crash sun fact nonzero chance three point three six billion year gravitational force orbit turn impact mar within slam earth know enjoy eclipse math behind solar eclipse sort diagram calculation sand thing possibly fit video go ogle five millennium canon solar eclipse ill put link based fantastic work thread ax genius want see video talking math lot shorter theres much mathematically certain click move thats yeah
