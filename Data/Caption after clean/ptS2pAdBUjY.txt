hi coming another math video help boost score math class improve understanding hopefully make math less stressful lesson going talk binomial probability binomial probability work well binomial probability theres two thing happen like either win like know make shot miss shot like success failure like one option know head tail kind thing take look formula weve got n choose k p k times minus p n minus k well n represent trial number times flip coin know basket shot take whatever working p p represent probability success decimal chance success minus p probability failure theres success rate mean theres percent failure rate add right percent k represent know success es wondering probability know make know basket basket thats number minus k would number failure well look example ill show mean let take look first one make basketball shot take probability make exactly shot let look one basically taking ten thats going want make right choose know probability making basket want make nine probability missing making shot thats point three zero one simplify choose factorial factorial factorial first simplify divided factorial going simplify thats going give let look another example probability coin times get head exactly seeing saying know exactly idea going going say times thats see n want get head exactly seven times sok know flip coin theres two know either going land head thats going want get head times course getting head would also getting tail would simplify quantity get probability decimal convert want talk percent chance factorial factorial factorial simplify rest work binomial probability remember two option success failure use formula hope enjoying video learning something getting something go ahead subscribe channel take look past video got coming stay talk next video
