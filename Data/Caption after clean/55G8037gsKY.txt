video going several example really special form really bit warm next video going doon square let show talking let say plus squared equal based everything weve done far might multiply subtract constant get try factor going x minus something times x minus something else equal going say oh one must equal x could going time might see something interesting solve without factor ing well happen add sides equation left hand side equation becomes plus cancel right hand becomes positive sides equation kind straight kind fancy take square root sides equation could take square root plus taking square root sides take square root sides course want take positive negative square root plus could positive square root could negative square root plus equal positive negative square root let write times know thats obviously square root plus squared plus get plus equal factor square root equal plus minus times times square root right square root times square root thing root times square root plus minus square root right might look like really equation plus minus times square really actually two actually simultaneously two could write plus equal positive root plus equal negative times square root one statement equivalent right plus minus statement let solve simultaneously subtract sides equation left hand side left right hand side cant really mathematically mean could calculator ill leave negative plus minus square root times square root equal two separate equation idea subtract sides equation get equal negative plus times square root equation subtract equal negative minus times square root statement right completely equivalent two statement snow last step divide sides divide sides get x equal negative plus minus times square root statement completely equivalent dividing get x equal negative plus times square root one solution solution x equal negative root statement two statement equivalent want encourage let substitute one back feel confident something one expression solution nice vanilla looking equation like let substitute back times x times negative plus root squared minus equal cancel left negative root plus squared equal negative positive cancel left root squared equal going square get times minus equal minus equal try one going get exact another one like remember special form binomial expression going see entire quadratic formula actually derived notion like actually turn turn quadratic equation perfect square equalling something else well see two video let get little warmed seeing type thing let say x squared minus plus equal temptation temptation would subtract sides get right hand side inspect really fast say hey maybe perfect square binomial see well two multiply get positive add get negative hopefully negative jump expression right x minus times x minus left hand side written x minus right hand side still want really emphasize dont want ruin training youve factor ing far perfect square got like x minus times x plus would equal would dead end wouldnt able really anything constructive perfect square say x squared equal take square root sides could say x minus equal plus minus sides equation get x equal plus minus x equal whats plus x could x could equal minus x equal could done equation quadratic equation traditional way way happen subtract sides get x squared minus whats minus minus would equal would traditional factor ing problem type weve seen last two take product get positive sum get negative maybe negative negative get x minus times x minus equal x could equal x could equal fun thing algebra thing two completely different ways long ways going get different answer sand level recognize easier didnt little game head term oh two multiply get add get negative said k x minus oh guess say oh times negative negative plus negative take back still little game head let another one really get nice warmed let say x squared plus plus equal two ways could subtract sides could recognize x plus times x plus right times plus write equation x plus equal square root sides get x plus equal plus minus square root x equal subtract sides negative minus mean x could equal negative plus negative x could equal negative minus negative could done traditional way could sides would gotten x squared plus plus equal youd say hey gee times plus get x plus times x plus equal youd get x could equal negative x could equal negative good warm think ready tackle square
