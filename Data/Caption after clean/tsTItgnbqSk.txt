logic behind construction angle kept compass point b set convenient width made arc width unchanged kept compass point make knock previous arc length kept compass point make knock intersect ing previous arc get angle measure degree let make segment e e e five length equal drawn compass width quadrilateral four equal sides yes rhombus know rhombus bisect right call diagonal intersection point p look triangle b p half length id equal b p half b converse say right triangle site half hypotenuse side opposite degree get angle measure
