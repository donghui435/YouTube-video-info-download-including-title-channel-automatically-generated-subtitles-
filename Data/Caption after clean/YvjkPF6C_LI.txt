right video going example finding inverse matrix one exist going cofactor first one going find inverse matrix negative first thing going find determinant theres different notation determinant either absolute look like absolute value always saw written de determinant get determinant going expand along first row look like well get times negative minus multiply determinant look like well add times well determinant negative well first one going look like times let see well get minus times negative plus like well get times determinant thats one thing thats going use little bit next thing going go going basically use way basically look well first know cover first first column going negative thats whats going calculate determinant going fill second ill get moment next cover first row second column look like going cover first row last column well left negative cover second row first column well left cover row second column well look like see look cover second row third column like well lastly cover third row first column look like well left negative cover third row second column well left cover third row third column left negative k still sign well positive negative positive negative positive negative positive negative positive alright next thing going actually calculate value let see would get negative look like would get negative minus would negative would get minus would use minus sign front well get negative well get minus negative plus times minus well get negative determinant multiply negative well get positive times minus get negative like well times excuse minus times minus negative give us positive times minus well get negative determinant extra negative switch back positive times negative times time weve got well doesnt really matter weve got positive getting anyway k next thing going little reflection reflect thing diagonal going diagonal going stay right theyre going move see going leave negative negative reflect diagonal negative going going get negative positive let see positive switch place going get bottom left top right likewise going switch place going go going go last thing determinant well determinant found going multiply every entry going inverse matrix multiply everything like get negative well get negative negative get times well get found inverse matrix
