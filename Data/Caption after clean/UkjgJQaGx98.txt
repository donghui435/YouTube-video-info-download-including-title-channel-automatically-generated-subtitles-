right video want problem basic graph basically able look graph limit think something lot calculus think lot think graph kind fundamental idea nothing hopefully heavy stuff know certainly first time second time third time see basic idea look atour graph know equal f x notice theres little break x theres little hole theres point discontinuity thats fine nothing nothing going know one little observation pick point particular notice take x closer say two x equal three take x value get closer three whether kind come left side three smaller value obviously right side three well value three think corresponding graph getting closer four well look like closer closer closer three value graph simply getting closer closer two big deal went ahead wrote basically say closer three f x equivalently value get closer number two notice even undefined open circle still know closer get closer write following say limit x approach es function f x equal see notation say say youve got graph equal f x stuff close say hey value get close write equal sign think thats little misleading never get close want thats idea couple problem graph well try answer k notice little graph got break negative got vertical asymptote theres another little break x equal first question say f well mean right plugging x equal whats corresponding value well case f would equal value hopefully see likewise limit question say whats limit x approach es f x say x get closer value get closer x equal zero find corresponding graph x get closer closer zero graph value getting closer closer number two matter side come case well say limit zero f x also two something thats see another part problem unique number simply say limit doesnt exist ask whats f negative simply say plug negative function get whats corresponding simply say plug negative n since dot say plug negative n well get however look limit x approach es negative simply mean close negative close negative corresponding closer closer case look like x get closer closer negative value sare getting closer closer case would say limit negative important doesnt actually matter happen negative thing thats important happen get close negative get close negative value get close let see couple limit x function f x well case x approach es graph well get bigger bigger bigger bigger doesnt matter whether come left right sometimes go infinity people say exist case would actually write would say well limit goes positive infinity mean say graph spiking k let see f say value get outwell plug look getting value couple question suppose ask ourself whats limit x approach es four left one well notice case kind depend take know x close four smaller four well value get closer one right x value left four mean going tobe graph little bit left value get closer well know little bit bigger upper portion graph say closer closer dont know well pretend lining positive cant say two cant say like know case arent opposite sides better way saying simply say limit exist case basically say theres break jump graph limit doesnt exist however talk left right last well well write limit x approach es weve got little positive sign mean right right number mean well case take x bigger getting closer corresponding value son graph well value getting closer closer would say limit right limit x approach es left k take little bit smaller well graph getting closer number positive would say limit x approach es left f x positive lot lot stuff kind video first time seeing limit sand graph think theyre definitely know little definitely idea youve master really think know thing dont go away dont get handle get know everything stays probably think best way think lot times visualize really understand graphically right hope video make sense help
