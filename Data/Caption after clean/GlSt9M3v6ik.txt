hey everybody welcome another one math video video teach solve absolute value absolute value first type absolute value something less number used represent number thats absolute value less number solution going look like x negative value number positive value number second type absolute value inequality absolute value something greater certain number absolute value something greater certain number solution going look like x less negative value number x greater positive value number let get star ted right away absolute value minus less equal positive theres equal sign underneath underneath less symbol still absolute value less example absolute value something less certain answer going look like going negative value positive value inside absolute value minus going middle minus going tobe greater equal negative value number negative value negative going less equal positive need solve compound inequality want want get x middle order get x going get rid negative going add sides inequality side negative plus negative sign stays less equal middle negative positive thing left right hand side sign stays less equal positive positive give us positive want get x since get rid going divide left hand side negative divided negative divided positive number divided positive sign stay sign stays less equal middle two cancel thing left x sign stays another less equal solve absolute value inequality x greater equal negative less equal let move second example absolute value negative plus greater remember absolute value something greater certain number solution going look like x less negative value number x greater positive value since absolute value negative plus greater inside absolute value negative plus going less negative value number negative value negative negative plus going greater positive value number need solve ill one left first negative less negative seven want get x going subtract two sides left hand side two cancel thing left sign stays less negative seven negative two give us negative nine want get rid negative three get x since negative x going divide sides negative three left hand side negative thing left x since divided negative number divided negative sign flip switch aside instead less becomes greater negative negative positive solve quality right negative plus greater want get x going subtract sides left thing left negative sign stays greater positive negative give us positive want get x x negative get rid negative going divide sides negative left hand side negative cancel thing left x since divided negative number divided negative sign flip sides instead greater becomes less right hand side negative cannot simplified write exactly answer x greater x less negative hope understand absolute little bit better need extra help homework solution please web site mack meeting thats math meeting would love help also like way teach want see subscribe tube channel follow twitter liking way see soon load thank much watching take care
