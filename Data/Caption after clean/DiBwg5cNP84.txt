hello professor v welcome u lecture decimal number system example positional notation positional notation column multiplier digit since decimal system column multiplier differ factor ten adjacent multiplier rightmost digit one left ten one hundred value decimal number sum times example value decimal number one thousand times eight times seven times ten plus nine times decimal notation represent integer decimal notation also capable represent ing fractional decimal point immediately right one digit add many like right decimal point column multiplier one tenth size column pattern first digit right decimal point next digit one hundredth integer value decimal number sum times example number one eight seven nine point two one thousand plus eight seven nine two five number line see digit add different size division number example decimal number three point four two three four tenth unit plus two hundredth unit plus five thousandth unit fraction converted decimal number simply dividing numerator denominator long division calculator result division decimal number equivalent fraction decimal number either repeat terminate decimal number finite number decimal point decimal number sequence decimal point decimal written three dot cal led ellipsis indicate pattern forever bar repeat instance indicate three p lacing bar three likewise bar sequence sequence forever unit fraction written decimal form finite number cannot instance fraction one half one fourth one fifth one eighth written finite number digit son hand decimal equivalent decimal point infinite number decimal point one infinite number decimal point infinitely sequence one four two eight five seven one ninth decimal point infinite number may wondering fraction finite number cannot see let look fraction one half number exactly five one half equivalent decimal number zero point five hand fraction one third three smaller four subdivide division see one third fall somewhere thirty three hundredth sand thirty four subdivide division see one third fall somewhere thousandth sand subdivide division see one third still fall two division sit point three three three three smaller point three three three four repeat process indefinitely matter close zoom fraction one third never fall exactly division keep three decimal point although rational like one half finite number like one third cannot seen dividing numerator denominator fraction converted equivalent decimal number either terminate repeat next lecture see convert decimal number fraction
