hi coming another math video help boost score math class improve understanding hopefully make math fun less stressful video going talk find volume prism prism cylinder well prism basically three dimensional object youve got two bases size shape theyre congruent theyre parallel meaning keep going theyre going cross theyre parallel congruent height thats prism cylinder basically exact thing look sort almost think circular prism top bottom circle height parallel congruent formula really easy area base times height capital b mean area base length base actual two dimensional area times height could think could think triangle triangle one another get object like know note pad stack give third dimension give right find look example find volume triangular prism notice dot mean looking object side kind get sense flat surface let go find volume one area base times height like like write formula might want thing subdivide formula area base thats triangle whats formula area triangle one half base times height times height get confused theres lot bees lot h right capital b mean area base area triangle little length base base triangle either three three could base four could height triangle kind like see three four height overall prison ten thats whats separating parallel congruent bases put value one half three times four overall height ten multiply together get times times times divided going give cube mean filling upwith like little ice know speak like many little would fill inside container k next example going talk volume cylinder want say enjoying video go ahead subscribe channel video like coming take check past video let look last example cylinder k idea going find volume area base times height bases circle whats formula circle pi r squared right times height overall height know know pi radius distance center circle point circle give us thats squared want order parentheses right squared well pi give us exact answer pi cube filling like little ice glass hope enjoying go ahead comment let know maybe could better improve video look forward seeing future future video ill talk soon
