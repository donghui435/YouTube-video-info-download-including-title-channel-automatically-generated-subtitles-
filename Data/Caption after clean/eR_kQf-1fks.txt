let go real quick fourth term tenth term equal want us determine right obviously later trying find term right talking sum therefore know formula going use sub n equal r n minus right want go ladies looking something like remember tal ked geometric sequence said sub times times sub said minus equal minus h right add equal write difference however werent given given sub knew though still find difference two could take difference two kind like divide would still give us difference also knew sub still going minus sub right theyre theyre going give us distant difference theyre still going equal look geometric ratio know geometric ratio erase equal raise equal however know common ratio ratio sub still equal wont r would still ratio would still equal yes ladies gentle men still apply term given able figure thats need figure r let shave rather dont sub right let go take term let sub sub four times r right starting finding ratio two term actually going help us find r kind make sense starting one sub going going sub know sub sub times r sixth power r plugging two value r find exact ratio like given two value dividing going give ratio plug formula find ratio right remember taking fraction divided another number multiply reciprocal multiply one multiply top reciprocal one left equal r power remember like x squared equal took square root sides r power equal take sixth root say sixth root well remember break sixth root root could say sixth root one number six times give one thats obviously one number six times give want first start see easy basic first try say actually try calculate calculator notice times times times equal could guess ill tell guy calculator yeah plug calculator understand six times see r equal yeah six come thats beautiful six beautiful know r want able fourteenth term right ladies gentle men sub n equal sub times r n minus want figure know sub actually need go ahead figure sub going first yes least figured r right thats good sorry k sub n equal sub r n minus right need able figure sub yeso kay sub n equal sub times n minus trying find rule yeah problem work keep issue right going able find rule able solve ace going able solve ace dont even know value edit going work like arithmetic sequence though well listen thing right sure trying like arithmetic go back original point figure cant case right cant figure however could say sub sub right star ted need figure term know term dont know first term know term know r sorry let let know could minus something could plug tell know know know sub know r minus therefore could say sub equal sub said times raised fourth power raised power raised power going equal times times sub equal show dont go back use formula find sub one dont go back find formula go one know value right want find plug need make sure though minus finding sub got minus righto kay use yes little different told guy geometric lot times
