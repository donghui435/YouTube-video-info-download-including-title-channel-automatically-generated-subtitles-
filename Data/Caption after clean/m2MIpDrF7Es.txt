introduce derivative really important one eft want talk derivative function like two x seven x also show e x important get intuition let focus function two x let think input time maybe output population size perhaps particularly fertile band pi creature double every single day actually instead population size grow discrete little jump new baby pi creature maybe let think total mass population think better reflect continuity function dont example time total mass equal mass one creature day population grown creature masse sat day squared general keep doubling every day derivative want rate population mass growing thought tiny change mass divided tiny change time let start thinking rate change full day day case grow thats new creature course one day notice rate growth equal population size start day day day grow thats rate new creature per day equal population size start day general rate growth full population size start might tempting say derivative equal rate change function given time equal well value function definitely right direction quite correct making comparison full day considering difference plus derivative need ask happen smaller smaller growth course tenth day hundredth day one one billionth day us think function represent ing population mass since make sense ask tiny change mass tiny fraction day doesnt make much sense ask tiny change discrete population size per second abstractly tiny change time want understand difference plus tall divided ta change function per unit time looking narrowly around given point time rather course full day thing would love clear geometric picture made everything thats follow pop diagram could point one value say see part derivative know one please let know goal rest series maintain playful spirit type play follow finding numerical visual start taking close look plus ta core property exponential break times really important property add two value exponent break output product kind let relate additive like tiny step time multiplicative thing like ratio si mean look happen hereafter move factor term minus divided remember derivative whatever whole expression approach es approach es first glance might seem like unimportant manipulation tremendously important fact term right stuff live completely separate term doesnt depend actual time go calculator plug small value example maybe divided find smaller smaller choice value approach es specific number around worry number seem mysterious central point kind constant unlike derivative stuff depend separate value derivative kind make sense ear lier felt like derivative least looking course full day evidently rate change function much smaller time quite equal proportional peculiar proportionality constant theres much special number instead dealt function exponential property would also led us conclusion derivative proportional time would proportionality constant bases exponent fun trying see various proportionality constant may ing seeing find pattern example plug power tiny number minus divide tiny number youd find relevant proportionality constant around maybe maybe would notice number exactly three times constant associated base certainly arent random kind pattern number number second question ultimately going explain mystery constant sis whether theres base proportionality constant one derivative power proportional actually equal special constant fact number e happen show sense define number e ask e property little like pi happen ratio circumference circle diameter heart define value exponential function proportional derivative e along special number proportionality constant one meaning e actually equal derivative one way think look graph e tit peculiar property slope tangent line point height point horizontal axis existence function like answer question mystery constant sand give different way think proportional derivative key use chain rule example derivative e take derivative outermost function due special nature e derivative inner function constant rather apply ing rule blindly could take moment practice intuition chain rule tal ked last video thinking slight nudge value intermediate change nudge final value e way point e power constant times equal constant times question mystery constant really comes certain algebraic manipulation number also written e natural log nothing fancy definition natural ask question e equal function function e power natural log times saw combining fact e derivative chain rule derivative function proportional proportionality constant equal natural log indeed go plug natural log two find mystery constant ran goes bases mystery proportionality constant pop taking derivative sis natural log base answer question e equal base fact throughout application calculus rarely see exponential written base power almost always write exponential e power constant times equivalent mean function like tor also written e constant time tat risk stay ing symbol want emphasize many many ways write particular exponential function see something written e constant time thats choice make write way number e fundamental function special writing exponential term e like give constant exponent nice readable meaning let show mean sort natural phenomena involve rate change thats proportional thing thats example rate growth population actually tend size population assuming limited resource slow ing thing put cup hot water cool rate water cool proportional difference temperature room water said little differently rate difference proportional invest money rate grow sis proportional amount money case variable rate change proportional function de scribing variable time going look like kind exponential even though lots ways write exponential function natural choose express e power constant times since constant natural meaning proportionality constant size variable rate change always want thank made series possible
