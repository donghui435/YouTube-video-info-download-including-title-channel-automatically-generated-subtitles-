assume standing point friend tell treasure pot kilometer away home long take find direction go could maybe hard know exactly provided distance one dimensional information one dimensional information like cal led scalar quantity question would direction home told kilometer northeast direction precise information location becomes two dimensional information distance direction treasure pot two dimensional information like cal led vector quantity scalar one vector two dimensional speed good example call physics scalar magnitude specify ing direction thats scalar magnitude direction case velocity however direction thats refer red vector quantity vector quantity involve magnitude also direction add directional information speed vector quantity cal led velocity additional information make specific temperature change example one dimensional quantity specify rising falling temperature two someone say temperature change two wont really know increase look various scalar vector next tutorial long study physics speed velocity distance displacement mass weight force acceleration look clearer concept become
