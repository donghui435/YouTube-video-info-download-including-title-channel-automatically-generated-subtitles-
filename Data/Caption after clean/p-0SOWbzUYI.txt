welcome another video squared plus b squared equal c squared forget formula company theorem every conceivable way least book k finally video theorem theorem main mission today chase time proof time ill introduce truly gorgeous crazy divine fact beaten track finish video ill tell little bit new book thats get star ted math let little theorem misnomer basic fact right angled discovered actually known ancient least thousand born also although often first produced rigorous proof theorem actually seem exist evidence support claim plenty math historian doubt leader influential mathematical cult habit result likely practice name came attached theorem anyway late gone ill also call theorem theorem simply let get star ted looking couple gorgeous proof theorem take beautiful popular let make four aright angled triangle short sides b hypotenuse c arrange four triangle square time smaller inside small square get partially cover big blue square triangle small square length well length length hypotenuse triangle c area small square equal c shift one triangle large blue area well triangle cover much blue new blue area large c shifting large new blue area well obviously still c squared right comes punch line shift obviously blue area still c squared however also squared plus b squared squared plus b squared equal c squared super neat convincing definitely important stress argument count bulletproof proof wed check example diagram need check two square looking really square matter right triangle start hard step afford skip look deceiving thats true math life give idea proof look like let show proof theorem famous math textbook ever written year old element ancient mathematician translation whoa loo ked neat didnt really actually also pretty hard understand based diagram text hand also capture gist classic proof year still going strong pretty animation animation lost mine prove showing two orange figure shave area two blue figure weve got orange plus blue top squared plus b squared equal orange plus blue bottom c squared take argument little orange square get cover orange region white copy right angled triangle shifting triangle change area right done blue square orange parallelogram orange figure hereafter covered little red triangle shifting triangle arrow stays unchanged blue parallelogram pretty much diagram done theres c squared also clear orange blue square equal size orange blue rectangle millennia hundred different proof theorem theres even book list thats definitely people know thats book got really really least let show another triangle let scale factor c new triangle sides c b c c c scale another copy original triangle b let right one copy triangle scale one go let close look see two sides two mean three triangle fit together rectangle like squared plus b squared equal c squared absolutely gorgeous lots lots proof beautiful shown example check proof discovered da one discovered president gar field keen find theres need dig book ear lier instead look nicely illustrate list proof absolutely amazing web site scroll ing really quick oh case current president trump ever tweet proof please someone let know immediately alright shown far great none know sound strange proof proof general super theorem theorem one infinitely many special case saying proving general theorem comprise infinitely many special case easier proving theorem one special case super weird well well see whats super theorem well say attach three suitably scaled asquare way sides right angled triangle two together equal square turns thats super theorem true replace square shape example little semicircle add exactly area large one little pentagon add exactly two area large one thats super theorem true actually follow theorem see let focus semicircle square clear every one semicircle fraction corresponding square fact quick pi calculation thats exercise every one semicircle percent area corresponding square since two smaller square add times smaller square add times square like thats saying two smaller semicircle add large semicircle square exactly argument also follow square fact even strong er exactly argument shape make sure theres misunderstanding mean let rephrase said prove scratch true special shape proof immediately true shape show amazing insight prompt natural question one best super terrific perfect shape easiest see true turns look wait done thats easiest proof case gone crazy note actually looking three triangle two two smaller obviously add one three triangle similar angle attach la original red triangle like really done proof imaginable shape right angled triangle pretty bloody amazing say definitely something real savor get super fact little puzzle go pizza shop usual small medium large pizza turns one small plus one medium together cost exactly one large pizza pizza knife decide better deal smaller plus medium comb large pizza leave answer comment also let know proof like best great works right angled triangle triangle well theres also really nice hidden school mathematics triangle another look proof turns equality colour diagram triangle like diagram two rectangle colour equal little trigonometry proof quite simple let show see two green rectangle really area label sides b c angle opposite c gamma read straight diagram two green rectangle area times b times cos gamma yet another exercise busy today green rectangle equal area insight get sum top two square squared plus b squared minus two green minus two times b cos gamma equal c squared course name cosine rule case angle cos zero cosine rule turns standard comes cosine rule next best triangle angle beside degree degree cos example degree cosine rule take particularly nice form degree get plus sign almost pretty degree know maybe world giant hexagon degree angle dominate another little puzzle one remarkable thing existence triple triple positive integer sa b c squared plus b squared equal c squared like example plus squared equal squared find non trivial positive integer triple satisfy two equation people always think around thousand year know everything worth knowing theres nothing new discovered wrong new proof fascinating fact still discovered theres much beautiful stuff hardly anybody hear example recently discovered proof theorem seem really yeah actually new actually look site list theres proof us look yeah actually amount new proof anyway anyway finish little gallery really flavored theorem culminate time respect de theorem squared plus b squared equal c squared height squared plus b squared equal squared hand knew hand well really easy prove give try theorem one works arbitrary triangle drawing x z x squared plus squared plus z squared equal squared plus b squared plus c squared times every single one new green triangle area red one star ted easy prove feel free give try anyway theorem suppose right angled triangle throw square sides green triangle like yellow square equal c squared times yellow square equal sum pretty amazing anything nice keep going sum two small pink square equal large pink square unexpected pretty seem many discovered keep extending way k really finish let tell higher dimensional counterpart first counterpart many familiar begin term rectangle rectangle sides b diagonal c well squared plus b c squared version one straightforward counterpart replace rectangle rectangular box like sides b c diagonal squared plus b squared plus c squared equal squared works dimension fora box sides b c diagonal e weve got squared plus b squared plus c squared plus squared equal e squared would know know second totally different totally crazy way generalize higher dimension cal led de theorem version discovered century de de motivate interpret right angle triangle get cut corner rectangle like cutting corner box get thats triangular pyramid red cut forming base pyramid weve also got three face triangle b c longer distance right angled triangle area red base de theorem say squared plus b squared plus c squared equal squared absolutely love one find surprising work squared instead squared distance also higher dimension whats squared volume hypervolume often assign easy proof fact assignment maybe youd like try hand one said lots lots lots homework today example stunning fact video make sure also check links description particular list proof also contain smarty new proof thats today except also wan ted tell new book mathematical society wrote weekly math column one big book collection article theme book come really really nice full color look great like video opportunity bridge time video find prehistory general look thats web site especially mathematical movie data base mathematical movie clip collection book article thats really finally today
