welcome video throughout textbook see set normally distributed mean set balanced theyre heavily skewed left theyre heavily skewed right set normally distributed important describe set normally could use normal curve bell shaped curve describe data time normally distributed curve powerful tool allow us predictive chance something happening also better idea data like powerful term tool going use throughout course let get star ted right away example make lot sense problem say test score class normally distributed needs given us need tell normally distributed need make safe assumption data fact normally distributed know normally distributed normal curve also say sin problem average test score class going write letter nu average equal also standard deviation equal standard deviation population written sigma standard deviation equal problem us draw data normal curve first thing going going draw going put directly middle curve going go middle curve going put average directly middle distance one line another line equal one standard deviation go right average one standard deviation need standard deviation need add standard deviation plus equal value line equal concept go one line also distance one standard deviation need another plus equal concept go left average instead one standard deviation subtract going left average one standard deviation need subtract ten instead ten minus ten equal go another standard deviation need subtract another minus equal let take look area underneath curve area underneath curve actually give us information area curve tell us probability test score notice half area greater average mean half equal mean theres chance student score greater also notice half area curve less average mean chance half theres chance score normal curve powerful tool probability score um let talk empirical rule empirical us area one standard deviation two three exactly empirical rule empirical rule data fall within one standard deviation know empirical rule within one standard deviation average one standard deviation average since since curve perfectly symmetrical know area exactly half area left take half know area right average one standard deviation know area left average one standard deviation also percent plus give sixty eight percent also know empirical rule data fall within two know area underneath first standard deviation second standard deviation must equal percent add percent add together give us know empirical rule data two standard area curve two standard weve already describe curve theres left two space curve like said curve perfectly divide five percent half get percent know one side percent side also two half percent us remain ing five percent curve entire curve want show use curve show powerful predict ing probability student use curve predict score student order need find area coloring right let add together probability student scoring equal curve percent percent another percent ill continue also percent also two percent add together get probability student scoring ninety five equal ninety seven point five hope getting good idea powerful curve really really predict test score let one time let find probability student test score thing need find probability find area area percent total area curve know probability student scoring also going percent hope gave better idea normal distribution normal curve empirical rule next video going similar one instead standard deviation going touse almost two standard deviation shouldnt trouble next video really hope enjoying theyre easy follow see next one
