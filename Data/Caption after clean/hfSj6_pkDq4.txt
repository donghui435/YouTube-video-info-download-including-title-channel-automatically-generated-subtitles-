today want take little time discuss right familiar topic right probably need watch one made another video talk different type locate graph whether look like thing really need background information watch video ill go ahead put video description know preface knowledge ought able address question like right let suppose tell find x value continuous alright follow x value removable non removable continuity exist alright going run example would go question alright first example right f x equal x squared plus hopefully recognize right bat thats polynomial curve right x squared going parabola alright hopefully somewhere along line youve told polynomial curve degree higher smooth continuous alright going continuous everywhere alright dont answer might want write f x continuous dont dont worry f x continuous right taking look example f x equal x squared plus right student memorize several shift look like one really memorize right relatively simple one theres variety ways approach right could take look rational function right thing worry know domain number would plug x would make end dividing zero bad thing thats going create problem right start around plug negative right negative anything negative negative going plus going four going good plug right three denominator plug positive number like say plug plus three still going get real number right really know whatsoever restriction domain anything thats going keep function continuous alright turns continuous function dont really worry right f x continuous werent sure go analysis come conclusion continuous could always use calculator put right example weve got f x equal sine pi x know hopefully recall sine continuous everywhere nice little curvy line curvy graph going left right direction alright little coefficient right going kind play graph know compress expand one way conclude one f x continuous entire domain f x continuous right wan ted throw even though theyre give continuous right dont worry right theres little bit work right let stake look example got f x equal x squared right going real easy going able sketch cant rough sketch really really fat fast anything going want take look whats happening denominator restriction thats going tobe right first thing would probably look see could factor right going see theres thing cross thing um let take right let take denominator go ahead factor factor x going x minus denominator right going let see really easy looking denominator like right got x right zero denominator zero times anything going zero right thats gon na bad right got x equal would causing division zero looking right cannot let x equal x got zero right right yes know seeing restriction denominator function discontinuous let kind write let write discontinuous discontinuous right right restriction denominator right thats one way right depending well remember everything right denominator right thats going vertical asymptote p cal c class would take rational function take denominator set equal zero solve like done right whatever get take plug numerator nonzero number know youve got vertical asymptote going k x well take plug back numerator get dont vertical asymptote right obviously got something else going cant x equal right x know said x cant five right well take five plug back numerator times going give good right depending much remember right clearly tell youve got asymptote five thing could going right let x equal right going domain function thats going hole know vertical asymptote gon na hole right hole right let stake expression x x minus x take expression simplify right got ta get x top got next bottom right cross right rational expression right word removing x equal right right discontinuity removable discontinuity removed cross right discontinuity hole let kind sum weve right notice discontinuous domain right specifically want know x value removable non removable discontinuity exist would probably answer let say discontinuous spell discontinuous x equal conclude include crossing removable discontinuity right one x equal right conclude vertical asymptote going got type infinite discontinuity going make non answer ing question right right clearly way work problem run discontinuity occur ring k couple example youve got little bit work showing k right f x equal x plus x squared minus k going know right top head dont right going start start factor ing see cross anything going look denominator see theres type restriction thats going right going plus numerator factor denominator thats difference two square x x minus k right away right cant take denominator set everything equal going find denominator right setting equal right x cannot equal negative would make make denominator cant divide right x equal right x becomes got denominator going good right alright right bat right know discontinuous right discontinuous right let also qualify denominator let go analyze little bit whats going right could vertical asymptote right let stake right right two plug back get two plus two right right tell x x equal got vertical asymptote going right thats going whats causing discontinuity right let take look negative plug negative right negative give zero right qualify vertical asymptote right know cantlet x equal negative asymptote something going right right going end hole right want prove going hole algebraically show going hole let take expression right factor let factor outcross see weve got done factory rather right crash yes cross yes got binomial x plus two binomial x plus right cross right soon cross removing x equal making removable discontinuity right sum answer would would discontinuous spell right time go discontinuous right couple different place x equal negative right said crossed removable specifically know thats going hole also one vertical asymptote x equal right vertical asymptote vertical asymptote going right know going non removable discontinuity larrigan good job spelling tonight get idea non removable good right let one close right let stake look piecewise function right lot times going automatically sketch suppose theres nothing wrong right however honestly think whats going piecewise function right going better probably going quick er draw sketch two piece one made straight going pretty simple right main focus one heck going one right well plug one right right going times going give answer one would closed dot right would closed dot right portion graph x less would take one plug one plus two three right different spot would open dot would open dot one say right would closed dot right happening right youve jump graph kind really rough sketch right x greater equal plugged one two minus one one right add know closed right right one right one right let guess rough slope dont know maybe something like right let second x less one k plug one plus going give three got open dot thats less alright want everything less straight line let really really rough sketch let say know going go two kind something along see long took sketch even though really really rough sketch right lot easier right plug get one plug get know got jump going well got jump obviously discontinuity right could conclude discontinuous know right one right clearly shown jump right non removable much better job spelling right example know apply ing concept discontinuity identify ing looking function especially dont graph ing calculator going going going approach video go ahead get like want help math go ahead subscribe channel thanks
