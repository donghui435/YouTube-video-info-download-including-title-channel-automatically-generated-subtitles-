scatter plot try understand know exactly correlation refer know find exactly first terminology correlation could positive correlation negative correlation could correlation basically plotting point scatter trying figure trying draw best fit know would line positive slope meaning going right would negative slope meaning going right would relatively correlation want refine could say well thats strong positive correlation mean strong positive point know well like straight line draw line best fit would come close hit ting strong positive know point almost straight line trend ing downwith negative slope would strong negative course positive mean yeah generally going know really point arent really close perfectly straight line thing weak negative end video also going show calculator actually find value use r represent correlation coefficient ill show works well thing want mention talk value spectrum negative one one negative one negative correlation going right point perfectly straight line thing positive theyre perfectly straight line closer middle zero whether negative point one positive point one closer get zero mean like theres relatively correlation theres pattern really going right really going right basically get spectrum towards negative positive better point straight line let look first one would say positive negative would say strong pause strong negative weak positive weak negative well draw line best fit look like know right maybe kind like know would say probably weak negative one weak negative correlation gon na negative value might somewhere around know negative negative one definitely see trend ing right thats going positive correlation coefficient value know positive going like maybe know positive maybe positive one see point perfectly straight right positive slope definitely gon na strong positive correlation r value close one exactly positive one right one see hard really tell trying let draw line best fit draw going right go drawing going right theres really relatively correlation would correlation would close zero zero thats overview correlation coefficient go ahead take look calculator going exactly calculate value know drawing line best fi tokay calculator let show works going try find correlation coefficient first thing want go statistics right want edit enter going arrow top going hit clear button arrow going clear list thing list one go top hit clear arrow going x list one list two point us let go ahead reduce oh negative x negative arrow let see written negative negative one let see negative want go back tost arrow right want want regression number see like linear regression like equal b like slope intercept form line enter see giving us value equation line going equal x plus negative put b equation look value point positive correlation going right pretty close mean know pretty know pretty good going going write equation line equal let see oh thats r value got let see equal point six seven six x plus negative point four seven let goback equal let put equation point four seven six going go back let see going go back second plot see going turn plot oka yon want see going select one let go back graph upper right hand corner see theres theres line best fit see point know theyre little bit distance away know line see definitely trend ing right thats positive value bad definitely definitely definitely positive exactly perfectly one straight line know pretty close thats doit one last thing want mention sometimes working correlation coefficient dont automatically give value go c right zero youd want select second want want arrow diagnostics going hit letter find right want arrow diagnostic want turn see say diagnostic diagnostic enter enter go linear regression sure give value otherwise sometimes change first get calculator wont give value thats turn diagnostic subscribe channel check math tutor ing video math tutor ing look forward seeing future video ill talk soon
