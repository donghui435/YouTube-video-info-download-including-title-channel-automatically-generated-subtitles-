got triangle know two angle one claim figure everything else triangle information give two angle side figure two sides going course figure third angle let try figure way going going use something cal led law sine sin future video prove law going show actually apply fairly straightforward idea law tell ratio sine angle side opposite going constant angle triangle example triangle right degree angle degree angle add right let see going minus minus minus going degree angle right apply ing law let label different call side right length let call side right length b law tell ratio sine angle opposite side going constant triangle tell us sine angle sine length side opposite going equal sine length side opposite going equal sine length side opposite sine degree band wan ted figure awe could solve equation right wan ted solve b could set equal right let solve sine degree swell might remember unit even triangle thats dont remember use calculator verify already degree mode going equal two another way thinking thats going equal piece equal equal sine degree write equal sine degree actually could also say since could actually time equal equal sine degree b actually sine degree another one easy jump unit might remember square two write thats square root two two use calculator get decimal value right either case either solve let solve b one thing could could take reciprocal sides equation reciprocal reciprocal right hand side sine degree sand solve could multiply sides times sine get four times sine degree equal get calculator four times sine give us approximately equal round nearest approximately equal look right two made angle appropriately look like figure b could take reciprocal sides get four equal b square root two two could multiply sides times square root two two would get b equal four times square root two two come think b four times sine figure wan ted actual numerical value could write two square root two let actually figure square root two equal b approximately equal clear four divided two square root two approximately equal round nearest also seem pretty reasonable key law cosine two angle able figure everything else actually two sides angle also would able figure everything else triangle
