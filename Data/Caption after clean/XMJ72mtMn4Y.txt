line goes point equation linelet try visualize x axis dont draw problem always help visualize axis first point negative coma point rig th point go right line connect look something like line draw rough approximation draw straight er draw dotted line maybe easier dotted line line look something like let find equation good place start find slope remember want find equation equal x plus b slope intercept form slope b first try solve find slope line slope change change x view value end point minus value starting point x value end point minus x value starting pointlet make clear equal change change x w ich thing rise run w ich thing value ending point minus value starting point exact thing change x value ending point minus x value starting point exact thing change x pick one starting point one ending point let make starting point make ending point change change go star ted yis equal six star ted equal go way equal negative rig th change look graph say oh start go negative went want use formula give thing finished negative finished negative want subtract want subtract right ending beginning negative minus negative minus equal negative tell us change go point point go rise negative go thats negative comes find change x look graph star ted x equal negative go way x equal star ted x equal negative go way x equal take us one go zero five change x look visually use formula exact idea ending x value ending x value starting x value negative minus negative minus negative thing plus slope negative exact thing negative negative divided numerator denominator know equation bey equal negative third thats plus b still need solve intercept get equation use information know fact several point information use fact line goes point could use point well know equal negative equal six x equal negative negative third times x x equal negative equal literally substitute x value back know solve b let see negative times negative equal positive five third plus band subtract third sides equation left hand side left hand side rig th get whats minus thats going let take common denominator thing minus thing thing minus course cancel get b equal third done know know slope know equation line equal negative third x plus intercept write mixed easier visualize four intercept right intercept right thats coma coma third even roughly drawn diagram look like slope negative thing negative see slope downward slope negative little bit steeper slope quite negative negative write negative mixed number hopefully found entertaining
