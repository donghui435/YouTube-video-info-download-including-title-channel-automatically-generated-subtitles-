let go ahead see graph three cotangent pi x divided two right guy loo ked paragraph hopefully youve already done already written notice cotangent engine amplitude right theres restriction high go go infinitely infinitely need dont need worry finding today mark three still gon na graph ill show impact next thing need understand period gon na understand period unlike sonic coattail sine cosine period going pi b remember period distance going take graph complete one function b case going pi two take pi pi reciprocal right whats gon na cancel oh never left therefore distance thats gon na take us complete one cycle cotangent going one thing guy remember talking translation horizontal translation regular graph sine cosine period end point rip like maybe man take example guy loo ked cal led paragraph one period paragraph one period paragraph alright notice kind asymptote zero pot alright want see equal cotangent x right obviously weve made right theres obviously going difference pi x divided two graph going look going look different want want find new period two want find going right currently asymptote f pop originally value x asymptote x know zero x value pi x value well x value change theyre pi divided two want whatever take whatever inside function put equal two asymptote always take whatever function set equal two original asymptote cotangent asymptote zero pi solve x sides zero equal pi x pi zero yes one multiply divide five two pi x divided five listen people thats dont asset pet pie asymptote bad well might say well relate remember hi guy number pi right going like little bit short draw leave paragraph going draw graph redwood said asymptote make nice little dotted line represent told also going one thing need understand intercept normal graph paragraph pi halfway two intercept split set new intercept going tobe next thing start graph ing next thing need determine well dont need another next intercept going go well ladies long period parent long next asymptote going another moreover give us say next period theres one right going add another period going descriptive please put away look make sense k see graph gon na look like ladies gentle men best way really find find point plug know know tan god could maybe plug pi maybe plug like tan pi right maybe plug tan pi calculator could figure guy plug coupler see x value tell exactly point help get exact curve want right want work really concerned guy getting exact value graph want make sure guy understand graph gon na look like gon na help guy go back little bit remember x squared parabola correct guy member one third x squared parabola get get already right got happen x said x square actually got compressed like right well guess ladies gentle men without plugging point determine going exact rule paragraph look like cocaine mean compress lot shorter curve still going approach maybe say gon na approach men much smaller yes asymptote know equation figured look thats path cotangent crap found knew paragraph told guy didnt make pair cotangent arent pi paragraph find new asymptote set equal whatever function thats yes use going tell yeah mean depend want house pi algebraically probably easiest use yeah want graph negative say whats gon na happen graph b negative pi negative pi negative pi yeah still works right guy see graph would look like gon na want verify fact pick tangent new tangent forward know pick canton something see change graph right frank want make sure understand number thats greater front function make graph right sketching less going less something like much kind grab asset open still cross point kind like slow penis reflect gon na different make sense k front change theres empty good going determine kind compress thats right like said guy ill mean time purpose gon na go graph ing different right guy understand thats going consider ground yes sine cosine different sine cosine thats gon na telling amplitude still pressing doesnt different way aint got general question
