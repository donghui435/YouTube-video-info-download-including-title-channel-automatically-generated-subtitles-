consider triangle go area triangle dont height base given length three sides since weve given length sides know use formula use formula need semi perimeter triangle let zoom find perimeter parameter plus plus sum three sides semiperimeter parameter divided sum equal semiperimeter equal found semiperimeter use formula find area triangle area triangle equal square root minus minus b minus c b c three sides triangle case b c need little careful get really big area would equal square root minus thirty nine x minus equal square root x minus x think product massive worst thing could multiply find product video square root seen big use prime factorization method find square root use prime factorization method reduce prime factor let look start written times times times written x written written times next step prime factorization method start making group two four two written x x x apart two three write times fives written times two seven times seven get square root pick one number pair multiply remove square root sign equal x x x give us square formula pretty simple calculation need careful another important thing need remember answer area always squared formula area triangle base x height formula easy understand base height get get squared look formula carefully square root raised give us unit swell squared
