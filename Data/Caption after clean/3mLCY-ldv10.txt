well welcome video concluding unit dealing probability know bummer know good thing must come end point maybe side maybe youve unit probability know first time kind challenge theres lot keep track well regardless video gon na looking gon na looking two different law one going valid law well talk though going looking definition count basically saying outcome experiment probability p whatever might n trial particular experiment count times wed expect particular l come would n times p example four one two chance getting boy girl boy example would times would youd expect count girl rather either one youd expect two boy two girl swell end four girl illustrate fact count always tell happen give expectation look look another count adult population unemployment rate particular town percent gon na sample adult town look see many actually unemployed figure count unemployment would taking five percent unemployment times get expectation thats count affect answer thats extraneous information going information effect outcome looking sample adult thats would find let read next paragraph learn say event count event sum make let look wet season region days long probability rain days dry season days theres chance rain days number days rain year accepted number days would rain way figure would take days would expect rain would expect day days would give point two five say actually one particular year region well difference two would well take away happen one thirty point two five give us thirteen point seven five percent difference would take thirteen point seven five total give us three point eight percent tell us happen particular case tell us well expect happen long run important interesting piece history world war carrick south capture german army den mark intern camp pass time experiment chance process es one experiment coin ten thousand times suppose time observe five thousand sixty seven head well gon na figure whats number head situation well happen half time half five thousand would expect get five thousand head flip coin ten thousand actually five thousand sixty seven times difference would sixty seven figure relative frequency head would take actually five thousand sixty seven divide number trial ten thousand get whoops zero six seven fifty point six seven percent difference relative frequency probability head swell take six seven subtract get difference could even say would way could look notice notice difference five thousand five seem like lot however relative frequency probability point zero zero six seven whats going relative frequency get closer closer number thats call law large nothing experiment closer going get actual probability probability might average someone string bad luck say know well lot average shouldnt know next time game win string bad luck bound win sometime well law average really inaccurate probability every time something probability always gon na string bad luck probability still going string every single time probability really thing law average law inaccurate ked law average sit true really law true probability closer would get closer outcome mean next turn chance previous turn pretty much summarize lesson pretty simple theyre looking two different hopefully understand difference activity p function statistics trigonometry book activity could want look book point law versus law large sake time fact gon na different simulation would going take time video going end video good luck work assignment
