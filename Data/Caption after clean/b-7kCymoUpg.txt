previous video derived formula sum finite geometric series first term r common ratio want video think sum infinite geometric series always found mildly mind blowing actually mildly mind blowing sum infinite thing see actually get finite value depending common ratio theres couple ways think could say sum infinite geometric series limit n approach es infinity could say limit n approach es infinity business sum zero n times r k would thing taking limit n approach es infinity right would thing limit n approach es infinity business let copy paste dont keep switching colors copy paste whats limit n approach es infinity think second encourage pause video ill give one hint think r greater one r equal one actually let make clear let think absolute value r greater one absolute value r equal one absolute value r less one well assuming youve given go absolute value r greater one exponent explode approach es infinity number going become massively massively huge whole thing going become least could think absolute value whole thing going become large number r equal one denominator going become zero going dividing denominator formula break formula helpful get actually give sensical result absolute value r zero one weve already tal ked even dealing geometric even talking geometric series r equal zero let think case absolute value r greater zero less one whats going happen case well denominator going make sense right whats going happen well take something absolute valueless one take higher higher every time multiply going get number smaller absolute value term right entire term going go zero n approach es infinity imagine r talking hundredth thousandth power millionth billionth power quickly approach es zero goes zero absolute value r less one could argue would equal one minus r example geometric series infinite geometric simple say first term one successive term going multiply one plus plus squared plus third plus keep going forever telling us sum infinite sum infinite number term pretty fascinating concept come going first term one one minus common ratio common ratio case minus thing one equal could view one mildly amazing thing
