probably used idea measuring angle use everyday language weve done example play list angle like might call angle angle like could call angle wed often use symbol like go degree youd essentially form straight linelet make proper go degree essentially done one full rotation watch figure skating someone rotation theyll say oh especially skate boarding competition sand thing like one thing realize might obvious right get go whole notion system way measure angle sand think well call full rotation degree sand theres possible encourage think degree show culture full rotation well theres couple ancient calendar sand even calendar close ancient calendar based days year ancient astronomer thing move sky per day another theory ancient equilateral triangle lot base number system base system like divide thing probably divide thing circle divided equilateral triangle equilateral triangle divided base number system might end want think video alternate way measuring angle sand alternate way even though might seem intuitive get go much mathematically pure based cultural artifact base astronomical degree alien another planet would use degree especially degree astronomical phenomena might use going define radian theres certain degree purity let cut chase define radian let draw circle best attempt drawing circle let draw center circle let draw radius let say radius might already notice word radius close word radian sand thats coincidence let say circle radius length r let construct angle ill call angle theta let construct angle theta let call angle right theta let say sake argument angle exact right measure look arc subtend angle seem like fancy word let draw angle draw angle look arc subtend angle thats fancy word thats really talking circle intersect two sides arc right subtend angle theta let write arc subtend angle say theta exact right size arc also length radius circle arc also length r given de fining new type angle measurement wan ted call radian close radius many define angle well obvious one kind radian another way guess radii well say look arc one radius dont call right one radian exactly radian defined circle angle one arc subtend exactly one radius long imagine might little bit useful start interpret type give degree really little bit math think circumference think many radius es angle angle radian tell exactly arc length let couple thought experiment given would angle go let draw another circle thats center well start right would happen angle measure radian angle would radian sand could almost think would angle one full revolution would definition would radian swell let think arc subtend angle arc subtend angle entire circumference circle well whats circumference circle term length r radius length r whats circumference circle term r well know thats going pi r going back angle length arc subtend angle many pi pi times r angle right ill call different well let call angle x x case going pi radian sand arc length pi radius one unit would pi times pi given let start think convert radian degree sand vice follow one full revolution pi radian many degree going equal already know full revolution degree degree swell could either write word use little degree notation actually let write word degree sit might make thing little bit clearer kind case snow wan ted simplify little bit could divide sides case left hand side would get pi radian would equal many degree swell would equal degree sand could write way could write way see degree sand also see draw circle around weve gone halfway around circle arc length arc subtend angle half circumference half circumference pi call pi radian degree sand come one radian would many degree swell would divide sides left hand side youd ill write singular radian equal dividing sides let make clear show voodoo dividing sides pi hereon left hand side left right hand side radian equal degree starting make interesting way convert think way degree many radian well let start let thing said pi radian equal want think degree let solve degree divide sides left radian equal degree radian equal degree might seem daunting first time exposed especially exposed everyday life going see next example sis long keep mind whole idea pi radian equal pi radian equal degree keep mind always two might say hey remember convert two thing swell remember hopefully intuitive pi radian equal degree sand well work bunch example next video make sure used converting one way
