cedar ball kind ball put closet chase away insect snow one positive thing say experiment smell nice cant say many oh smell professor yes sniff yeah professor probably polish long time soup bowl mean bor rowed cafeteria put ball let say three swirl see ball circulate direction course say say swirl mean actually rotating whole thing swirl ball circulate direction direction ball circulate direction counterclockwise let increase number ball make crowded swirl ball start wrong direction opposite direction transition one ball circulation direction swirl two three already seen circulate direction four still direction five theres lot seven pretty clear theyre opposite direction eight quite remarkable bit like phase transition like total phase transition gas liquid ball swirl ball independent dont talk one another minding happen whenever wall soup bowl bang one transmit bang linear momentum direction like sent direction thats direction talking one another independent particle sin contrast increase crowdedness whatever linear momentum input scattered among neighboring contact closely touching one another doesnt get wasted rubbing phenomenon imagine ball like wall soup bowl rub get pu shed away also get rotated like rotation transmit ted neighbor close next one next one next one rotation propagate among entire group linear momentum wasted angular momentum tendency keep rotating thats quantity measure much rotation get transition linear momentum dominated regime angular momentum dominated regime happen rub like roll direction opposite start moving globally drifting direction opposite way pushing thats take effect really little bit like facetious fashion like transition gas liquid see gas molecule flying around minding free dont really talk one another bounce wall vessel bounce liquid molecule touching slide interact lot really like transition gas liquid order parameter increasing crowdedness like lowering temperature increasing pressure keep making crowded eventually freeze solid completely see really like phase two perhaps say many weve already seen collectively circulate direction opposite direction true please look individual ball example middle one probably easiest going swirl whole thing counterclockwise like see middle one also spinning going around around counterclockwise fashion individual ball example look one like one drawing trajectory look like still counterclockwise theres global drift goes clockwise quite interesting individually theyre still right thing speak together theres purely collective group behavior emerge exactly wrong thing really whats happening individual particle individual molecule together collective phenomenon way analyze course know rotation three dimensional ball thats complicated two dimension imagine example disc sliding completely slippery surface like ice skating rink coated rubber let say contact one another rub periphery arena get exactly kind phenomenon professor speaking previous video paper clip linked rubber band finish something far linking paper clips together sometimes refer addition
