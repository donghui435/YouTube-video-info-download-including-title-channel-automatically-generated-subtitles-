ice cream actually ice cream top cone one look look something like inverted look like whenever see three dimensional figure ask two figure made defined cone one circular base slant curved surface slant curved surface begin vertex towards base next thing need know cone defined acone defined two parameter first height second radius circular base length height length radius circular base parameter given get unique cone mean say ked draw cone radius circular base draw like well may draw like maybe like radius circular base case define uniquely need height let analyze inverted cone circular base hollow open cone open corn vertically vertex look open bit look guess sector circle curved surface cone uplook like sector circle
