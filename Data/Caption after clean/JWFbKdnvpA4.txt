born tackle wild arithmetic sequence telling welcome back going jump special kind today well real solid review get going want review term want comfortable first one say sequence right ordered blank ordered hopefully fill last blank cal led ordered list basically like saying comma comma comma exedra thats consider tobe list follow pattern hopefully comma sum within sequence cal led hopefully youd spit word series basically delete replace plus sign said plus plus plus plus dot dot term together would cal led series series exist world math series look like people randomly pul led thin air definite pattern concerned within chapter year everything sequence look definite pattern going look within world sequence definite pattern going focus put lot energy two really special kind first arithmetic sequence thats lesson arithmetic first kind second really special kind cal led geometric series going special year could ask two student also deal geometric series lot popular one year going get put energy arithmetic sequence following definition important far encourage go fast hit pause button make sure get whole thing copied really definition think rather merely copy ing sake getting done really digest definition say say pattern write theres key word day buzz word day fixed amount time one term next cal led arithmetic sequence alright far important definition day need make sure get entire thing copied fixed amount one term next cal led arithmetic sequence good example would sequence written previous slide notice jump one term next want jump first term second term term third third fourth kind pattern following three time get next term could predict fifth term would sixth term would soon could continue perpetuate pattern time special name fixed amount time call quote unquote common difference little funny difference subtraction run room hopefully got whole word notebook dont agree word difference whenever see word difference think subtraction true trying change idea basically second term subtract first term get common difference right sub minus use letter kay letter symbol variable well use common difference thats fixed amount keep time let stake look another example see consider one last slide first example let take look sequence comma comma comma negative comma first five term sequence first thing want want readily say yes well thats first term thats sub sub sub sub indeed arithmetic sequence fixed amount time think really easy one rule anyway word arithmetic word letter make pretty handy remember simply question becomes term well k negative term get next term short cut ever get confused always sub minus sub case minus notice getting negative say positive would incorrect final answer going say de equal negative thats common difference next example want try comma three halves comma halves comma theres first term arithmetic fixed amount time well try sub minus sub case three halves minus give answer common difference aka time compare series sequence said comma comma negative comma negative k another sequence similar particular situation second term minus first term get minus one answer negative case common difference would negative important get correct sign front number right jump example theres two really important formula need know right first one call rule nth term theres theres ways well see future example show might word rule term right important one memorize going say sub equal sub plus common difference times quantity n minus look quick clarification sub first term sequence probably given represent common difference thats weve talking last word thats fixed amount added term term number guess though well call number term looking want fifth term would sub simply substitute sub n actually represent term number term term well definitely practice go want introduce second formula going need know cal led formula finding sum certain number sum certain number one look good one get done writing say sub n course sum represent number want sum going n times quantity sub sub n divided clarification goes sub n sum term course sub first terma sub n last term number term pattern well definitely one well good one right going reference sheet opposed one really memorize put couple asterisk next one bite sized quiz alright really important one memorize right really good example get us going us sequence five comma nine comma dot theyre simply us find rule nth term going refresh memory formula memorize nth term always equal whoops got erased screwed needs sub one well first term plus common difference times quantity n minus one say nth term really first term five common difference much add five get nine thinking add four common difference four quantity n minus one going going distribute well combine like term right got four plus one rule nth term something thats kind worth notice similar equal equation lack better word linear function want compare equal b theyre similar four match es sorry four match es upwith one match es beat alright word little short cut coefficient n true arithmetic sequence coefficient n always equal common difference alright theres little bit working medic sequence kind influence formula slope linear function similar idea theyre going increase rate term term term second example theyre going ask find common difference theyre giving rule term theyre going tell sub n equal plus theres long way really short way problem ill long way first first thing could start expand one first term substitute got term substitute forth notice difference two term could say common difference short cut simply say last slide coefficient n guarantee common difference long arithmetic could instantly say coefficient value without showing work long convinced arithmetic well talk later start mix sequence know whether arithmetic right away long short story look like linear function look like linear function arithmetic sequence little problem theyre find term term comma comma comma first four term given us far term goes thats hard could recognize pattern pattern appear two time could say well let see next term would many need one term turn could say bingo term kind annoying wasnt doable far hundredth term goes two could use technique used keep get could write rule term could refresh memory new like simply substitute first term common difference two could simply substitute n say sub three plus two times minus one dim going go nice slow well say well mean term really three plus two times let see two times going oh boy must could safely say one term going thats consider opposed manually finding term way hundredth term right ready fourth example theyre find seventh term knew ahead time first term equal common difference equal negative x enough information help find seventh term well surely rule term say want first term plus common difference times quantity n minus want seventh term substitute end axes end clean little bit let say seventh term really let see oh guess could combined seven one right first kind brain doesnt make wrong guess answer negative seventh term would negative whats special love term nth term give flexibility overall freedom find term heart desire reason wan ted third term could instantly find snap simply substituting n alright next example going far one us find fifteenth term knew third term sub equal negative plus knew sixth term negative plus whats different compare one last example gave us first term common difference perfect thats exactly need order write formula nth term rule nth term one extra hard didnt give sub one common difference little kind list goal first thing want try find common difference find common difference going write equation formula nth term right substitute n right kind game gon na try find going write equation nth term gon na substitute easy right well wish easy going try give visual image know first term second term right know third term negative fourth term unknown right fifth term unknown know sixth term negative plus get tricky going going conveniently ignore first two term going put box around going energy particular sequence right instead calling negative plus third term going say thats first term right theres second term theres third term theres fourth term remember formula sub n equal sub plus quantity n minus going going say sub sub one plus common difference notice substituted forward n going look like could substitute negative plus sub four substitute negative sub simplify minus get guess trying solve aim trying solve thats strategy works nicely going try add sides alright give negative try subtract sides give plus recap added side took side kind like term last thing going simply divide everybody get plus equal far thing going today definitely going reference little strategy tomorrow class example quite done formed little game problem said going find find going write formula nth term could say sub n equal sub plus let parentheses perhaps negative times quantity n minus remember substituted right write term theyre fifteenth term believe let scroll double check screw let see go yes fifteenth term need get fifteenth term going substitute fifteen n could say sub fifteen equal sub one well actually want call want going tot week one little thing us want scroll back split second look pattern kind thing little bit legal long kind term term said know make told third term let make first term forth forth project forward used fifteenth term thirteenth term first two make life little easier legal long consistent going substitute thirteen come apologize want want fix think easiest way say fifteenth term thats actually thirteenth term based fact sub one going tobe let see said negative four plus five first term red box plus common difference negative three plus going substitute one alright hand full going start clean thing negative plus see right really going distribute get minus plus combining oh boy let say give plus kind like term based red box top really term included first two term tricky example hope able fight way one well work together tomorrow right ladies job going finish one example want find number term following sequence well call comma comma comma comma period mysterious number term fall within dont know exactly many term fall within course theres really long way really mentally tough could fight way could list going try show concise short cut answer know instantly know first term seven know common difference three thats fixed amount keep term know term last term trick want find value n thats goal find n many term sequence secret formula today right sub n first term common difference quantity n minus point weve got try solve n let see equal n minus well combine right side look plus n well subtract got think goes times n equal trying say went way grand total term within sequence alright ladies hope good time let memorize formula nth term arithmetic sequence see tomorrow
