generally differential equation two broad partial ordinary differential equation differential equation partial derivative get function defined term multiple variable take derivative respect one example equation take partial derivative z respect x partial derivative z respect get one partial derivative equation variable partial derivative first order second order found first order partial derivative z respect x took derivative respect variable wan ted find second order derivative would take derivative dealing partial derivative take partial derivative respect variable give four second order partial see kept going taking higher order derivative wed get two first order four second order partial derivative eight third order partial derivative broad category differential equation ordinary differential easiest way think ordinary differential equation know theyre equation contain something like include verb command mean take derivative whatever follow hand noun mean derivative respect literally derivative function ordinary differential equation generally classified order first order ordinary differential equation first order derivative like higher order derivative sa second order ordinary differential equation second order derivative higher order derivative sin word know order differential equation based contain snow let talk different type ordinary differential separable exact differential equation type ordinary first second higher order differential equation let focus first order function sa first order linear differential equation look like might equation thats linear differential equation doesnt look exactly like manipulate exact way get equation form derivative hereby function x function x linear differential equation first order separable differential equation usually look like could easily one look different point see whether separate separate variable know separable differential equation equation multiply sides x multiply sides variable separate left x variable right thats know sure separable differential equation way regular derivative learn cal c really separable differential equation stake simple single variable function cal c take derivative get multiply sides x youve got separate variable left x right even simple derivative really separable first order exact differential equation look like know equation might format start get format exact differential equation looking function term x function term x derivative value havent even tal ked homogeneous nonhomogeneous differential equation certainly exhaustive list every kind differential equation least overview common type differential equation youd study part calculus class beginning differential
