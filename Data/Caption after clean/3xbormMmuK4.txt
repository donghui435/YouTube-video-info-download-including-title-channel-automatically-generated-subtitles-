make geometric multiplying ratio number get next term going show formula thats one sub n equal sub times r n minus power sub first term r ratio whatever term want find want find term n equal going back example starting see n equal first term n equal thats second term n equal third sub value first term see little subscript thats term second term value term wan ted find let see one two three four fifth term n equal five would three would multiply two twice three times four times five already star ted three first term multiply common ratio one less number times already took four times thats minus one comes ratio call ratio call ratio take number term divided previous term divided equal divided equal two six divided three equal two take term divided one give ratio thats multiplying move forward next term say want find term well could keep multiplying two thats one way thats way would like sub equal sub n equal sub n minus mean go back previous term add add case multiplying righto kay thats recursive way write formula keep going back one term see mine one multiply two want sixth term go back six minus one fifth term multiply two explicit formula take right want find term start first term three multiplying two nine times already three get tenth term multiply one less time going tobe three times two ninth thats value tenth term plot point like draw axis term number one three term number two six term number three twelve see going faster faster rate actually exponential exponential curve whereas arithmetic linear going constant rate common difference multiplying ratio see look like exponential equation variable exponent thats work give list well happen give two term like fifth term eighth term five tell us geometric sequence find term handle well going going write system going going say fifth term first term dont know ratio also dont know minus going say right eighth term eighth term five dont know first term dont know ratio know minus k two variable solve system going something maybe little bit different youve seen going actually divide divide see cancel oneanother seven minus four divide base subtract exponent remember r cube equal divided divide fraction like multiplying reciprocal five fourth times going reduce five goes five goes times equal r cube take cube root sides see r equal one fourth know ratio put one equation maybe ill put back one right get eighty equal sub one fourth power sub one times one multiply sides excuse get first term want calculator real quick times thousand four hundred eighty twenty thousand four hundred eighty put back together weve got sub n equal first term thousand four hundred eighty ratio one fourth n minus one power formula explicit formula want find twelfth term sub put
