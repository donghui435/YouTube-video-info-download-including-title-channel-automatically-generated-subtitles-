let us analyze construction perpendicular bisector line segment fix length compass little half length kept point made arc b compass length keep compass point b make two intersect previous two call point b say line perpendicular bisector segment b let call c let join c b c ad two thing need prove first p equal b p second angle right angle able two thing say line c perpendicular bisector first thing know four length equal compass width unchanged look triangle c b triangle da b special two ways first isosceles mean pair triangle congruent second congruent condition side side side angle c b congruent angle da b corresponding angle congruent triangle angle c ba congruent angle ba corresponding angle mean four angle congruent look triangle c ad similar way isosceles congruent triple condition four angle congruent final step look four triangle ca p c b p p pall four triangle congruent si condition take instance consider two triangle two triangle congruent p equal b p corresponding four angle congruent four triangle congruent four together add degree one degree say line perpendicular bisector segment b
