k know people arent green bean like plus remind vector green bean like little arrow urge line flow direction maybe little wavy represent ing flow river something maybe complete little maybe bean could represent wind bean would high magnitude vector saying theres strong wind direction short low magnitude bean would mean low wind speed could hurricane casserole dish long bean high wind speed flowing counterclockwise near center towards outer storm center would shor test bean showing calm eye storm oh wondering bean like vector field might shape flow vector dont theyre usually shown straight thats straight represent whats happening single point like tiny point bit wind travel one direction bean point direction tiny bit wind certain speed length bean bean dont shape direction magnitude mean bean direction magnitude legitimate vector arrow plotted graph set two one complex number orange slice cut certain angle thickness shouting compass direction precise decibel admit huge fan individual vector sitting without meaning context one string bean make casserole case may field vector awesome curve pattern context real world meaning field perm eating casserole dish right gravitational field instance gravitational force affecting string bean towards earth could use string create vector field casserole gravitational field currently course mean lining point since theyre affected basically amount gravity length cooking high altitude sure cut string bean shorter negligible amount another favorite field mine also currently perm eating string electromagnetic field giant bar magnet coaster trivet thing maybe id want casserole show magnetic field actually point near magnet would vector curve around like iron filings put magnetic field bean would show force get magnet goes north south want true life dont magnet could put equal sized string pointing way make sure casserole always pointing north might make difficult pass around table think dish passing simplicity sake science mathematics whatever speaking also invent vector field making rule vector point like said point choose take x comma give point vector thats comma x point vector negative negative negative negative get negative simple get awesome vector field vector kind whoosh crash whoosh anyway theres lots stuff going go ahead pour stuff get thing may look inspiring yet far done essential part awesome oniony topping got trick even show next video
