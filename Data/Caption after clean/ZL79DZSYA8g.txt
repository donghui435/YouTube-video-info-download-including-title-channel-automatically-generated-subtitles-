welcome little issue people balance point centroid figure mean ah let take square example specific measure square cut sort heavy thick uniformity like sheet metal sheet plywood something question particular point square guess answer center always tobe center square could balance latch figure point name weve sort vertical rod something like could balance square point answer yes ideal world must convinced center square would balance point thin rod needle nail something squared sitting right tip center square balance ideally people call balance point centroid square right bring little bit square actually balancing right point balance along line like youve like edge trying draw way measure thats like knife edge goes line whoops template knife well certainly would also balance along point giving point balance going help able balance right single point certainly bounce whole line next census equal left right symmetrical believe square going bounce centroid thats going also bounce along knife edge goes centroid thats fine right paradox equilateral triangle also balance point let quickly draw one fairly decent way people probably guest balance point equilateral triangle going like think center three altitude triangle meet equilateral know cut equilateral triangle nonetheless perfect one try bounce sort thin rod sitting air bet could doit least theoretical ideal world whole thing going balance perfectly point mean took knife edge gave interest balance point balance like knife edge like template draw knife edge good sorry certainly balance along whole line point one single point giving point balance dont get help make worse mean equilateral triangle balance long say line aswell make sense see theres equal amount area left edge air right balance perfectly period people paradox would also balance along edge goes say way goes balance point giving point balance zoning dont make worse mean triangle going balance line supposedly parallel one sides triangle boring actually look let see paint man see two claim problematic area side line equal side line fact actually draw pretty well convince draw three decide thats good picture totally bad mean dont need bad ill even draw guy actually divided equilateral triangle nine smaller triangle look like right area one side balancing line knife edge one two three area side got one two three four five area strange first glance whoops thats bad sir bill making sorry give area side balancing line four magically area side line people argue theres way triangle balance across line right yet time line goes centroid balancing line paradoxical question doesnt make sense dont dont triangle balanced along knife edge parallel one side triangle simple answer really physics question also math question know physics fulcrum rest id like explanation paradox anyone understand really little basic math dont give calculus convincing argument ninth tenth grade algebra student could understand would convince triangle either doesnt balance knife edge thats paradoxical question go apparently balance balancing dont dont equal airing either side mysterious question thanks much
