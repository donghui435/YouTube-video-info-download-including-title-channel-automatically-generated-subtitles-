hi everyone today going talk find dimension cylinder minimize surface area complete problem well draw picture problem write know identify optimization constraint equation use derivative optimization equation find dimension let take look particular optimization problem weve told cylindrical must made hold one liter oil weve ked find dimension minimize cost metal used make optimization problem first thing want draw diagram youve told write much information weve drawn diagram cylinder weve radius h height cylinder weve also written one liter equal thousand cubic centimeter area formula cylinder pie r h plus two pie r squared also know volume cylinder pier squared h really quickly case dont remember remember area formula two pie r circumference circle times h height canso give outside material used make side pie r area circle give top bottom multiple two account top bottom together simplify get two pie r h plus two pie r squared formula volume area circle times height area base times height give us total volume weve written information weve given next step identify constraint equation optimization equation optimization problem like always going need equation optimize also need constraint equation weve ked minimize cost metal going surface area defined surface area surface area mean optimization equation area equation let go ahead say area equation optimization equation constraint equation equation us told cylindrical made hold one liter oil thats constraint weve given problem us optimize area surface area minimize cost metal minimize cost surface area within constraint within condition volume hold one liter thousand cubic centimeter volume equation constraint equation next step figure reduce optimization equation one variable optimization equation r radius h need get rid one way going get rid one constraint equation one plugging optimization equation let go ahead solve constraint equation value equation either r h case let go ahead solve h really easy plug area equation got h right way well plugging one thousand cubic centimeter volume know volume well set equal pie r squared h well solve h obviously solve h well divide sides pie r squared well get one thousand divided pie r squared weve solve h go ahead plug back area equation say area equal two pie r h solve one thousand pie r squared plus two pie r squared optimization equation surface area form one variable r weve got one variable need simplify take derivative set derivative equal solve r r give us radius minimize surface area let go ahead simplify first well see get pie cancel get r cancel numerator squared cancel denominator left two thousand divided r plus two pie r squared let go ahead need take derivative weve simplified much possible ahead make little easier well call two thousand r negative one remember move variable denominator numerator sign exponent positive negative two thousand r negative one plus two pie r squared comfortable obviously use quotient rule figure going take derivative prime well get negative two thousand r negative two plus four pie r move r negative two back denominator well get negative two thousand actually let go ahead make second term dont lead negative well get four pie r minus two thousand r squared derivative equation need set equal zero solve r set equal zero let time go ahead find common denominator order common denominator going multiplying first term r squared r well get four pie r cube combine fraction minus two thousand r squared see right hand side going equal zero whenever numerator equal zero denominator undefined however denominator undefined mean r equal zero know r cant equal zero talking three dimensional real space r equal zero cylinder doesnt exist almost discount really looking numerator equal zero let go ahead factor four well get four times pie r cube minus five hundred obviously see right hand side equal zero pie r cube minus five hundred equal zero really ignore four divide sides four go away add five hundred sides well get five hundred r cube divide sides pie well get r cube equal five hundred divided pie solve r taking cube root sides well get r cube root five hundred divided pie know must radius surface area want find height well go ahead plug r height equation clean well get one thousand divided pie times r squared get cube root five hundred divided pie squared thats really going give us one thousand divided pie times five hundred pie two third power dimension h r minimize surface area therefore minimize cost metal used construct hope found video helpful like video subscribe notified future video
