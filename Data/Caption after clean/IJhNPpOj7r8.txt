circumcenter point concurrency three sides triangle going going perpendicular bisector side triangle side triangle side triangle theyre going cross one point thats circumcenter let walk construction dont three two enough find point concurrency let go ahead show want want find perpendicular bisector side right want open compass halfway thats key want want draw arc line segment like want also line segment student theyll theyll draw one continuous arc thats fine well go ahead way gon na go end point like theyre thing see weve got two point intersection going draw line thats going perpendicular bisector side triangle draw always draw little bit longer think need dont go back try know make longer go theres perpendicular bisector see thats right angle side triangle go ahead rotate triangle let see find perpendicular bisector side gon na process want make sure open compass little bit halfway half length segment gon na go ahead make arc line segment gon na make continuous arc keep simple us like see theyre crossing going go ahead draw line segment two point thats going perpendicular draw accurate thats perpendicular see side length length see two perpendicular bisector crossing theyre crossing right point right circumcenter draw third perpendicular bisector third side would also cross point keep simple drew two going going use compass going measure distance point concurrency circumcenter one vertices triangle like distance vertices triangle going draw circle around triangle whats going happen gon na barely touch edge circle basically whats happening circle circumscribed around triangle triangle inscribe inside circle reason call circumcenter draw know line point vertices triangle going congruent radii circle theyre going equal oneanother pretty neat construction take time really accurate find going know lie right circle comes really neat hope understand work circumcenter video put together subscribe channel check tube math tutor ing look forward helping future video ill talk soon
