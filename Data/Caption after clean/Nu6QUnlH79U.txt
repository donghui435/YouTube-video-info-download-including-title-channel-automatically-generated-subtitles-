alright another example sort know trying figure trig function could use bes test describe given graph assume thing suppose negative pi pi pi sort general shape well look lot like graph regular oh let see either tangent cotangent believe lot like plain old cotangent x remember cotangent pi pi piso negative piet c remember cotangent normally kind place sort actually call would whats cal led known inflection point kind sort bending upwards sort sort like know theres theres sort change indirection bend graph right normally happen zero pi sort sort change way graph bending alright problem theres equal cotangent x reason sort pointing new graph similar plain old cotangent x notice sort point way bending inflection point cal led notice happen sat negative two look like original look like graph cotangent would like take graph move two well move graph shift graph vertically either add subtract number either want move subtract number want move case want move graph two simply like original graph equal cotangent x well subtract two simply move graph would say thats probably know rough sketch would say probably exactly equation would describe graph dont need coefficient x change theres sort horizontal shift dont toto add subtract anything x inside parentheses get nothing bad kind hey look like original cotangent move little bit
