another little fun problem since division problem turned much fun multiplication division one another one somebody pointed meso think dont know let take look soso negative twenty well certainly equal negative argument break negative gon na break left think gon na write minus certainly still get negative right side gon na write gon na rewrite thing little bit mo reim gon na rewrite squared gon na rewrite times right side gon na rewrite squared gon na rewrite times alright well think gon na gon na add sides number gon na add sides gon na add right thats weve got far well actually think factor little bit couple thing know check works gon na leave squared alone pretty easily gon na write times breaking little bit gon na rewrite right side gon na thing weve got squared gon na gon na write times plus know basically tube nine halves would cancel hey give us back nine right far good well reason factor nicely actually factor minus minus right side gon na factor minus minus right well tell us well weve got minus minus well mean minus equal could add sides tell us equal well subtract sides tell us equal proof complete
