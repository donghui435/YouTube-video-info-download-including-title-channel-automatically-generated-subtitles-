well welcome video going second half lesson recall first half lesson taking equation standard form getting form find polynomial lesson work way backwards gon na start form expand standard form polynomial see original equation would would graph would give us root polynomial standard form going require little bit work little bit algebra multiplying polynomial together want make sure patience really difficult let jump thing looking example example gon na looking writing polynomial know look example though really important factor theorem x minus r factor polynomial long r zero give us negative write factor x minus remember minus negative becomes positive first one x minus negative x plus thats one polynomial factor theorem x minus would also factor polynomial aswell x minus set factor equal zero wed end getting negative goal equation standard form gon na go multiply together use method choose personally like box method x box method box method create box gon na set factor snow doesnt matter two multiply first want put x plus x minus want first could put outside box gon na multiply together get standard form couple part cant multiply three mean way could get really think think easy two separate part multiplying together multiply x times x get x squared x times would positive negative times x negative x negative times negative multiply first two end x squared negative negative minus x still multiply times x minus box thats grid side thats got going two term x minus side three column x squared minus x minus multiply together get would minus x squared would minus x x squared would plus x would positive combine like term get final answer standard form x x cube stays minus squared minus x squared though combine x squared negative x plus x negative plus equation say would cube minus squared minus thats start key start form form multiply get answer standard form let start looking next one together ill multiply together one zero well put form x minus x would x plus would x minus multiply order want want multiply two binomial together first distribute x first binomial multiply two together doesnt matter personally might want multiply two binomial together dont know whatever choose dont pause video hit play ready check see correct answer ended ended multiplying together x plus times x minus distributed want first binomial x plus dont binomial otherwise end wrong answer multiply together end x squared positive get negative x negative combine like term get x squared minus x minus dont forget multiply everything x get polynomial equal x cube minus x squared minus hopefully got answer times instead given us theyre going instead give us graph maybe graph equation calculator find either way graph see cross x axis root thing let start negative negative positive next want put form form going use factor theorem x minus negative x plus x minus negative x plus wed x minus negative becomes x plus finally would x minus multiply together could either left right wan ted personally would group pair first maybe multiply first two last two notice one two conjugate remember multiply two conjugate something significant happen let look forgot want set box remember happen go ahead jump short cut youve got happen want follow special unique conjugate x plus x minus multiply get x squared x negative x get negative notice minus multiply two together get x squared minus still want multiply still x plus x plus still gon na multiply together let actually next gon na take ill gon na multiply together well take x plus put outside box x want put outside oh way going back didnt recognize short cut multiply first term last get answer x times x x squared times negative negative works conjugate multiply way get x squared positive x would get combine dont forget x squared minus multiply combine like term get x squared x together make x plus still finished yet multiply two together gon na multiply setting grid x squared minus x squared plus plus put multiply together get x fourth cube squared squared negative x negative combine like term get final answer equal x fourth got careful combining like term might habit thinking always like term theres x cube stays x cube six x squared minus four x squared like term together two x squared x doesnt like term neither would final answer kind along process nothing really difficult though dont guy take couple minute want guy work one hear count see little bit easier way assume x axis point kind hard see integer x intercept want guy figure four x intercept gon na use find form write answer standard form pause video hit play ready check see correct answer let see first step want find looking hopefully loo ked correctly could thrown entire answer getting wrong would negative form would x minus could put x front middle doesnt matter though would write could x plus x minus x minus order going multiply together two part multiply get two part get final answer x times x plus give x squared plus part going end getting outside box put get x squared minus minus x plus combine like term get x squared minus x plus going multiply together set two three buy get x fourth minus x cube plus x x x squared gon na get rather large get cube x squared plus x combine like term get answer x fourth minus x x squared plus x well lesson remember first part took equation standard form form find part lesson gave us got wrote standard form good luck work assignment
