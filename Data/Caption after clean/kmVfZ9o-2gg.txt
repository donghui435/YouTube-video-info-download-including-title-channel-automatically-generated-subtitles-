hi welcome math antic sin first video percent learned percent special fraction always bottom number simple enough bring important question percent always bottom number use percent situation involve score test test question mean get question right theres testor friend say l l give candy mean give candy bar got talking thing bigger hear news like watching pretty sure fact percent used time describe situation total involved either less work well key understanding percent used situation sis realize percent equivalent might already know equivalent fraction fraction represent amount value different top bottom number sa simple example equivalent fraction fraction represent value one half use different percent used even total n percent equivalent fraction tell much total case one half another equivalent fraction would half learned last video percent candy bar half candy bar see even clearly let think test got score fraction since test really actual score must equivalent fraction bottom number even though know top number would figure know actual score equivalent show let review one easiest ways get fraction equivalent another fraction multiply top bottom fraction number result equivalent original fraction example fraction could make equivalent fraction multiplying top bottom thing top bottom result equivalent top bottom fraction equivalent fraction sand also make equivalent fraction dividing top bottom number really simplify fraction example fraction could divide top bottom since theyre even number son top divided bottom divided equivalent fraction know figure actual test score notice relationship fraction bottom exactly half could go dividing mean thing top number divide l l get top number equivalent fraction since divided equivalent know actual test score must know thinking actual score leave like teacher convert percentage well one important reason converting thing percent make easier compare example suppose student took five different test school test different number score got test score look really different easy tell well student see score change time convert score equivalent fraction bottom word equivalent percent form wow much easier compare score son first test student got half correct better test took finally last test reason percent help us easily compare thing alway scale fact percent similar scale always hearing noise crowd cheering come come catch yes see oh oh scale awesome play like scale percent give us way quantify thing common scale easier us relate especially helpful dealing complicated like either really small really big remember example football used describe many like watching well actual might look something like lot people fraction easy imagine equivalent fraction much easier imagine tell every like watching know percent really special kind equivalent fraction always bottom number let see example common probably memorize already saw equivalent equivalent fraction sand equivalent fraction also really common equivalent percent little different fraction decimal mean percent also usually round video knowing percent equivalent fraction really help understand kind math problem involve always sure practice v e learned exercise section thanks watching math antic l l see ya next time learn
