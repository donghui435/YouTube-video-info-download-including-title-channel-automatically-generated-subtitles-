going talk something really important definition sine cosine might remember geometry right triangle sine cosine start aright triangle well label three sides x z acute angle theta right angle defined cosine theta side adjacent theta divided hypotenuse adjacent mean side thats next theta hypotenuse long side right triangle mean x z sine defined side opposite theta hypotenuse soy z problem definition works angle mean degree else triangle wont make sense one thing extend definition include angle angle look like standard position standard position draw angle vertex origin plane initial side terminal side think angle rotation initial terminal side starting rotating angle theta ending add angle standard position unit circle circle radius x squared plus squared equal circle get bearing circle radius going pass point pass point negative angle want want mark point terminal unit circle point x define cosine x value sine value point course unique depend uniquely angle theta different angle theta going get different sine cosine value idea allow us measure sine cosine angle work acute angle theta first quadrant work zero degree degree angle power unit circle definition work angle well rest trigonometry course
