hi welcome math antic lesson gon na learn negative little first get discourage take get learn negative first need start whole remember whole right set number line starting zero counting one way infinity lot half story number line really goes used seeing number line starting zero going right number line also goes left part number negative negative like mirror image right side number line call positive number sand zero special number separates positive negative way combine infinity negative infinity number zero entire set get special name math cal led integer see negative look like positive difference negative sign front negative sign look like minus sign fact wan ted could write positive sign plus front positive save time assume number n sign front positive positive default know negative need learn compare math mean saying two bigger smaller saying equal use greater less equal probably already pretty good positive ask bigger know bigger ked compare two negative integer bigger ah negative little tricky especially first time learning used bigger see really tempting think must bigger negative actually smaller less negative help understand let look number line start zero number line move right keep getting bigger bigger go greater greater greater go opposite direction instead left go left get smaller less less less exact rule apply negative side number line also get bigger go right get smaller go left since left side actually smaller like think like positive side number line positive bigger negative side number line negative smaller use idea matter positive side positive bigger negative side negative smaller keep mind anyone every give negative part pretty good negative much alright positive integer right side zero number line mean greater zero negative integer left side zero number line mean less hold less zero number less zero n zero mean nothing ah good question first hard see could less zero example help understand let say want use integer measure many meter sea level small island island sea level island sea island happen exactly height sea level use integer zero show height compare sea level island even sea level surface measurement supposed tell us many sea level fortunately negative problem say height compare sea level negative example three different amount money first brother next brother last brother actually dad number use represent much money negative dollar sand temperature another great example use zero degree describe temperature water freeze warmer colder temperature could negative like negative negative useful real world help describe thing know negative work let see compare two include zero moment basically three l l either need compare two positive two negative one positive one negative integer already know compare two positive right number line go bigger greater greater greater also really easy compare positive integer negative integer positive number always bigger negative number positive right side number line negative left less less less tricky situation compare two negative think one left number great way identify number would normal positive positive side number line realize negative negative negative negative smaller negative smaller alright video learned negative used describe thing real world like positive side zero number line whole along negative counterpart form set call also learned compare go right number line integer get bigger go left get integer first sure practice v e really got always thanks watching math antic l l see ya next time learn
