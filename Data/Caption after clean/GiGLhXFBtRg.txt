want quick refresher median triangle sand also explore interesting property useful think future let draw arbitrary triangle thats good enough median triangle well see triangle three themis line connect vertex triangle mid point opposite opposite sides mid point look right length equal length median close enough course three vertices well three start vertex want go mid point opposite side look right blue line right another median completely straight line think get idea could also point right line vertex opposite see mid point opposite side draw line could draw straight er line let draw think get idea median triangle whats neat median three median always intersect one point pretty neat property one point intersect cal led centroid actually physical say made iron toss well even toss centroid would actually center mass let say iron say right iron triangle centroid right iron triangle center mass would centroid assuming uniform density throw iron triangle would rotate around point assuming rotational motion would rotate around centroid around center mass anyway point video focus physics throwing iron point want show neat property median sand property pick distance centroid mid point opposite side distance going half distance distance right distance right another way think distance length entire median distance right length entire median let prove dont take thing faith ill draw arbitrary triangle ill two dimensional triangle ill three least mind math little bit easier general whenever n dimensional figure embed n plus dimension sit make math little bit easier actual tetrahedron problem could actually embed four dimension sand would make math easier much harder visualize didnt way let arbitrary triangle let say vertex vertex vertex making assumption saying isosceles equilateral anything arbitrary triangle let say right ill call x axis axis know used swapping two axes doesnt make difference let call right along call b let call cand connect point triangle like centroid triangle especially three centroid triangle going average vertices centroid going average vertices right going plus plus three add divide going b plus plus add b three average b thing average going c c proving right could verify going average figure line line line centroid center mass triangle average want use use right compare distance compare distance orange distance yellow remember point right median bottom side right going average two point sand plus going plus going b going plus know point point point calculate yellow distance calculate orange distance let calculate orange distance going equal square root take difference point squared minus squared thats going squared b minus squared thats b squared c minus c negative want square going positive squared right c minus negative negative c square going get c squared thats orange distance let calculate want express let express little bit simpler thing square root squared plus b squared plus squared square root equal let thing yellow distance going equal square root minus minus thats thing minus squared squared minus b b square get plus b squared finally minus c squared thats going c squared get common denominator c squared thing plus squared rewrite square root squared plus b squared plus squared see distance right multiply orange distance going get multiply orange distance divide get yellow distance always going twice distance general possible way assumed nothing triangle remember little property centroid intersection median away vertex length median away mid point opposite side use property probably use bunch anyway hopefully found interesting
