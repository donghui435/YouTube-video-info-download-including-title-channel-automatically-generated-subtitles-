example trigonometry gon na dealing roof nice example may probably use well roof span five thousand two hundred millimeter also eve overhang son side roof pitch degree thing going wanting find outwith roof first gon na heart roof goes ill draw little triangle deal triangle approximate sort triangle ill move first triangle going deal high trying find addition dont work know actual air length going half much roof actually span five thousand two hundred divided two two thousand six hundred first thing trying find next thing gon na try find rafter length ill draw right angle triangle yeah right angle triangle little bit different last one drew show second ill move first ill move well deal well know said slightly different angle pitch length trying find one bottom going slightly different time include sit take account rafter actually run right eaves ill include million two thousand six hundred plus six hundred three thousand two hundred cool two thing going find may remember last video trigonometry couple first thing label sides next thing work trig function sine cos tan substitute value nice short calculate way remember side opposite actual angle known officer put officer alongside hypotenuse dealing adjacent one work really sine cos way remember ing old egg charge always back oh gon na looking opposite adjacent one gon na tan ill write tan theta opposite adjacent remember feeder angle ill rewrite substituting value theta degree equal opposite opposite x adjacent right last video also sho wed id work x would write thing wrote last video three legal six sure step may want review last video people done looking x x six seater would get times x going two times theres two times equal choose calculator tan times equal one actually ill thats heart work next day working rafter got triangle first thing label sides right dealing opposite year gon na dealing hypotenuse adjacent next thing work tree anomaly function one deal h ill write closed beta equal concern actually degree equal adjacent hypotenuse right equal dealing trying one wed divided gon na go customer divided cos gram equal jump three thousand three hundred divided doesnt look good better hit eagle back much better three four seven six three four seven thats gon na rifle length three half thats pretty good last thing could also could work little angle ill say quickly bit information angle degree angle degree yeah angle triangle add degree take away get answer aint lot beer gon na anyway thats trigonometry used real world example hope help understand trigonometry little bit better cant see time
