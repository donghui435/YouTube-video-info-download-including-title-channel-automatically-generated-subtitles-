well straight edge compass tool available didnt good paper completely different approach take construction well much less classical less tal ked use folding paper instead straight edge compass think folding paper nothing first cant ever never able fold circle onto paper ever straight think strong er set tool intuitive answer must weak er sometimes intuitive answer right answer let jump right show trisect angle folding paper id like essentially straight edge two point previously somehow fold paper two point crease exactly thing connect ing straight edge even better perpendicular bisector single step fold paper two point cover crease perpendicular line segment connect ing point cut exactly half covered trisect angle first create angle right angle interesting trisect right angle straight edge compass probably important point make theres angle whatsoever trisect trisect arbitrary angle ninety degree trisect construct thirty degree angle want create arbitrary angle job easy ill fold paper bottom crease right corner angle arbitrarily dont know big ill try draw line inside crease gon na trisect going trisect first fold paper half fold bottom top match exactly fold bottom half crease halfway two crease one one trick ill mark two bottom yep z tip second one point edge paper thats halfway fold paper point tip angle line crease point halfway line angle going fold fiddle around found alignment going put hand crease line take pen mark point right tip go tokay open another important point mark crease last fold intersect bottom line might already see going brad fold connect tip angle marked point fold connect tip angle marked point magic brad thats thats since folding check prove check folding crease see match es crease see match es three want prove exercise doable remember congruent power straight edge compass didnt z exactly good question trick one step taking two point lining two allow step reasonable step mean paper easy key translate step way told context straight edge compass crease two parabola solve equation find tangent two need something cubic brad one thing beyond one thing thats beyond turns term constructible construct addition subtraction multiplication root cube powerful geometry z powerful geometry even better give cubic equation construct solution could solve cubic equation formula really really big ugly hard plug solve simple folding mechanism measuring solution example sho wed square root two sho wed three show one third turns involve fraction square root sand addition subtraction theres problem cube guy proved never able cube root
