In this lesson, students learn the definition of a central angle, and that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Students also learn the definitions of a minor arc, a major arc, a semicircle, adjacent arcs, and congruent arcs. Students also learn the arc addition postulate, and are asked to find the missing measures of arcs and angles in given figures using the concepts introduced in this lesson.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Y9D0v0x4H8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Y9D0v0x4H8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Y9D0v0x4H8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["central", "angle", "angles", "circle", "circles", "arc", "measure"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Arcs and Central Angles - MathHelp.com - Geometry Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on arcs and central angles, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
