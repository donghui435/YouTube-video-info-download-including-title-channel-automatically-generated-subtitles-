Students also learn that the scale factor is ratio of the lengths of two corresponding sides. Students are then asked to use these concepts to find missing angle measures and missing side lengths in similar figures.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9IUI3jtSEWU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9IUI3jtSEWU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9IUI3jtSEWU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["Similar", "Triangle", "Polygons", "similar", "similarity", "triangle", "geometry", "help", "triangles", "math"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Similar Figures - Similar Polygons - MathHelp.com", "description": "For a complete lesson on similar figures and similar polygons, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
