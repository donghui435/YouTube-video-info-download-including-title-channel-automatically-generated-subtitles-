Logarithmic equations are equations with logarithms in them. To solve a natural logarithmic equation, we first isolate the logarithm part of the equation. After we have isolated the logarithm part of the equation, we then get rid of the logarithm. This is done by raising both side of the equation as an exponent to the (natural) exponential function (e). This cancels out the natural logarithm, we can then solve the resulting equation.\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/mrbrianmclogan?sub_confirmation=1\nWebsite: http://www.freemathvideos.com\nLearn from Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/user/brianmclogan2/\n\nFollow me on \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/freemathvideos/\nTwitter https://twitter.com/mrbrianmclogan\n#solvelogarithmic #logarithms", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h6OSBOdaLfI/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h6OSBOdaLfI/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h6OSBOdaLfI/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h6OSBOdaLfI/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h6OSBOdaLfI/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Brian McLogan", "tags": ["How to solve a logarithmic equation", "solve", "solving", "logs", "logarithmic equation", "one to one", "solving logarithmic equations", "how to", "lnx = -1", "solving logarithmic equations ln", "solving natural logarithmic equations", "brian mclogan", "equations", "exponential", "exponential equation", "exponential equations using logarithms", "exponents", "free math videos", "how to solve an exponential equation", "how to solve exponential equations with logarithms", "math", "mathematics", "solving an exponential equation"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Solving a natural logarithm for the given problem", "description": "Learn how to solve natural logarithmic equations.
