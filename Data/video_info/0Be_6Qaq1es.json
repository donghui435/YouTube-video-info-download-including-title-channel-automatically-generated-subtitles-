Check out this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos\n\nHere is a brief description of calculus, integration and differentiation and one example of where it is useful: deriving new physics. In this video I start with a very simple derivation which shows the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy, and then show a simple introduction to integration and differentiation.\n\nWhen I learned physics at University one of the most satisfying experiences was getting to grips with calculus enough to use it to derive equations as it allowed me to wield mathematics to describe the world, which felt awesome.\n\nI have posters available to buy here: https://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman\nI have also made versions available for educational use which you can find here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/\n\nThanks so much to my supporters on Patreon.
