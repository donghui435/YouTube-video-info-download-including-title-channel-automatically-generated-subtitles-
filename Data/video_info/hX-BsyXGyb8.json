Students learn that the mean of a given data set is the sum of the numbers in the data set divided by however many numbers there are in the data set. For example, in the data set {9, 1, 6, 5, 1, 13, 11, 2}, the mean is (9 + 1 + 6 + 5 + 1 + 13 + 11 + 2) divided by 8, or 48 divided by 8, which is 6. As review, students are also asked to find the median, mode, and range of given data sets.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hX-BsyXGyb8/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hX-BsyXGyb8/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hX-BsyXGyb8/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hX-BsyXGyb8/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hX-BsyXGyb8/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["mean", "in", "math", "statistics", "number", "term", "definition", "mode", "range", "median", "pre", "algebra", "help"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Central Tendency | Mean Median Mode Range | MathHelp.com", "description": "Need a custom math course?
