In this lesson, students learn that the formula for the volume of a prism is length times width times height, so the volume of a rectangular prism that has a length of 25 inches, a width of 4 inches, and a height of 9 inches, is 25 times 4 times 9, or 900 cubic inches. Students also learn that the formula for the volume of a cube is side length cubed, and the formula for the volume of a pyramid is 1/3 times the area of the base times the height of the pyramid. Students are then asked to find the volume of prisms, cubes, and pyramids.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YjGVFPtNTHw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YjGVFPtNTHw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YjGVFPtNTHw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["volume", "prism", "rectangular", "find", "how", "formula", "surface", "area", "right", "prisms", "cubes", "geometry", "pre", "algebra"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Volume of a Cube - MathHelp.com - Math Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on volume, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
