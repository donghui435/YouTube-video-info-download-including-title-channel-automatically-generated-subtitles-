In this lesson, students learn to add unlike fractions by first finding a common denominator. For example, to add 1/2 + 1/3, first find the common denominator of 2 and 3, or the Least Common Multiple of 2 and 3, which is 6. Then multiply the numerator and denominator of 1/2 by 3, to get the equivalent fraction 3/6, and multiply the numerator and denominator of 1/3 by 2, to get the equivalent fraction 2/6. Next, add the like fractions, 3/6 + 2/6, to get 5/6. So 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6. Students also learn to subtract unlike fractions by following the same process that is used when adding unlike fractions.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GvyMUkxDbcE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GvyMUkxDbcE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GvyMUkxDbcE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["adding", "subtracting", "fraction", "fractions", "addition", "subtraction", "unlike", "denominator", "denominators", "least"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Lowest Common Denominator - MathHelp.com - Pre Algebra Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on lowest common denominator, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
