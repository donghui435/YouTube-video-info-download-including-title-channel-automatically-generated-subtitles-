When the two events are mutually exclusive (cannot both happen at the same time), this is very straightforward, because it is just the sum of the two individual probabilities.  However, when the events are not mutually exclusive, you need to be more careful!  In this video we use an example of drawing a single card from a shuffled deck to describe these two different scenarios.  We discuss the general rule for finding the probability of A or B and use a Venn Diagram to illustrate it.  Then it turns out the the mutually exclusive case is just a special case of the general rule, which is quite clear by looking at the Venn Diagram.\n\nA useful dose of Maths for everyone by Dr Sarada Herke.\n\nLinks:\nhttp://youtu.be/1PBwJOC7nNg -  Math Skills: Solving Exp.
