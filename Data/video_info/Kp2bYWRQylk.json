Continue learning at this video's sponsor https://brilliant.org/dos\n\nLots of people find mathematical equations intimidating because they don't make sense. But they are not hard to understand if you follow a few steps, anyone can learn to read them. And it is well worth it because they are so incredibly useful to describe everything in math and physics. If you already know I'm sure you know someone who might like this video, I'm going to send it to my family who are less mathematically inclined than me.\n\nThe steps you need to know are: 1. Find the variables, 2. Work out what all of the different mathematical symbols mean, 3. Wok out what order you would perform the mathematical operations if you were going to plug numbers in to the equations. These steps really help you get your head around what an equation is telling you. Also, don't be scared about the greek letters, they do just the same thing as normal letters, they either represent constants or variables.\n\nThe Math Notation Cheat Sheet is here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/40544016221/in/dateposted-public/\nAnd available to buy here: https://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman/works/30597060-mathematics-notation-cheat-sheet\nGet high res versions by supporting me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/domainofscience\n\nPOSTERS: I have other posters available to buy here: https://www.redbubble.com/people/dominicwalliman\n \nI have also made a version available for educational use which you can find here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/95869671@N08/?\n\nThanks so much to my supporters on Patreon.
