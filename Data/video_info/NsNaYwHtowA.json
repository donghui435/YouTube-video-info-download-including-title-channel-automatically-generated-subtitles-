In this lesson, students learn that when the dimensions of a figure are increased or decreased to create a new figure that is similar to the original figure, the transformation is called a dilation. Students are then asked to determine whether a given transformation on a coordinate system represents a dilation. Students are also asked to graph a dilation of a given figure on a coordinate system by multiplying all of the coordinates of the vertices of the figure by a given number.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NsNaYwHtowA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NsNaYwHtowA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NsNaYwHtowA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["dilation", "dilations", "geometry", "transformation", "transformations"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Math Dilations - MathHelp.com - Pre Algebra Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on math dilations, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
