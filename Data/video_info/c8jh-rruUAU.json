Vectors have direction while scalars do not. You will be a physics expert in no time.\n\nMy name is Chris and my passion is to teach math. Learning should never be a struggle which is why I make all my videos as simple and fun as possible. I cover all subjects from basic level math through upper level calculus and statistics. I also make brain teaser and Rubik's cube videos for fun. \n\nFacebook - http://.facebook.com/MathMeeting\nYouTube Channel - http://YouTube.com/MathMeeting\nPatreon - http://Patreon.com/MathMeeting", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c8jh-rruUAU/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c8jh-rruUAU/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c8jh-rruUAU/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c8jh-rruUAU/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Math Meeting", "tags": ["Vectors and scalars", "vectors", "scalars", "physics", "calculus", "Mathematics (Field Of Study)", "math meeting"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Vectors and Scalars - Physics", "description": "Learn the difference between vectors and scalars in this simple tutorial.
