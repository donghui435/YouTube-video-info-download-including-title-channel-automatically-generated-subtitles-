So, don't worry about it. It is similar. We need to calculate the missing length. Turns out the missing length is right here, okay? \n\nSo, what you do first is you have to set up like a proportional fraction. So, let's put an equal sign right here. And put up a fraction sign and a fraction sign. So, what you do is this, you know that these two are similar triangles, okay? So, the shorter side with the shorter side, there's a ratio that's involved between these two so, my own little preference is I'm gonna take the bigger number that goes first. So, I'm gonna put a two right here, for the bigger triangle. This side right here versus this side, which is 0.5, okay? \n\nThen, I'm gonna try to figure out my missing x right here. So, this missing x corresponds to the six over here, okay? Because the hypotenuse and the hypotenuse of the two triangles would go together. So, the six over here of my bigger triangle will match the x here for my little triangle. So once again, the bigger on the top, smaller on the bottom. Just because the math is easier. The six is over here, and the x is over here, okay? \n\nNow, maybe now you're not go with the algebra. But you can just think about this. They are the same ratio to each other. All you need to do is think about how to go from two to six. Well, mathematically, going from two to six, you just have to times it by three. And since you times by three to the top, you have to do the same thing to the bottom, right? So, 0.5 times by 3, you get yourself a 1.5 at the very end. \n\nSo, x over here turns out just to be a 1.5 meters. And that is your final answer.
