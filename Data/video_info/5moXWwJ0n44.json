I will do all the pointing and drilling, and students can simply think the answers in their minds!\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://www.mathmammoth.com/lessons/multiplication_tables.php\n\nAnd check out my workbook on multiplication concept & the tables:\nhttp://www.mathmammoth.com/multiplication_1.php\n\nI use a \"structured drill\" method, which means the student sees the structure of the table while answering the multiplication questions. This helps the child to connect the logical structure of the table and the 'answers'. The drill does not become just a pure memorization effort, but it allows the child to use strategies for the facts, based on the CONCEPT of multiplication.\n\nFor example, the structured drill reminds students VISUALLY that 9 x 3 is just one step from 10 x 3, so the answer to 9 x 3 is three less than the answer to 10 x 3.\n\nThe 2nd part of this lesson is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc5oolLrfD8", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5moXWwJ0n44/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5moXWwJ0n44/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5moXWwJ0n44/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5moXWwJ0n44/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Math Mammoth", "tags": ["Multiplication", "Multiplication Table", "Skip Counting", "Math", "table of 3", "multiplication table of 3", "drill", "structured drill", "Third Grade (Grade Level)"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Multiplication table of 3 - skip-counting pattern and structured drill", "description": "Use this video to help children learn the multiplication table of 3 in three PARTS: (1) the skip-counting pattern - both \"up and down\"; (2) the table; and (3) the table backwards.\n\nStudents can just watch the video to learn the times table!
