Be sure to avoid the common student misconception where students think that the part to the right of the decimal point is some kind of \"number\" in itself. Such students could say that 9.114 is greater than 9.4, thinking that 114 is greater than 4.\n\nCheck out also my free books and worksheets at http://www.mathmammoth.com/free", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vhKBhhOMzE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vhKBhhOMzE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vhKBhhOMzE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vhKBhhOMzE/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}}, "channelTitle": "Math Mammoth", "tags": ["compare decimals", "comparing decimals", "3 decimal digits", "fractions to decimals", "decimals to fractions", "5th grade", "math"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Fractions to decimals, and comparing decimals - up to 3 decimal digits (thousandths)", "description": "First we practice writing fractions as decimals and vice versa (up to 3 decimal digits).
