I did not describe the method in the video, so let me describe it here:\r\n\r\nStart the list with a sequence of n 1s, i.e. 11 . . . 1. We will generate successive words until we reach kk . . . k. For any word A = a1a2 . . . an, the successor of A is obtained as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Let i be the largest value such that ai is less than k\r\n2. Let B = a1a2 . . . ai-1(ai + 1)\r\n3.

If i does not divide n, the successor of A appears earlier on the list under rotation. Generate a successor to the word before removing it from the list.\r\n2. If i divides n but not equal to n, the successor of A is periodic. Generate a successor to the word then replace BB . . . B with B. Replace 11 . . . 1 at the start of the list with 1.\r\n3. If i = n we keep the successor of A.\r\n\r\nThis creates a list of Lyndon words, of lengths that divide n, written in lexicographic order. \r\n\r\nTogether, this list creates a De Bruijn sequence of length k^n, containing all the combinations of length n (if the sequence wraps around) using the digits 1 to k.\r\n\r\n\r\nOk then, here's an extra one for you to try. Use the algorithm to give me a sequence containing all 6-digit combinations using the numbers 1 and 2.
