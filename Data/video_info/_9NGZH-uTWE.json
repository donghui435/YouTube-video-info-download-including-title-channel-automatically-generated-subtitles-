In this lesson, students learn that the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on a number line. For example, the absolute value of --8 is +8, because --8 is 8 units from zero on the number line. Note that the absolute value of any positive or negative integer is positive. Students also learn that the first step to simplifying absolute value problems is to simplify inside the absolute value, if possible.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_9NGZH-uTWE/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_9NGZH-uTWE/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_9NGZH-uTWE/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}}, "channelTitle": "MathHelp.com", "tags": ["absolute", "value", "number", "integer", "numbers", "integers", "how", "find", "add", "addition", "simplify", "values", "what", "is", "definition", "of"], "categoryId": "27", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "localized": {"title": "Absolute Value - MathHelp.com - Algebra Help", "description": "For a complete lesson on absolute value, go to http://www.MathHelp.com - 1000+ online math lessons featuring a personal math teacher inside every lesson!
