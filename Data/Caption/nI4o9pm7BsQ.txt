G'Day, I'm James from the Global Math Project.Last October a global phenomenon occurred.It was our inaugural Global Math Weekand it was amazing because over 1.7 million
students and teachersfrom about 170 different countries and territoriestook part in a shared common experience
over mathematics.Joyous, beautiful, human, meaningful,
relevant mathematics.It was the story of exploding dots.Teachers and students all across this planet
during that weektook their first encounter on this piece of mathematics
and talked about it togetherand shared that experience together
on social mediaand it became a global phenomenon.And do you know what?It's been growing ever since.For the last six months, it has gone from 1.7 million
students and teachers across our fabulous planetto about 4.6 million students.And by popular demand,
we're going to do it again this coming October.October 10th of this year
is our second Global Math Weekwith the story of exploding dots.It is so joyous, so uplifting, people want
exploding dots again and here they are.Let's see arithmetic
the way you've never seen it before.True, deep, meaningful understanding.Let's see how arithmetic is actually
a story of polynomial algebra in high school work.Don't stick with polynomials,
go to infinite work.Why not?Let's go to pre-calculus and so forth.Play with really weird numbers,
0.999 going on forever.How about nines going the other way as well.Mind blowing.Base one and a half.This is getting to weird territory.Let's go into some unsolved
research mathematics.Or go back to grade school arithmetic
and do fractions.Understand the story of place value
in the ways you've never seen beforeand push it to heights you've never been before.The wonders, the magic, the beauty,
the joy, the uplifting experienceof exploding dots is coming back again
this coming October.We try to reach 10 million students
and teachers across this planet.We can do it, be part of it.Take part in the joy.Go to our website
www.globalmathproject.org.Learn what exploding dot are.Everything's actually available right now.See what you're in for, enjoy it,
love it right now and then share itand have your students share it
come October 10th this coming year.Beautiful.So let's have a second global phenomenon.The story of mathematics.Curriculum, relevant, beautiful,
human, meaningful mathematics.Let's share it with the world.It's been such a moving experience for me
actually I have to say.Everything has been volunteer
and grassroots.This has really been done by the power
of our beautiful teachers all across the planetactually embracing the joy of mathematics
and sharing it with their students.Very touching,
it's actually wonderful.Let's do it again.Mathematics is fundamentally human.Mathematics is fundamentally joyful.Please, take part in the joy
this coming October.
