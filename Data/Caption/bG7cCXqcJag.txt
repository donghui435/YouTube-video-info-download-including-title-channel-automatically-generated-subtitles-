can you produce a rational number byexchanging infinitely many digits of piand e the discipline of math has awonderful sense of communitymathematicians love to share their ideasand questions with each other toproblem-solve together just like you alldo in the comment section of this showthere are several online forums wheremathematicians post questions andresponses recently on one of themmathematician Aaron Carmody asked if Iexchange infinitely many digits of kiand pi are the resulting numberstranscendental she received some curiousanswers ones which provide an awesomepreview into the way mathematiciansapproach research with intuitioncollaboration and a strong desire toexplore the unknown transcendentalnumbers are a very specific kind ofirrational numberand certainly the subject of some futureepisodes so we'll focus on irrationalnumbers in general which is what mostmathematicians in this post did PI and Ealso known as Euler's number are twofamous irrational numbers so we'll askcan you exchange infinitely many digitsof pi and e to get a rational number allthe real numbers any number that appearson the number line can be divided intotwo categories rational and irrationalrational numbers are those that can bewritten as n divided by n where N and Mare two integers like 73 over 5 or 1over 7 or 133 over 300 an equivalentdefinition is that rational numbers arethose whose decimal expansions terminateor eventually repeat like 14.6 or zeropoint one four to eight five sevenrepeating or zero point four four threethree three three three three threethree three even rational numbers thatwe think of as having terminatingdecimal expansionlike 14.6 actually have a repeating zeroif we write it as fourteen point sixzero zero zero zero zero zero zeroirrational numbers are all the realnumbers that aren't rational meaningthey're decimal expansions don't repeatsome well-known examples include pi esquare root of two and the golden ratioactually the proof that the square rootof two is irrational is a fantasticclassic you can try it for yourself orcheck out the link in the descriptionbefore we return to the originalquestion let's start with a warm-upquestion do there exist two irrationalnumbers such that we can exchangeinfinitely many digits of them and oneof the resulting numbers is rationalpause here if you want to think about itthe answer is yes maybe you came up witha different examplebut here's mine the number zero pointzero one zero one one zero one one oneis irrational it's made up of strings ofones of increasing links with zerobetween each string of ones since thestring of ones becomes longer and longerit never repeats therefore it'sirrational similarly the number zeropoint 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 and so on isirrational but if we exchange infinitelymany of their digits like this we gettwo rational numbers 0 & 1 night or wecould trade these digits of these twoirrational numbers in this case one ofthe resulting numbers is rational andone is irrational okay back to theoriginal question where carmody isasking about two very specific numbersif I exchange infinitely many digits ofpi and E are the resulting numbersirrationalhere's pie and here's e there's a lot ofdifferent ways we could exchangeinfinitely many digits we could exchangethe odd digits to get this pair or everyfourth digit to get this pair or thesecond eighth and ninth digits and allthe digits after the 16th digit to getthese with infinite time and patience wecould just write down a big endless listof all the possible pairs of numbersthat arise by switching infinitely manydigits of pi and E what kind of numbersappear on that list are there rationalnumbers are there irrational numbersmathematician Joel David Hamptons whosework we featured in the infinite chessepisode began his response to karma nicequestion with a question of his own howoften do the digits of pi and edifferent and then the first digit afterthe decimal place is different it's 1for pi and 7 for each the second digitis different is 4 for pi and one freebut the 12th digit is the same it's 9for both if we exchange the 12th digitit doesn't do anything same thing forthe 16th and 17th digits what if thedigits of pi at me were mostly the sameif there were only finitely many placesthey differed what would happen wellthen there would only be finitely manynew numbers produced by the digit swapsand these new numbers would only differfrom pi or e at finitely many placesthis means that all the numbers on thelist would be irrational why let's justlook at PI assume we change finitelymany digits of pi let's look at the lastdigit that we changed everything afterit is unchanged since pi is irrationalthese digits don't have a repeatingpattern so the modified version of pialso doesn't have afeeding pattern and is thereforeirrational notice that if PI and E areonly different at finitely many digitsthen pi minus E is rational okay so theanswer is pretty easy if PI and E happento only differ at finitely many digitsthe numbers on the list are allirrational but it seems more likely thatthe digits of E and time differ itinfinitely many places in this case wecan produce infinitely many new numbersby swapping their digits that is thelist would be infinitely long rememberback to the hierarchy of infinitiesepisode where we talked about differentsizes of infinitythere was a smallest infinity which iscalled countable and then there werebigger infinities anything bigger thancountable infinity is called uncountableinfinity wellif PI and E differ at infinitely manydigits then the list of numbers producedby all possible exchanges of infinitelymany digits of E and pie is uncountablylong which actually means it's not evenpossible to write it in a list so thisis now a metaphorical list I'll leave itas a challenge problem for you to showthat it's uncountable let us know yoursolutions in the comments here's whythat's important for us there are onlycountably many rational numbers thatmeans there are more numbers on the listthen there are rational numbers so onlycountably many pairs of numbers have arational number that means for most ofthe infinitely many pairs of numbers onthe list both numbers are irrationalso if PI and E differ infinitely oftenmost of the numbers on our list areirrational but are any of them rationalmathematician Thierry tau had an answersort of for that part there's aconjecture which is basically anunproven educated guess that both Z andPI are normal numbers a normal number isone where any digit or sequence ofdigitsis equally likely to occur so as we lookthrough pi the number three occurs justas often as four and the sequence 1 to 3occurs just as often as the sequence 8 88 in other words the digits of a normalnumber are balanced a crazy fact aboutnormal numbers is that we know almostevery number is normal but have very fewconcrete examples in particular no onehas proved PI and E are normal numberseven though it's believed to be the caseCal pointed out that if PI and E arenormal numbers as we suspect then it'simpossible to produce a rational numberby exchanging their digits if you wantthe technical argument I recommendreading the original post linked in thedescription but here's the intuition ifyou did produce a rational number byexchanging the digits of pi and e thatnumber would have a repeating part ofits decimal expansion like this butnormal numbers don't like to repeatthemselves and blending two of themtogether doesn't change that fact so onthe list of all possible numbersgenerated by exchanging infinitely manydigits of pi and e are their rationalnumbers probably not there's threethings I want to highlight about whythis question is so cool one it's aboutian pi/2 we just saw two very differentanswers one coming from set theory andone coming from number theory 3 and thisis my favorite part this post is a smalland accessible preview into the way mathresearch really happens it's a curiousquestion with different perspectives andno known correct answer we've reduced acomplicated problem to other complicatedproblems ones about whether PI and E arenormal numbers or whether their digitsdiffer infinitely oftenand we're playing with mathematicalintuition I recommend checking out theoriginal post in the description forsome of the subtle details that Iomitted and don't forget to answer thechallenge in the comments also if anyonecan prove that a and PI differinfinitely many digits that'd be a greatfact to know for certain see you nexttime on infinite series hello I justwanted to respond to some of thecomments about our episode on theWolverine problem and solving it usinggraph colouring so first let's get tosome important stuff my t-shirt a lot ofyou had a lot of opinions about my shirtit says let epsilon be less than zero sopeople usually use the variable epsilonto sum like a really small positivenumber it's most commonly used incalculus but also shows up as otherareas of math so let epsilon be lessthan zero is just kind of a goofy jokemay be fine alright on to more importantthingscircuity knows asked for the hands ofyour Nelson problem the colored regionsdon't have to be the same shape rightcorrect they can be any shape and infact if you place restrictions on thekind of shapes that the colored regionscan be or what color each of thoseregions can be it changes the problem itchanges the bound on the chromaticnumber and if you check out theWikipedia article for how big yourNelson problem it actually tells you alot of those results and they're prettycool so go check it up finally BrianWillett gave a great answer to ourchallenge question why is the lowerbound on the chromatic number of theplane for here's his answer you canembed the graph we showed in the planesuch that all edges have length 1centimeterany coloring of the plane must have acoat you must have a coloring numberbigger than the one of the grass so toshow that the number the chromaticnumber of the graph must be figures inthree we need to note that it takes atleast two colors to color the outerhexagon and then the center vertex mustbe a third color the three vertices ofthe central triangle must be threedifferent colors but they are alladjacent to the vertices of the hexagonof the same color so these can't be thesame three colors from before and so weneed at least four colors an example ofa for coloring is shown good job Ryanwe'll see you next week[Music]
