so in this video we're going to find thedeterminant of a 2 by 2 matrix so let'sstart with this 2 by 2 matrix a Igeneralized it and use letters insteadof numbers just so you can see theformula better and the formula is thedeterminant of this matrix a is equal toa times D minus B times C and notice howa times D is the red diagonal of thismatrix and B times C is the greendiagonal of the matrix so let's use thisformula that I just showed you to findthe determinant of this matrix B and thedeterminant of matrix B is equal to atimes D which is our red diagonal so ourred diagonal are the numbers 3 andnegative 6 I need to multiply these twonumbers together so that's what I'mgoing to do right now I'm going tomultiply 3 times negative 6 and we needto subtract B times C and B times C isour green diagonal our green diagonalare the number 7 and negative 4 we needto multiply these two numbers togetherso that's what I'm going to do right nowI'm going to multiply 7 times negative 4and now the only thing that we have leftto do is multiplication and subtractionso the determinant of our matrix B isequal to 3 times negative 6 which isjust negative 18 minus 7 times negative4 which is negative 28 so thedeterminant of matrix B is equal tonegative 18 minus negative 28 which isequal to negative 18 plus 28 which comesout to positive 10 and before I finishthis video I want to tell you what thedeterminant is actually used for thedeterminant is very useful in findingthe inverse of a matrix however if thedeterminant is equal to 0then the matrix has no inverse or youcan say that the matrix is notinvertible so since our matrix B has adeterminant of 10 10 is not equal to 0so our matrix B is invertible
