now that we know how to use fractions torepresent parts of a whole there's a fewdifferent things we can do with themfirst of all we can compare fractionscomparing fractions means checking tosee if one fraction is greater than lessthan or equal to another fraction that'spretty easy if we think of fractions asparts of objects and draw pictures tohelp us see what we have here's anexample which of these fractions isgreater 3/8 or 5/8 to answer thatquestion let's start by drawing tworectangles and divide them into eightequal parts since the rectangles aredivided into eight parts each of thoseparts is called 1/8 now let's shadethree parts of the first rectangle orthree-eighths and five parts of thesecond rectangle or five-eighthsour picture makes comparing thesefractions easily you can see that 5/8 isgreater than 3/8 because more of thatrectangle is shaded ok now let's try onethat's a little harder which of thesefractions is greater 3/4 or 4/5 welllet's start again with two rectanglesbut this time we need to divide them updifferently because the fractions we'recomparing have different bottom numbersthe first rectangle will be divided intofour equal parts and we'll shade threeof them to show 3/4 the second rectanglewill be divided into five equal partsand we'll shade four of them torepresent 4/5 now to compare all we haveto do is see which rectangle is shadedin the most and that tells us that 4/5is greater than three-fourths there thatwasn't so hard after all all right let'stry one more example let's compare thefractions 1/2 in 2/4 again we start bydrawing rectangles and dividing them upinto parts 2 on this one and 4 on thisonenext we shade the parts of the rectangleaccording to our top numbers one on thisone and two on this one nowall we have to do is compare it wellwhat do you know the same amount of eachrectangle is shaded that means these twofractions are equal it might seemstrange that two fractions can havetotally different numbers and stillrepresent the same amount but they canfractions like thatare called equivalent fractionsequivalent fractions have a differenttop and bottom numbers but are equal invalue we'll learn more about equivalentfractions later in this video but fornow let's find out what else we can dowith fractions another thing we can dowith fractions is add them together anytwo fractions can be added but for nowwe're only going to add fractions ifthey have the same bottom numbersbecause those fractions are much easierto add like these two fractions 1/4 the2/4 let's add them together again we canuse drawings to help us solve thisproblem looking at the rectangles forthese two fractions we can add themvisually just by rearranging the partsbecause all of the parts are fourths ouranswer will also be fourths we can justtake this 1/4 and over here and combineit with these 2/4 and tada 3/4 so 1/4plus 2/4 equals 3/4 let's try anotherone let's add 3/8 to 5/8 and we can useany shape we want so I'm going to use acircle this time so we have 3 out of 8here and five out of eight here justlike our last problem we can add theseby combining the parts so let's putthese three over here with these 5 wellwhat do you know that fills up all eightsections so 3/8 plus 5/8 equals 8/8 orone whole circle in those examples youmight have noticed the pattern thebottom number of our answer was alwaysthe same as the bottom numbers of thefractions we were adding and the topnumber of our answer was just the sum ofthe top numbers of those fractions wellthat's how it works that's the procedureor set of steps for adding fractionsthat have the same bottom numbers that'simportant because if you can rememberthat procedure then you won't need touse drawings to help you add fractionsand that's a really good thing becausewhat if you had add these two fractionstogether 1500s and ten hundredths itwould be way too much work to drawrectangles and divide them up into 100parts fortunately since we know theprocedure for adding fractions we can doit without the drawings first let'swrite out the problem now because we'readding fractions we know that the answerwill also be a fraction the bottomnumber of our answer will be the same asthe bottom number of the fractions wereadding 100 and thenumber of our answer will just be thesum of our top numbers 15 plus 10 whichequals 25 so as you can see addingfractions with the same bottom numbersis easy when you know the procedure allof this brings up a really importantwhen you're first learning aboutfractions drawing pictures and imaginingthat fractions represent parts ofcookies and candy bars can be reallyuseful and it can taste good to thinkingof them that way can help you understandhow simple fractions work and it caneven help you solve some basic mathproblems but soon you'll have to doharder math problems and to solve thoseyou'll need to stop thinking aboutfractions as just parts of things andstart thinking about them in a differentway and that's what we're going to betalking about in the next section beforewe move on let's review what we'vecovered so far we can draw pictures toshow how fractions represent parts of awhole using drawings we can comparefractions to see which one representsthe greatest amount if we compare twodifferent fractions and find that theyrepresent the same amount then we callthem equivalent fractions we can alsouse drawings to help us do simpleaddition by combining the parts by doingthis we learned that the procedure foradding fractions that have the samebottom number is to just add the topnumbers and keep the same bottom numberin our answer now to make sure youunderstand how to compare and addfractions visually be sure to do theexercises for this sectionlearn more at
