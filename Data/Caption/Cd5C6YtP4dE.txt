all right in this video I just want todo an example of finding the midpointbetween two points and the basic idea isif you want to find the midpoint betweenx1 y1 and some other point x2 y2 webasically add the x-coordinates together/ to add the y-coordinates togetherdivide by 2 so we get all the midpointis if we're going from point A to pointB the midpoint would just be that pointthat's exactly in between the two it'sequidistant from those two points alongthe straight line between a and B okayso lots of points that are equidistantfrom a B but we need again the one onthe straight line between them so okaydetermine the midpoint of the two pointstwo thirds comma 1/4 and 11 over 6 comma7 over 9 you know it wonderful numbers abunch of fractions Oh Patrick why areyou doing it to us so okay so basicallyit says to find the midpoint of the twopoints we have to take 2/3 we add tothat the other x coordinate which iseleven-sixths and then we divide all ofthat by 2 to get the midpoint in regardsto the Y coordinates again we just take1/4 here we'll add to that 7 over 9 andagain we divide all that by 2 okay sotechnically that's the midpointobviously we're going to want tosimplify this a little bit try to cleanit upall righty so so for the first one let'ssee we've got two thirdsI believe I can multiply the top andbottom of the 2/3 just by 2 to get mycommon denominator of a 6 so we wouldhave 4 over 6you make my let's rewrite this alltogether how about that so we would have4 over 6 plus 11 over 6 again all thatdivided by 2 comma so for our otherfraction to get common denominators Ithink for the first fraction we're justgonna have to multiply the top andbottom by 9 for the other fraction we'lljust have to multiply the top and bottomby 4 so let's see it looks like we wouldget 9 over 36 plus it looks like 28 over36 when we multiply again all that / -let's see so if we do the arithmetic 4 6+ 11 6 would be 15 over 6 again alldivided by 2let's see 9 + 28 that would be I believehow about 37 over 36 again all dividedby 2 so remember what we can do at thispoint is we can write 2 as a fraction 2over 1 and 2 over 1and remember to divide a fraction by afraction we leave the top fraction alonebut then we flip and multiply so we canmultiply by 1/2 if I flip and multiplyand then for the second one wife 37 over36 again times 1 over 2 may begin tomultiply we just multiply across the topand across the bottom typically I wouldtry to see if anything kind of cancelsout but I don't see anything that willcancel in my my my 15 over 6 times a 1/2likewise I don't see anything that'sgonna cancel out you know in the secondcoordinate so I'm just going to multiplythem out so the numerator so themidpoint we would get 15 on top 12 onthe bottom that would be ourx-coordinate and then we would have 37times 1 over 36 times 2 which is goingto be 72 and now we found the midpointof our V of the original two points
