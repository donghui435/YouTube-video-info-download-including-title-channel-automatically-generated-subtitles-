this lessons part one the fractions andit's bad equivalent fractions equivalentfractions in two fractions that althoughthey use different numbers actuallyrepresent the same thing and I'll showyou what I mean by this well we're gonnawould have first the fraction 1/2 whichlooks like thisit's like getting a pine cutting intotwo pieces well what about if what we dowith the pies were cut into four piecesas shown just here how many pieces doyou need to eat half this pie probablywhat did I answer to that looks likethis and what you'll probably notice isit a half one over two is exactly thesame as saying 2 over 4 so what youcould say is 1/2 2/4 the same thing sameamount different numbers what aboutmaybe we cut this point eight piecesokay how many bits we need to actuallyhave 1/2 it's 4 so 1/2 2/4 4 rightsthey're all exactly the same things soyou can see this pattern really wellusing the pictures which show thatyou're dealing with each time exactlythe same amount it's just differentnumbers so how do you convert betweenequivalent fractions without goingthrough the ordeal of drawing life everytime well today we're trying to get 1/2and we're trying to change it through anumber over 4 well we look at the bottomnumbers yeah what you'll notice is toget from toodles for what you have to dois you have to multiply by 2 so you dothe same to the top number 1 times 2 is2so you want to get from one half to anumber over eight without drawing itwell you look at a half the bottomnumber two to get to the bottom numbereight two times four is eightso one times four is fourthe similar thing happens if you want toconvert safe from to our four to anumber over to you it's calledsimplifying or you can look at four toget to two you actually have to divideby two so the top number 2 divided by 2is 1 and as you'll see a similar we meanwith a pause dividing by 4 what you dothe top you do the bottom so here's acouple of examples first one we'll lookat 3/5 you want to get it to become anumber is 15 so 5 to get to 15 you haveto multiply by 3 what you do the top youdo the bottom so we also have tomultiply the top number by 3 3 times 3is not pretty easy another example yousay something like 4/7 we wanted to getto be a number over 35 so we looked atthe bottom numbers to get from 7 to 35we have to multiply by 5 so we also haveto multiply by with the top layer topyou do to the bottom with 4 times 5 is20 so 4/7 is the same as 20 over 35pretty easy once again all you're doingis you're dealing with the same amountsand different numbers anyway that's allfor now bye
