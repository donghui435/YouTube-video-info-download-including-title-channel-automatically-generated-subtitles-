so now I want to go over some examplesof adding and subtracting fractions andthe main thing you have to remember andI wrote this for you in green is youmust have common denominators and thedenominator is just a bottom number in afraction so what that means is is thatthe bottom number in both fractions haveto be common or they have to be the sameso let's just get started with thisexample here we have 5 over 7 plus 1over 7 and notice how both of our bottomnumbers both of our denominators are thesameso they're common we have a commondenominator of 7 so since we have acommon denominator we can add thesefractions quite easily whenever you addfractions the denominator always staysthe same so we know that we're going tohave a denominator of 7 and then in thenumerator we just add the two numbers sosince we have a 5 and 1 we just add thetwo numbers together so in our numeratorwe have a 5 plus 1 which is equal to 6and our denominator we have a 7 so 5over 7 plus 1 over 7 is equal to 6 over7 so now let's see the same exactproblem with subtraction say we have 5over 7 and we subtract 1 over 7 insteadand once again we need to have commondenominators and we do we have a commondenominator of 7 so we can just subtractthese fractions quite easilyonce again our denominator stays thesame we have a denominator of 7 and thenin the numerator instead of adding 5 and1 we're going to subtract 5 minus 1 soin our numerator we have 5 minus 1 whichis 4 in the denominator we have a 7 soour final answer is 4 over 7 so here aresome more videos with some more exampleproblems related to the video you justwatchedI really hope you're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you lateryou
