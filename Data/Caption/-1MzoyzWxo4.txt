all right in this video I'm going to doa few examples related to parabolaswhich are one of the types of conicsections and a parabola of the form ifwe have y equals a times the quantity Xminus H squared plus K this is going tohave a vertex at the point positive H sothe sign in the middle even though wesee negative H we use positive age andthen we use the same sign as the K onthe outside so positive H positive Kit's going to open upwards and a isgreater than 0 and it's gonna opendownwards if a is less than 0 okay sonot both on the same graph you just getone or the other so a couple questionsso the graph of y equals negative 3times X plus 4 squared plus 5 this is aparabola with what vertex and in whatdirection does it open well again thevertex is not too bad when you have itin this form even though I see a plus 4we use a negative 4 but again whateverthe constant is that's being added orsubtracted we actually use that one sothe vertex in this case would benegative 4 comma 5 and the a value isthe number out front and in this casesince our a value is negative 3 which iscertainly less than 0 that's going tomean the parabola will open down wordsMesa no big dealjust recognizing a formula you know atype of a form of this form of aparabola another question here supposeyou've got the parabola 3x squared plus12x minus 1 we want to know a couplethings and what direction is theparabola open what's the vertex what'sthe y-intercept and how many real rootsare there well in what direction doesthe parabola open all you have to do islook at the coefficient on the x squaredterm that's going to be your a value soin this case since a is 3 which isgreater than 0 we would say that itopens upwards okay so it opens upwardswe want to figure out the vertex so thisis probably to me the the hardest partof any of these questions to figure outthe vertex what we're gonna do is forthis parabola 3 x squared plus 12x minus1 what I'm going to do is I'm going tocomplete the square okay on the righthand side okay so the first thing I'mgoing to do is I group my X's togetherI want the coefficient on the x squaredterm to be a positive one so whateverthe coefficient is I factor it out well3 times x squared would be 3 x squaredbut then we would also have to changeinstead of 12x we would now have to makeit 4 X so that gives me my positive 12xbut I'm gonna leave myself a little roomto because I'm going to do thiscompleting the square step okay a couplethings to be careful about so the firstthing we do is we take the coefficientin front of the X which is positive 4that's going to give us a positive 2 andthen what we do is we take that numberand we square it that's going to give usa positive 4 that's the number we putback inside the parentheses soat this point we've changed our equationaround okay if you were to distributeeverything out we had we would get ourthree x squared which we had originallyin the problem we would get a plustwelve X which we originally had in theproblem but notice if we multiply thisour coefficient of a three and thisvalue of a four we just got we would endup getting a positive twelve so reallywhat I've done is I've added twelve tothis equation on the right hand sidejust kind of out of nowhere and that'sokay but we have to compensate for thatand since we added twelve what we'regoing to do is we're going to subtract12 from both sides so again you know tome this is kind of the step that youknow a little less mechanical you reallyhave to think what's going on here justto make sure that you're getting allyour coefficients and your valuescorrectly so at this point though theidea is we can factor x squared plus 4xplus 4 as X plus 2 times X plus 2 but wecan simply write that as an X plus 2quantity squared negative 1 minus 12would be negative 13 and now we havethis in our vertex form okay notice oura is the same a we picked out before thevertex in this case the vertex would benegative 2 comma negative 13 so we'venow figured out the vertex by writing itin this vertex formPart C what's the y-intercept well toget the y-intercept all we have to doto get the y-intercept all we do issimply plug in x equals zero so if weplug in x equals zero in our originalequation we'll get three times zerosquared plus twelve times zero minus oneor we'll simply get a y-value ofnegative one so the y intercept is goingto equal negative one we could say it'sat the point zero comma negative one andthe last question here how many realroots are there so without finding thereal roots I'm just going to make ageometric observation we said the vertexwas at negative two comma negative 13 sonegative 2 comma negative 13 I don'tknow it's somewhere down there but wealso said that this parabola because ofthe coefficient on the x squared termbeing positive we said since it'spositive it's going to open upwards andsince it opens upwardswell that means in this case it's goingto have to cross the x-axis at twoplaces and since it crosses the x-axisat two places I would say well sincethat happens there has to be two realrootsokay crosses the x-axis twice that meansthere are two real roots one more quickproblem here suppose we want to find theequation of this parabola given that weknow that a equals two well all we haveto do we know our formula for a parabolais a times X minus H quantity squaredplus K well in this case my H value ispositive one because that's thex-coordinate of the vertexmy K value is negative one becausethat's the y-value of the vertex and atthat point we're given everything weneed we're told that a equals two sothen we would have x minus thex-coordinate of the vertex which is oneand then we use plus we could write plusnegative one but I'm just gonna writethat as well negative one so we've nowgot the equation of our parabola
