all right in this video we're going todo a little introduction to vectors andall vectors are there basically we justrepresent them with little arrows andall they represent are they representquantities that have both a magnitudeand a direction associated with themokay very very very very useful usefulthings so here we're going to talk aboutcomponents in magnitude so if a vectorstarts at the point x1 comma y1 and ifit terminates at x2 comma y2 then itscomponents to get the components we justsimply subtract the x-coordinates and wesubtract the y-coordinates the order isvery important you have to take thefinishing point minus the starting pointfor both the X and the y coordinates andwe put these in a little bracket or likea not even a bracket little arrow iswhen we write them the magnitude of ourvector V often times 2 when you writevectors you'll either make them bold orthey'll put a little line over them toindicate that they're a vector I mayaccidentally forget to put the littleline at times but hopefully the contextwill be clear when you put it in doublebars I've even seen it in just singlebars that's known as the magnitude orthe length of the vector so just acouple basic questions here we're goingto find the component form and themagnitude of each of these two vectorsso so my starting point for this one is2 comma 3 it terminates at 7 comma 6 sothis will be my X 1 and my Y 1 the 2 andthe 3 these will be my X 2 and my Y 2 soit says to get the component form wejust subtract x-coordinates you takethis the finishing minus the startingwe'll do the same thing with they-coordinate so we'll do 6 minus 3and if you calculate that we'll just getfive and three that'll be the componentform for the specter and when I kind ofthink about it it says well it kind ofmoves five to the to the right and thenthree okay it's kind of what it'stelling me in another way if you thinkabout it geometrically to get themagnitude so if we call this vector V toget the magnitude the magnitude again isjust the length of the vector so you cando two things you can just immediatelyuse the distance formula you know soremember the distance formula yousubtract the x-coordinates square themyou subtract the y-coordinates squarethem add them together in square rootequivalently in a sense we've alreadydone that by finding the vector formwe've already subtracted the xcoordinates and the Y coordinates so toget the magnitude we can simply takeeach component so and square it and thenwe'll square root it so I'm going totake five squared plus three squaredlet's see that's going to beso that's 25 and 9 25 and 9 would be 34you can factor the square root of 34 youcan factor 30 force 2 and 17 but youcan't take roots of either of thosenumbers nor can you really factor themany further so I would simply leave themagnitude here as the square root of 34okay so we've got our component form andour magnitude let's do the same thingfor this other example they can grabanother sheet of paper give ourselves alittle more room so if we do the samething so to find the component formwe'll take notice now it stops at thepoint at the bottom so it stops whereverthe arrow is pointing at so let's seenow we'll do 2 minus 3 and then we'll donegative 3 minus 1 well 2 minus 3 isnegative 1 negative 3 minus 1 isnegative 4 so that's going to be thecomponent form and maybe I'll label thatas a vector you well again to get themagnitude of this vectorwe simply square each component and addthem together and square root them againall we're doing is using a distanceformula so this will be 1 plus 16 itlooks like to me which will give ussimply the square root of 17again we can't really simplify that muchfurther so that would be my magnitudeand this would be the components for thevector
