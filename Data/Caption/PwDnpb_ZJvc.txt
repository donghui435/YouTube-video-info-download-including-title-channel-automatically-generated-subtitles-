So let's think a little
bit about powers of 0.So what do you think 0 to the
first power is going to be?And I encourage you
to pause this video.Well, let's just think about it.One definition of exponentiation
is that you start with a 1,and then, you multiply this
number times a 1 one time.So this is literally
going to be 1 times--let me do it in the right
color-- it's 1 times 0.You're multiplying
the 1 by 0 one time.1 times 0, well, that's
just going to be equal to 0.Now, what do you think 0
squared or 0 to the second poweris going to be equal to?Well, once again, one way
of thinking about thisis that you start
with a 1, and we'regoing to multiply
it by 0 two times.So times 0 times 0.Well, what's that going to be?Well, you multiply
anything times 0,once again, you
are going to get 0.And I think you
see a pattern here.If I take 0 to any
non-zero number--so to the power of
any non-zero, so thisis some non-zero number, then
this is going to be equal to 0.Now, this raises a very
interesting question.What happens at 0
to the 0-th power?So here, 0 to the millionth
power is going to be 0.0 to the trillionth
power is going to be 0.Even negative or
fractional exponents,which we haven't
talked about yet,as long as they're
non-zero, this is justgoing to be equal to
0, kind of makes sense.But now, let's think about
what 0 to the 0-th poweris, because this is actually
a fairly deep question.And I'll give you a hint.Well, actually, why
don't you pause the videoand think a little bit about
what 0 to the 0-th powershould be.Well, there's two
trains of thought here.You could say, look, 0 to
some non-zero number is 0.So why don't we just
extend this to all numbersand say 0 to any
number should be 0.And so maybe you should say
that 0 to the 0-th power is 0.But then, there was
another train of logicthat we've already learned,
that any non-zero number,if you take any non-zero
number, and you raise itto the 0-th power.We've already established
that you start with a 1,and you multiply it times
that non-zero number 0 times.So this is always
going to be equal to 1for non-zero numbers.So maybe say, hey, maybe
we should extend thisto all numbers, including 0.So maybe 0 to the 0-th
power should be 1.So we could make the argument
that 0 to the 0-th powershould be equal to 1.So you see a conundrum
here, and there's actuallyreally good cases, and you
can get actually fairlysophisticated with
your mathematics.And there's really good
cases for both of these,for 0 to 0-th being 0, and
0 to the 0-th power being 1.And so when mathematicians
get into this situation, wherethey say, well, there's
good cases for either.There's not a
completely natural one.Either of these
definitions wouldlead to difficulties
in mathematics.And so what mathematicians
have decided to do is,for the most part-- and you'll
find people who will disputethis; people will say, no, I
like one more than the other--but for the most part,
this is left undefined.0 to the 0-th is not defined
by at least just kindof more conventional
mathematics.In some use cases,
it might be definedto be one of these two things.So 0 to any non-zero number,
you're going to get 0.Any non-zero number to the 0-th
power, you're going to get 1.But 0 to the 0, that's a
little bit of a question mark.
