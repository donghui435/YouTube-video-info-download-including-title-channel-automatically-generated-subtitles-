all right we've left one questionhanging how to write all decimals asfractions now let me start off withsomething familiar like one-fourth thething to realize here that a fraction isreally an answer to a division problemthat this one here is really asked of1/4 and I can literally do that in a10-1 machine but let me do it now sohere's a 10-1 machine but clearly I'mgoing to go into decimals so let's dothis part of it here and I'm looking for1 1 . / spor what is for look like wellof sight dot dot dot dot okay so thequestion is can I finally grips to formthe picture I have up here that's whatdivision is announcer's well not rightnow but we know what to do in fact I canunexploded and have 10 dots appear hereso I'm going to get I'm getting tired ofdrawing dots right numbers of that'sokay why it's the question so I CD forthnow oh I see one could before I see himsecond good before that's two groups offour that eight of them and that leavestwo behind so I'll see two at that leveland there'll be two dots left behindgreat now those two dots there what canI do with them well I could unexplodedand they would make what twenty dotshere do I see any groups of four amongstthose twenty you bet I'll see five ofthem and I believe that leaves nonebehind so actually when I do conductsthis division problem 1/4 I see I getthe answer nothing point two fivenothing I think I think I think nothingso actually the answer is zero point twofive now most people don't botherwriting the extra zeros because there'sa whole bottle them simply many of themthey just stop at point two five or ifyou want to write a whole bunch of zerosfeel free or good in fact I'm going tochoose to write a bunch of zeros becauseI see those keep going zero zero zero anice repeating pattern alright becauseyou know I'm just hinting at somethingright now one fourth was nice becauseyou know some decimals do give yourepeating patterns the example theclassic one you might be think of rightnow is 1/3 1/3 that is 1/3 so I do thatone a 10-month seen let's see whathappens one dot then go and look at thethree or three look like or literallythree dots I don't see any right now soI'm going to do is I'm going tounexploded and have ten dots there can'tfind any threes in that pictureyou'd better find three groups of threewith one dot left behind so be threegroups of 3 1 dot left behindOh 1 dot here and explode but I findthese threes in there you better well Ifind three groups of three with one dotleft behind I'm exposed 10 dots therelife only groups of 3 you bet threegroups of three one left behind I seemto be in a loop and I'll be doing thisto ever so I'm not going to say that onethird is point three three three threeforever again another appearing decimalhappen so one quarter people say thefinite decimal or if you want say it isactually repeating pattern how aboutrepeating zeros eventually grand onefurther loss or repeating patternthere's sort of awkward fraction nextlets me work out the decimalrepresentation of 6/7 that's a reallyawkward number it takes a little whilewe don't do it but I need to clean theboard so I'll be right back all rightall right I'm back let's do the decimalexpansion of the fraction six seven thatis let's work out the division problem6/7 it's going to be awkward it can belong but that's actually do it I couldgo so let me draw like ten one machinesI need a lot of boxes methinks well Imean maybe that's enough who knows ahsix dots being there six dots divide byseven looking for groups of seven andpicture of six dots right now don't haveany but we know what to dowe'll unexploded explodes six times willmake sixty dots there now this questionbut I find any seven to mucks 60 you betI find eighth seventh among stat so Iguess I get eight groups of seven is 56leaving what's four dots behind allrightnow what happens let's see so our fourdots unexplored makes 40 tear any sevensamongst at seven times five isthirty-five five groups of seven leavingfive behind so far so goodfive dots left behind those v7z but abit unexplored I get 50 dots there 50got any groups of seven amongst at seventimes 7 49 yes so be seven groups ofseven they're leaving one behind okayI'm still goingNo seven said that's unexplored makes 10dots any sevens in there yep one groupof seven leaving what three behindI never here for a while okay threeunexplored makes thirtywith music Ross it out thirty fourgroups of 728 for groups of sevenleaving what to behind Oh golly geealright exploit exclude makes 2014that's two groups of seven leaving sixbehind six behind unexplored makes 60-56that's eight groups of seven leavingfour behind I feel like I'm doing thisagain in fact we start with six here Iwent through this chain chain chainchain chain and I went back to six againso I must be repeating what I just didwhich must come up be eight five sevenone four two and I must have anotherremainder of sixgive me back to eight five seven onefour two I'm in an infinite loop that'ssix seventh is going to be point eightfive seven one four two eight five sevenone four two eight five seven one fourtwo forever and some people like to usea horizontal bar to denote repeatingpatterns called a vinculum a very coolword that means that group of digitsgets repeated over and over again soeven six seventh is a repeating decimalokay so we have right now that onequarter is point two five zero zero zerozero forever so it repeats eventually aswe look up first one-third is 0.3forever point three three three threeand six seventh is repeating as well allthe fractions I pulled out so far have arepeating decimal expansion in fact ifyou play with more examples I bet you'llfind your examples to have a repeatingdecimal expansion eventually they mighthave a little hiccup first and thenforward a repeating pattern curious thatbegs and big question is it indeed truethat every fraction as a decimal is arepeating decimal might be repeatingzeros or might be repeating block likethis I wanted it always repeating sothat's the topic of the next lessonyou
