hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmom of calm in this video we are goingto study multiplying and dividingdecimals by ten hundred thousand and soo power by powers of 10 the shortcut orrule we are told has to do with thishundred times zero point two we are toldthat we have to move the decimal pointin this number how many steps how manyzeroes out here that's how many stepswe'll move it and so two zeros and twosteps the decimal point moves two stepslike this and so we need to put the zerohere and the answer is 20 anotherexample I have 10,000 times one pointzero four seven 10,000 has four zeros soI move my decimal point four steps for Ineed to put a zero there now to be ableto move here so the answer becomes oneten thousand four hundred seventy thissensor you can also figure it out bythinking that you have ten thousandtimes a number that is one something youknow little over one so ten thousandtimes one Shirley's ten thousand and tenthousand times a little over one is alittle over tripped up with the divisionthe rule is the same we move the decimalpoint but now the opposite direction0.59 divided by thousand is three zeroso we move the decimal point three stepsto this way nowokay but this whole point comes heresign it put zero and zero hereand the answer becomes zero point andthen zero zero zero five ninemy last example is one and 40 divided by10 to the sixth power this number hereis actually a million it has six zerosso we move the decimal point six stepsbut this number doesn't have a decimalpoint does it you have to think of itbeing here and then you move in sixsteps one two three four five six thatis one point comes here so we need toput zero zero zero one so zero point andthen zero zero one footnow some students or some students itmight be clear where this shortcut comesfrom but for some it might not be soclear so I wrote here what's the reasonbehind this shortcut all this roll whatis it based on and the answer is it isbased on place value and that's what weare going to look at in a little bit weare going to look at using place valuecharge to teach children aboutmultiplying and dividing decimals by tenhundred thousand and so this chart herehas a little box for each place valuefor each position in our place valuesystem the obeah means once his tenshundreds thousands and ten thousands andthis way we have tenths hundredthsthousandths ten thousandths and othertasks as we know our number system isbased on ten so that each position fromhere over there is ten times theprevious position for example when yougo from hundreds to tens tens is a tenthis ten times 100 or 10 is 10 times 100is 10 times 10 itself so I'm going towrite now here 1 and let's say we aremultiplying that by 10 so 1 times 10 is10everybody knows thatmeans that this one moves here to thetens column and then we need to writetheory if we have one and we multiply itby 100 then it will move here we put 0here so basically it's digital moved inthe place value chart 2 steps now nowlet's say we divide we have 1 divided by10 so 1 divided by 10 gives us a 10 itmoves here and a 10 equals zero is zeropoint 1 if you start with 1 and youdivide it by 100 then you get 100 andput 0 0.01 and so onif 1 is divided by 10 100 1000 orsomethingand it is like this digit 1 moves herethe place value chart as many steps asyou had zeros in your divisor or if youmultiply 10 moves this way and that isthe very basis of our place value systemand that is the very basis forunderstanding why we move the decimalpoint when we are dividing a multiplyingdecimals by 10 100 1000 so it's notreally that the decimal point moves it'sabout the digit or digits of the numbermove in this place value chart now if westart off with 2 and we divide 2 by 10for example you can think of it as 2being 1 and 1 and so the 1 divided by 10gives us 110 and the other one dividedby 10 gives us another 10 so in as wellresult we get 2 tenths so 2 divided by10 is 2/10 it is likely to move one stephere and similarly if we divide thesetwo tenths again by 10 it'll move hereand if we divided by 10 again it'll movehere and some so if we multiply the 2 by10moves here at 500 it moves here and sonow let's look at another morecomplicated example 2.76 divided bythousand I'm going to write this numberin my chart here 2.76 when it's dividedby thousand it is even think of it astwo divided by thousand and then seventytenths divided by thousand and sixhundredths divided by task each digitdivided by thousand separately so it islike each digit moves separately twodivided by thousand it will move threesteps here and then seven will movethree steps here and six will move threesteps herezerothe shortcut in school books says thatyou move the decimal point okay threesteps and it works but it's kind of likean illusion in reality the number movesin this place value chart but the neteffect is the same as if we had movedthe decimal point now if we have twopoint seven six and we multiply it by100 and then the two multiplied by 100will move here and say line will movetwo steps here and six will move twosteps here so I get 276
