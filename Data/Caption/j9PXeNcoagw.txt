a professor at the University of
Maryland asked thisawesomely evil test question you have
the opportunity to earn extra points forthis examselect whether you want two points or
six pointsbut there's a small catch if more than
10 percent in the class pick six pointsthen no one will get any points only I
will see your selection it will beanonymous to the rest of the classdo you pick two points or six points? when
this question wasposted to Twitter it went viral with a
lot of people discussing the questionit looks like there's a dilemma here and a
lot of people thought thatlook if we at least pick two points
everyone can cooperate then at least wecan get twobut that's not the game theory way to
think about this questionso let's try and to analyze what the
correct strategic decisionshould be given the incentives of this
questionyou want to think about your choicerelative to what the other people in the
class are doingand the relevant characteristic is how
many peopleare picking 6 it could be that more than
10 percent in the class is picking 6it could be the case that fewer than 10
percent in the class is picking sixor there's a small probability that
may be exactly 10 percent of the otherpeople are picking 6we'll construct a matrix based on what
the other people are doingto see what your payoff will be if more
than 10 percent in the classis picking 6 then it doesn't matter
whether you pick two or sixeveryone is going to get zero pointsnow, if fewer than 10 percent to the other
people are picking sixsay everyone else is picking two then
you are going to get the number pointsthat you pickif you pick two points you get two, if
you pick six points you get sixand now you can see something very
interesting you arealways better off at least as good of
picking 6as if you are picking two so picking six
hereis a logical choice whether the class is
more than 10 percent picking 6or less than 10 percentpicking 6 you are always going to score
more points if you pick 6versus 2 now there's onethird case to consider that may be
exactly 10 percent pick 6in this case you would get two if you
picked twobut you would ruin it for everyone and
get zeroif you pick 6 you would, you know, increase
the threshold beyond 10 percentso in this one small scenarioyou're actually better off picking two
points but is kindarare and there's no way you can know
that exactly 10 percent in the classis picking 6 so in a class of ten that
would beexactly one person picking 6 and
everyone elsepicking two this is a very unlikely
scenarioso you can kinda disregard this third
possibility and you could say picking 6is the logical thing to dobut there's another reason to think
about why picking six is logicalexams are not usually based on the
absolute number of points you getit's not usually a point threshold that
ninety percent is in a eighty percent is a Bthat's usually true in grade school or
high school but once you get to collegeeverything is usually graded on a curve
your gradeis based on how much better you do
relative to everyone elseso you don't want to think about the
absolute number of points you're gettingyou want to think about how many more
points you're getting than other peopleso when you think in this relativistic
methodif you get 2 and everyone else gets
2 your getting zero extra pointswhereas if you get six and other people
get 2then you have a chance to get four extra
points so we want to reduce the payoutswhen points are awarded by twoso if the class is getting more than 10
percent's picking 6 no one's gettingpoints anywayif you fewer than 10 percent are
picking 6then when you pick two if everyone gets two,you're not getting any more points than
anyone else who's picking 2but if you get six and other people are
getting two you get four extra pointsand then look at the third scenario where
exactly 10 percent is picking sixso say one in 10out of your ten percent class is picking
six andone person's picking six and every one else is picking twothen you're not going to do any better
than the people who are picking twoand if you pick six and spoil it for
everyone then youget zero so when you look at the payouts
nowpicking six is always at least as good
as picking twoso in this case picking 6 is the logical
choiceand it's what's known as a weakly
dominant strategy so when you have aweakly dominant strategy you're gonna
wanna play itnow the unfortunate outcome even though
everyone individually is thinking aboutpicking six and they all pick sixyou end in a situation that everyone ends up
with zero pointsbut this is not because any individual
person is thinking wrongthis game is sorta rigged so that the
group outcome sorta says oh you pick 6you're selfishbut that's not really the case I think
it should be your decision to pick sixand that's the logical thing to do
