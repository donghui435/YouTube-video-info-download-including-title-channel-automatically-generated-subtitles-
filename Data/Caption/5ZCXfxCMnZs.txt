so the first kind of sim we're going tolook at a little subheading for me is arandom sample okay now remind me remindme when you go from getting everyone'sdata to getting just a little part ofthe data in solving the problem ofpracticality and so you can actually getsome reasonable amount are we introduceda new problem what's the new problem weintroduced it's a word I haven't put onhere at all actually kind of wanna startso debate by it's very good right so wetalk about cognitive bias response biashere could to do the samples we callthis sample bias okay so simple biasesare a problem what kinds of samplebiases did we talk about yesterdayokay so if that particular subsection ofthe population you're talking to youalways like the same kinds ofcharacteristics like everyone whocatches a bus or everyone who is at homeat 10 a.m. on a Monday right if you'regetting the same critics over and overagainyou're not getting this is a reallyimportant phrase which I want to writedown to the separate color you're notgetting equal representation yourrepresentation of the target populationis not equal it's like skewed in someparticular directory you're only gettingthese kinds of people okayso a random sample is the whole idea isone of the greatest ways to get an equalrepresentation so here's the sentencethat this starts equal representationcan be achieved by selecting a samplerandomly hence the nameokay so I'm going to show you three waysto select a random sample for the firstone if you could open up your laptop forme or device or anything the idea iswe're trying to get equal representationin our sample right so what I want to dois instead of picking all the people inmy time a population or like this allthe people like that I just want to kindof pick some arbitrary set of them sothat's what we mean by random okay nowthe three ways I'm going to show you areall quite different to each other we'regoing to kind of go in order oftechnological fanciness but they allbegin and this is kind of getting yourclue they all begin with taking yourtime population and giving numbersrandomly assigning numbers to everyonein the population so for instance Icould give each of you a number from onetwo three four and I could then pick outlike say five of you on some randomnumbers okay so what each of thesemethods boils down to the first one isthe spreadsheet what each of these boilsdown to is I want a series of numbersfrom 1 to 24 and then maybe for instanceI'll just pick the first five okay sofirst I'll show you with the spreadsheetnow spreadsheets are great because eventhough you wouldn't have access to it tothem in any damn if you actually want todo this practical you have the realworld and there are lots of times butyou want to be able to not just when youwant to random sample spreadsheetsfiring away at the quickest way to do itso you can see I've just got aspreadsheet set up it's all nice andblank and what we're gonna do is we'vegiven take advantage of the fact thatthis is basically every one of thesecells okay it's like its own littleminiature calculator okayso I can get each one of those cellswhat just like I asked you to get yourcalculator out you will need it each oneof those is one of these separatelyokay so here's only going to do areyou're probably used to putting in stuffinto a spreadsheet like like words andnumbers of your own design but insteadof putting in your own data what I'mgoing to do is I'm gonna get thespreadsheet to calculate some R andnumbers for me okay so the first thingyou need to do in whatever kind ofspreadsheet you have open this is aGoogle spreadsheet just hit the buttonequals okay now what that indicates tothe spreadsheet is hey I want you tocalculate something I don't just wantyou to store a word or a number Iactually want you to work something outokay now what we know what is a randomnumber and it was this class what Iwould want is a random number between 1and 24 so sorry oh yeah okay all rightso you can give me a rounded on one butI want this to give you a round nose Ididn't trust you or me to career and Iwas actually humans are famously bad atcareer with random numbers so here'swhat I'm going to type and I'd like youto type this just like I am nowyou might not be able to see that I'mgoing to write on the board because youmay want to have this for yourself laterI put it in equals and then the type didan unusual word now just by seeing ityou can probably guess what it meansit's going to give me a random numberbetween any values on like Ryan I get tochoose the values so you can see I'mdepending on what you're using if you'reusing Excel if you type that like alittle menu comes up that says hey Irecognized what you're talking aboutright on mine you can see it's like it'scome up in this funny text so it sayshey yeah this is something that I knowwhat you're talking about so what it'sgoing to expect is if you open a bracketon over to bracket a space right therejust just a bracket okay now it mightyou might have like AutoCAD or somethinglike that which is fine up your screenoops have something similar to this whatthis says is up the bracket you canwrite this down your book if you likecome on high and then it ends the recordso the idea is our calculator is goingto take a number a low number and a highnumber and you'll spit out some randomnumber between those two now what do wewant we wanted one two three four yeahso I'm gonna type in 1 comma 24 and thenI'm gonna close the bracket okso again if you've done it right Excelor whatever you're using to do yourspreadsheet should do some like funnycoloring in there to say hey yeah cool Ireckon you guys eat what you've done andnow if you heat intolerant and it shouldhit you back a random number okaybetween 124 okay so you want to type inequals ran between open bracket 1 comma24 no spaces that's rightokay so we're picking numbers here rightnow here's where it gets really usefulfor us right I've got one random numberno big dealsuppose I wanted to pick 5 of you atrandom so just like everything else youcan on a computer you can copy that andyou can paste it however many timeswhoops did I miss that you like okay soyou can see it's going to keep oncontinually giving you random numbersand if you're on um if you're on excelyou can um you know you can typesomething and say like a text and thenevery time you change your spreadsheetit will hand you back a new set ofrandom numbers obviously I have a lotmore here than I need I only want fiveso I could say 23 7 12 5 20 for thosepeople who have those numbers you're nowmy random sample does that make sense okso this is just a quick efficient way ofdoing it it's very very good ok so youcan use that clearly if you wanted youcould change this like these low or highnumbers to anything you want but it's avery flexible and then quickly
