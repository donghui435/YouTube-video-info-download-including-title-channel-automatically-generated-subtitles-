everybody welcome to my video onabsolute value so what exactly isabsolute value and the formal definitionis the distance that any number is fromzero but in my opinion there is a mucheasier way to think about it which isthe absolute value is always positive sowhenever you are doing absolute valuecalculations that's something to thinkabout just know that the absolute valueis always going to be positive so let meshow you what I mean by this and let'sget started with some examples so let'ssay we have the absolute value ofnegative 3 and if you haven't figured itoutabsolute value is written with thebrackets around the number so here wehave the the absolute value of negative3 and we know that the absolute value isalways going to be positive so theabsolute value of negative 3 is going tobe positive 3 let's go over a bunch ofexamples let's say we have the absolutevalue of positive 3 once again we knowthe absolute value is always going to bepositive so the absolute value ofpositive 3 stays positive 3 let's goover another example let's say we havethe absolute value of 3 minus 5 and youcan think of absolute value asparentheses so let's simplify the insideof the parentheses first so inside ofthe absolute value we have 3 minus 5which is equal to negative 2 so we havethe absolute value of negative 2 onceagain we know the absolute value isalways positive so the absolute value ofnegative 2 is going to be positive 2let's say we have the absolute value of5 minus 3 once again let's simplify theinside of the absolute value first so onthe inside we have 5 minus 3 so we have5 minus 3 is equal to 2 so we have theabsolute value of positive 2 once againabsolute value always stays positive sothe absolute value of positive 2 stayspositive 2our solution so now let's go over someexamples that are a little bit harder solet's say we have the absolute value ofnegative 3 minus the absolute value ofnegative 5 so let's start all the way tothe left first we have the absolutevalue of negative 3 we know the absolutevalue has to be positive so the absolutevalue of negative 3 is going to bepositive 3 and now we have a negativesign that is outside the absolute valuesymbols so that just stays the same andnow we have the absolute value ofnegative 5once again the absolute value is alwaysgoing to be positive so the absolutevalue of negative 5 is going to be 5 sowe have 3 minus 5 3 minus 5 is equal tonegative 2 this is our solution let'ssay we had the absolute value ofnegative 3 plus the absolute value ofnegative 5 once again let's start withthe negative 3 we know that the absolutevalue is always going to be positive sothat is going to be a positive 3 ourpositive sign is outside of the absolutevalue so it just stays the same and youhave the absolute value of negative 5which is just 5 so we have 3 plus 5which is equal to 8 so now let's go overan even harder example let's say we have3 multiplied by the absolute value of 7minus 9 and this is being subtracted bythe absolute value of 3 minus 6 squaredand like I said before absolute valuebrackets can be thought of asparentheses so let's simplify the insideof the parentheses first here we have a7 minus 9 which is equal to negative 2so we have 3 times the absolute value ofnegative 2 our subtraction symbol isoutside of the parentheses so that juststays the same and here we have 3 minus6 inside of the brackets 3six is equal to negative three so wehave the absolute value of negativethree squared so once again we know theabsolute value is always going to bepositive so the absolute value ofnegative two is equal to positive twoour subtraction stays the sameand the absolute value of negative threewe know is going to be positive threeand we still have to put our squared ontop so simplifying even further we havethree times two which is equal to sixminus three squared which is 3 times 3 3times 3 is equal to 9 6 minus 9 is equalto negative 3 this is our solution sothese examples should give you a goodidea on how to simplify absolute valueexpressions in my next video I want totalk about solving absolute valueequations like this one the absolutevalue of X plus 3 is equal to 9 I'mgoing to teach you how to solve thisabsolute value equation for x so staytuned for that video I really hope thatyou are enjoying these and I will seeyou in my next one
