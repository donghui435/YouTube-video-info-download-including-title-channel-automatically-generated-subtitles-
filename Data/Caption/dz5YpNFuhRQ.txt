all right in this video we're going totalk about finding coterminal angles andall coterminal angles the way I kind ofthink about them a very not technicaldefinition to me coterminal angles orangles that are going to put you at sameplace so that's my very informaldefinition so what do we mean by thiswell again let's just uh let's take aquick little example here so here's Xhere's Y suppose we find the angle say45 degrees that's going to be kind ofhalfway through a first quadrant here sothis is 45 degrees there are many anglesthat would put us at the exact same spotso remember the distance around this ifwe go all the way around we've gone 360degrees so notice in this case I couldkeep going suppose I go all the wayaround once that would be 360 degreeswell if I go back to the same place if Itake 360 and add to that my 45 degreeswell in that case we'll get a 405degrees so 45 degrees and 405 degrees wewould say those are coterminal anglesbecause you basically end up you knowsort of in the equivalent the same spotlikewise we could add another 360 if weadd another 360 we're going to get 765degrees 45 degrees 405 degrees 765degrees those are all coterminal wecould have actually gone you know theydon't have to be positive angles eitherwe could have went went clockwise andthen we would have had a negative angleso if we go sort of the oppositedirectionlet's see if we take so if we went allthe way around sort of backwards thatwould be negative 360 degrees but thenwe would have to subtract 45 degrees soif we take 45 and subtract 360 degreesthat's going to give us negative 315degrees that would be another anglethat's coterminal with 45 degrees allfour of these angles are coterminal theyall basically again will put you at thissame the same spot so this is the basicidea to find coterminal angles so theybasically one way to find them is tojust simply look at their difference andsee if they're a multiple of 360 okay sothat's kind of the the main idea so takethe differenceand ask yourself is that number amultiple you know positive or negativeof 360 degrees okay so that's the mainidea here that's how we're actuallygoing to start checking and trying todetermine if two angles are in factcoterminal all right so let's take a fewexamples here so suppose we want to knowin our first case which were thefollowing angles is coterminal with theangle of 135 degrees it doesn't reallymatter the order in which you subtractthem so maybe let's check a hundred andeighty-five degrees first I'm going totake the bigger angle which is 185 andsubtract away the smaller one the onewe're trying to determine the one we'reworking with are 135 degrees so 185minus 135that's going to give me 50 degrees and Ithink well is 50 degrees a multiple of360 and definitely it's not so those arecertainly not going to be coterminal andagain you can kind of see that I made aquick little sketch here here's ahundred and thirty-five degrees 185would be somewhere you know a little bitfurther down so definitely those don'tput you in the same spot at all so it'skind of easy to see here with a littlediagram these are definitely notcoterminalbut same idea so let's see we can check495 whoops 495 - 135well 495 - 135 that actually gives usthree hundred and sixty degrees and wellcertainly that's a multiple of 360 so495 490 five degrees is definitely goingto be coterminal with the anglemeasuring 135 degrees let's check ourour negative 30 degrees next so let'ssee if we take negative 30 degrees andsubtract away a hundred and thirty fivedegrees in this case we're simply goingto get negative 165 degrees and againthat's not a multiple of 360 so 30degrees negative 30 degrees is notcoterminal 185 degrees is not coterminalthe only coterminal angle of the three Ihad listed is 495 again there'sinfinitely many angles that arecoterminal with 135 degrees but that'sthe only one we have listed here let'sdo one moresuppose we have negative 255 degrees andwe want to figure out of 105 degrees 45degrees and 90 degrees which one ofthese is coterminal well again let's seeso let's we can check 105 so if we take105 degrees and subtract away negative255 degrees well since we're subtractinga negative that's going to make apositive 105 degrees plus 255 degreesthat's going to give us 360 degreesagain certainly that's a multiple of 360so 105 degrees is going to be an anglethat's coterminal with negative 255let's check 45 degrees so if we do 45degrees- r- - 55 again that's just going tomake it positive just like in the lastexamplewell 45 degrees plus 255 degrees isgoing to give us 300 degrees well againthat's not a multiple of 360 so 45degrees is not coterminal likewise if wecheck our 90 degrees 90 degrees- negative 255 degrees that's going togive us three hundred and forty-fivedegrees and again that's simply not amultiple of 360 so 90 degrees is alsonot coterminal with the angle negative255 degrees so again this is basicallyall you're doing mechanically you justsubtract them see if it's a multiple of360 but again intuitively all you'rereally trying to do is just figure outyou know sort of what angles put you youknow sort of in the same direction atthe same spot
