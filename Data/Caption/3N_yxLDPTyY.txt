now cones and pyramids they have asimilar shape and they have a similarformula for finding the surface area sowhenever possible I like to groupformulas together just to make it easierto memorize and I think you'll find thateasier too so let's look at the formulathe surface area of course is the outersurface of the object all surfaces andyou can see it's the area of the base sothe capital B means the area of thebottom the base so in this case it'sgoing to be a square for this pyramidalthough it could be a triangularpyramid or any type of pyramid but it'dbe the area of the base here in thiscone it's going to be a circle so you'regonna find the area of the base usingthose formulas for that particular shapeand then you're gonna do one half theperimeter of the base times L which isthe slant height now the slant heightslike the like the leaning height likethis angle height we don't want theoverall height we use that when wecalculate the volume we're using theleaning or slant height so it's this onehere or this one here okay now in thepyramid you don't want to use this edgethis is called the lateral edge okay wewant actually the height of the triangleso that would be this height right hereso what I've done with the pyramid inthis first example is I've I basicallypeeled it like a banana right so peeledit back okay and laid it flat they callthat a net and what you have is you'vegot a square here on the bottom and fourtriangles okay so if you wanted to youcould just find the area of the squareand the area of one of these trianglesmultiply that by four add everythingtogether and you got it but what theformula does is it doesn't a little bitmore efficient way for you so I'll showyou how that works so the area of thebase here let's write down the formulait's going to be B plus 1/2 PL the baseis a square so 6 times 6 is 36 plus 1/2now the perimeter of the base that's thedistance all the way around that's goingto be 6 times 4 you can see that thereso it's 24 and then the slant height theleaning height in this case is 5 ok likethe leaning the Leaning Tower of Pisaright ok so this is 1/2 times 24 is 12times 5 is 60 plus 36 is 96 unitssquared ok because it's area where it'stwo-dimensional we're just covering itup with a little one-by-onesquares okay now for the cylinder itsI'm sorry for the cone it's a little bitdifferent because you can go ahead anddraw the circular base but it's a littlebit tricky to you know draw the sidesokay there's a lateral area if you tryto unfold it it doesn't fold flat likethe pyramid I just kind of you knowguess that what that would look likeit's hard to really you know unfold thisokay so it's still the same formulathough it's the area of the base plus1/2 PL now let's break this down so thebase is a circle so what's the formulaof the area of a circle it's PI Rsquared right so it's going to be pitimes 5 squared K cos the radius is 5plus 1/2 the perimeter of the base sothe perimeter of the base is justanother way of saying the circumferenceand what's the formula for circumferencewell it's 2 pi R or you could say pitimes diameter and you'll notice thatthe 1/2 and the 2 they cancel each otherout because half of 2 is 1 and so whatwe're left with here is pi times R timesL so in some books you'll see 4 cones PIR square plus PI RL okay but I've justwritten it this way so you have lessformulas to memorize ok area the baseplus 1/2 PL and so now we've got PItimes the radius which is 5 and theslant height this angled height which is13 okay so if we simplify this we get 5squared is 25 times pi plus 5 times 13which is 65 pi if we add those togetherwe get 90 PI units square
