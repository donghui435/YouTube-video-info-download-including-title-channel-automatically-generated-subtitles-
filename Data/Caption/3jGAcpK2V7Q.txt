all right in this video I'm gonna talkabout finding the greatest common factoror as it's usually abbreviated oroftentimes the GCF so in all theproblems I'm gonna do here I'm gonnafind the GCF the greatest common factorand the basic idea that you need toremember is we'll make some more senseout of this you're basically pulling outthe smallest exponents on any commonfactor along with that factor as well soif you've looked at the least commonmultiple video that I've made it'sbasically very similar idea but just alittle a little different so in thiscase we want to find the greatest commonfactor of 12 30 and 42 so you know ifyour arithmetic is pretty good you canprobably you know figure it out prettyquickly but what I'm gonna do is is justkind of do it the long way because thislong way I'm gonna do it works on morecomplicated expressions as wellokay so we're kind of looking for ageneral procedure we'll start off easywhat you want to do is you need tofactor each number so notice I'm gonnabreak down 12 I can write that actuallyas 4 times 3 I can break 30 down as 3times 10 I can break 42 down as 6 times7 well now I can actually break downsome of those even further I can rewrite4 as 2 times 2 so forget about my nextexample there well 4 2 times 2 I canwrite that as 2 squared you can't reallydo anything else with a 3/3 you kind ofhave to leave alone well 10 I can writethat as 2 times 5 and I'm just gonnaorder everything so I've got my 2 here'smy original 3 times 5 notice if Imultiply that out I get my 30 back welllikewise with 6 I can write that as 2times 3 times 7 okay so now what I do tofind the greatest common factorI start I basically just look at thevery first thing and I say okay wellI've got a two in this first part arethere twos and the other ones as wellwell yes there is a two on the firstpart the exponent is a to the secondpower the exponent on the other twos arejust ones so you have to take the factorand pull out the smallest exponent sowe'll pull out a 2 to the first then Ilook at the next number I say well okaythere's a 3 in there well and now Ithink are there threes and all the otherones as well well there's a 3 in thesecond part there's a 3 in the thirdpart you didn't excuse me they're all tothe same exponent of 3 so that means Ican pull out a 3 to the first and thenwe're done I mean you notice there's a 5& a 7 left over but there's no 5 or 7 inthe first part so this is your greatestcommon factor 2 to the 1st times 3 tothe 1st which equivalently is 6 and ifyou think about it 6 is the biggestnumber that goes into 12 30 and 42 okayso what if we have a bigger number okaywell maybe your arithmetic gets a littlehard you know the arithmetic is a littleharder here so I'm gonna do the samething I'm gonna start factoring thiswell I noticed 124 is even so you canwrite that as 2 times 62 212 is alsoeven so I can at least write that as 2times 106 so here's my original 2 fromthe first part I can break down 62 againthat's 2 times 31 here's my original twoI can break down 106 as 2 times 53and at this point you can stop 31 itturns out is actually a prime number soyou can't break 31 down any further evenif 53 could be broken down further itreally is irrelevant because however yousplit it up you're not going to get anynew factors that are in common so Icould write this as 2 squared times 31 Ihave 2 squared times 53 again I do thesame thing to find my greatest commonfactor I think well there's a 2 incommon there's also a 2 here I pull outthe smaller exponent but well they'reboth to a power of 2so I can pull out a 2 squared and then31 doesn't factor down any furtherso you're basically done at this pointit says the greatest common factor of124 and 212 is just simply the number 4so these are both pretty big numbers itfeels like intuitively there should besomething bigger that goes into them butit turns out that 4 is the greatestcommon factor so let me step through anddo a couple others here so in this casenow we've got some variables but theidea is exactly the same ok so in thispart I look at my first I've got X cubedY squared Z to the fourth that's oneterm I've got X to the fourth is esquared that's another and then Y cubedx to the fifth so I basically just lookat my very first one I say okay there'san X in there and hey there's an X inthe second one and there's also an X andthe third one well the X on the firstone is a power of three the second one'sa power of 4 and a power of 5 that meansI have to keep the smallest power so I'mgoing to pull outand X to the third power and then I goto my next part I see a Y in here butthere's no y in the second term so thatmeans you cannot there's no there's nowhy's that you pull out to include inthe greatest common factor and if younotice the same thing with the Z's wellthere's a Z and the first one there's aZ in the second one but there's no Z'sthan the last one so it turns out forthose original three expressions X cubedis going to be your greatest commonfactor okay so hey well now there'snumbers thrown in there as well that'sokay I'm going to factor eight you canactually factor 8 as 2 times 2 times 2or 2 cubed and then I'm going to leavemy x squared Y to the 3rd alone you canrewrite 12 as 4 times 3 but that's 2squared times 3 and I have X to the 3rdY to the fifth still hanging out thereand I'm gonna do the same thing with 36you can write that as 9 times 4 well 4is 2 squared 9 is 3 squared and then Istill have X to the first Y to thefourth okay so if you weren't you knowif you're not able to jump to thisfactorization certainly you know writethem down I'm just trying to save us alittle bit of time here so I can do acouple more examples okay I look at myfirst one I see that there's a 2 inthere there's a 2 in the second onethere's a 2 in the last one again youhave to pull out the smallest power butnotice the smallest powers on the twoare twos so that means my greatestcommon factor is going to involve a twosquared then I look at my next one wellthere's an X and then the first onethere's an X in the second one there'san X in the third one I look at thepowers I've got a 2 a 3 and a 1 so Ihave to pull out the smallest poweragain so I'm gonna pull out an X to thefirstand then again same idea I look at mywhy's okay there's a why in the firstone a why and the second one a why andthe third one I look at the powersthere's a power three a power of fiveand a power of four so that means I haveto pull out that smallest power which isa three so I'm gonna also have a Y tothe third so the greatest common factorhere is four times X times y to thethird see if we can't do another couplehere real quickso same idea okay now you have things inparenthesis but it's the same ideayou've got an X plus two to the third +X to the fourth a 2 X minus 1 to the 7thand then you have X plus 2 squared + 2 Xminus 1 to the 4th you just play thesame game so I see an X plus 2 in thefirst part I see an X plus 2 in thesecond part I look at the smallestexponent which is to the third power somy greatest common factor is gonnainvolve an X plus 2 to the 3rd power andnow I see an X raised to a power butnotice in the second part there's nosimply X's raised to powers so thatmeans you can't pull out any X's I lookat my next part I see a 2 X minus 1 ohthere's a 2 X minus 1 and the other oneas wellI see a power of 7 I see a power 4 againwe've got to pull out the smallest powerso you'll have pull out 2x minus 1 tothe 4th and again that'll be yourgreatest common factor let's do one morehere so x squared minus 4 and x squaredplus 5x plus 6 so on these problems thebasic idea is and all the other examplesis they were already factored well youcan factor x squared minus 4 as X plus 2times X minus 2 you can factor x squaredplus 5x plus 6X plus 2 X plus 3 and now I'm back to myexample like before I see there's an Xplus 2 in both of them that means youcan factor out an X plus 2 and then Isee there's an X minus 2 but no X minus2's in the other so that's gonna be yourgreatest common factor simply an X plus2 all right I hope these basic exampleshelp I hope I didn't step through thelast ones too quickly feel free to takea look at my website if you need to seesome least common multiple stuff or ifyou want to see some more examples ofthese just let me know I'll be happy totry to get to them
