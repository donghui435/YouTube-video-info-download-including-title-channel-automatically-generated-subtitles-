Identify the hypothesis and
conclusion of the followingstatement, and determine whether
the statement isalways, sometimes,
or never true.And the statement here is, the
absolute value of x is greaterthan 0 for all real numbers x.Now if I want to decide what the
hypothesis and conclusionis here, it's usually a lot
easier to figure them out ifyou rewrite this statement, this
exact statement, as anif/then statement.So what this statement is saying
is, if x is a realnumber, then the absolute value
of x is greater than 0.So let me rewrite that.If x is a real number, then
the absolute value of x isgreater than 0.These are equivalent
statements.Now when you write it like
this, it's much easier toidentify the hypothesis
and the conclusion.The hypothesis you can view as
it's the if part of thisproposition.So this right here is
the hypothesis.x is a real number.That is the hypothesis.And the conclusion
is the then part.Sometimes it's called
the consequent.It's this part right here.It's this part, x.Absolute value of x
is greater than 0.This is the conclusion
or the consequent.And over here, if you wanted
to circle them, this is theconclusion.That is the conclusion.And the hypothesis is for
all real numbers.It's a little bit easier to
identify when you see itwritten like this.This is the hypothesis.Now I don't want you to get
confused with the idea of ascientific hypothesis,
which is related buta little bit different.A scientific hypothesis is an
explanation for some phenomenathat can be tested.So a scientific hypothesis
might be something likesaying, blueberries-- which
I'm writing in blueintentionally.Blueberries help reduce
the risk of cancer.This right here is a scientific
hypothesis.You could then go feed a bunch
of people blueberries for along period of time and see if
they have a less likelihood ofdeveloping cancer than people
who never got blueberries andeverything else is equal.And so it would be testable.You could see if it's true.And the conclusion would be
whether this is true or not.But this is in the scientific
hypothesis world, not to beconfused with the notion
of hypothesis thatwe're using right now.And I don't want to confuse
you too much, so I'm justgoing to leave this
on the side here.But when you're in Algebra I
and especially-- these areaccording to the California
standards.The hypothesis in this context
is the antecedent of thisproposition.Or it's the if part of
this proposition.Now, the more interesting
question iswhether it is true.I mean, we can sit and label
statements all day, but that'snot interesting.The more fundamental thing is,
is this a true statement?Is it true that if x is a real
number, then the absolutevalue of x is greater than 0?Well the one number that pops
out of my mind that disprovesthis is if x is 0.0 is a real number.That's true.But-- and I'll write
but in caps.BUT the absolute value
of 0 is equal to 0.It's not greater than 0.So this disproves
this statement.It's definitely not
always true.Now, if you pretty much have
any other real number, thiswill be true.Because any other real number is
some distance away from 0.That's what the absolute
value measures.So if you took a 1 or a negative
1 or whatever, theabsolute value of those
are greater than 0.So this is sometimes true.
