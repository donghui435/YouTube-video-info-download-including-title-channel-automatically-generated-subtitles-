You already know that we can viewmultiplication as repeated addition.So, if we had 2 times 3 (2 ℅ 3), we could literallyview this as 3 2's being added together.So it could be 2 + 2 + 2.Notice this is [COUNTING: 1, 2] 3 2's.And when you add those 2's together, you get 6.What we're going to introduce you toin this video is the idea of repeated multiplication 每a new operation that really can beviewed as repeated multiplication.And that's the operation of taking an 'exponent.'And it sounds very fancy.But we'll see with a few examplesthat it's not too bad.So now, let's take the idea of2 to the 3rd power (2^3) 每which is how we would say this.(So let me write this downin the appropriate colors.)So 2 to the 3rd power. (2^3.)So you might be tempted to say,"Hey, maybe this is 2 ℅ 3, which would be 6."But remember, I just saidthis is repeated multiplication.So if I have 2 to the 3rd power, (2^3),this literally means multiplying 3 2's together.So this would be equal to,not 2 + 2 + 2, but 2 ℅ ...(And I＊ll use a little dot to signify multiplication.)... 2 ℅ 2 ℅ 2.Well, what's 2 ℅ 2 ℅ 2?Well that is equal to 8.(2 ℅ 2 ℅ 2 = 8.)So 2 to the 3rd power is equal to 8. (2^3 = 8.)Let's try a few more examples here.What is 3 to the 2nd power (3^2)going to be equal to?And I'll let you think about that for a second.I encourage you to pause the video.So let's think it through.This literally means multiplying 2 3's.So let's multiply 3 每(Let me do that in yellow.)Let's multiply 3 ℅ 3.So this is going to be equal to 9.Let＊s do a few more examples.What is, say, 5 to the 每 let's say 每5 to the 4th power (5^4)?And what you'll see here isthis number is going to getlarge very, very, very fast.So 5 to the 4th power (5^4) is going to beequal to multiplying 4 5's together.So 5^4 = 5 ℅ 5 ℅ 5 ℅ 5.Notice, we have [COUNTING: 1, 2, 3] 4 5's.And we are multiplying them.We are not adding them.This is not 5 ℅ 4.This is not 20.This is 5 ℅ 5 ℅ 5 ℅ 5.So what is this going to be?Well 5 ℅ 5 is 25. (5 ℅ 5 = 25.)25 ℅ 5 is 125. (25 ℅ 5 = 125.)125 ℅ 5 is 625. (125 ℅ 5 = 625.)
