welcome to another episode of Fort Bendmathematics tutoring take a moment tosoothe your nervesremember these is just numbers theycan't hurt nobodyhello ladies and gentlemen this is mr.Witte with Fort Bend tutoring FBT andtoday's tutorial is going to be aboutconverting fractions to decimals let'stake a look at it the first thing youshould know about ladies and gentlemenis the place value of your digits so ina number like thirty-four andninety-eight thousand seven hundredsixty-five hundred thousandthsyou need to know that the 3 is in thetens place the four is in the ones placehere you have your decimal nine is inthe tenths place that one place to theright of the decimal is called thetenths place and then your eight is inthe hundredths place the seven is in thethousands place the six is in a tenthousands place your five is in thehundred thousandths place and so forthand so on ladies and gentlemen thesedigits go in either direction toinfinity okay but these are common placevalues that you'll see in your mathclasses all right so let's start out bydoing problem number one here okay andso in 1a we have nine tenths rememberthat the tenths place is just one placeto the right of the decimal so I canwrite my result here as nine tenthsthat's it and yeah you're right youcould write it as nine tenths without azero in the ones place or you can writeit with a zero in the ones place eitherway it's the same result ladies andgentlemen so nine tenths written eitherway is the result that's it so this isthe answer or that's the answer eitherway is fine doesn't matter so next we'regoing to be looking at 1b ladies andgentlemen and in 1b we have sevenhundred forty three hundredths thehundreds place is only going to be twoplaces to the right of the decimal sowhat you're going to ensure is that thethree is two places from the decimal sothat means that your decimal should liebetween the 7 and the four and that's itso you have seven and forty threehundreds I know that the three had to betwo places to the right of the decimalbecause my denominator is 100meaning the hundred this place twoplaces to the right of the decimal sothat's the answer to 1b ladies andgentlemen just like that we have one Cand we have a mixed number here we haveseven and three 100's so I already knowthat the seven belongs to the left ofthe decimal because that's my wholenumber and then here I have threehundredths remember that the hundredthsplace is two places to the right of thedecimal so that means that that 3belongs to places to the right of thedecimal so you have to place a zero inthe tenths place so my answer here isgoing to be seven and three hundredthsto make sure that that three lies twoplaces to the right of the decimal sowherever the hundreds place is that'swhere I need to place my three and thenyou just simply plug in any zeros tofill in the spots in between and sothat's gonna be my answer for one seedone and doneall right and I'm gonna put a red boxaround my answer because that's how Ilike itokay so now we're looking at one D withone D I have twenty three and fortyseven thousand so that whole number isgonna belong to the left of the decimalso I have twenty three then the decimalbecause I'm dealing with 47 being in thethousands place there that means theseven needs to lie that last number 72lie in the thousands place which isthree places from the decimal that meansI need a zero then my four then theseven to make sure that that sevenremains three places from the decimal sothis is the answer that I have here allright okay so for 1e we have negative 91tenths the tenths place is one placefrom the decimal also notice that wehave a negative value in this problem soif you start with the negative resultyou're going to end with a negativeresultso here I'll have a negative value hereand I need to make sure that the onethat last digit of 91 is going to be oneplace from the decimal so bringing down91 will be placed in the decimal betweenthe 9 and the 1 so you end up withnegative 9 and 1/10 as your result andthat's the answerokay that takes care of 1e let's move onall right and our next problem we havetwo fifths there are two ways to goabout changing two fifths into a decimalladies and gentlemen the first way thatworks every single time is to divide thenumerator by the denominator so I canshow that five will go into two usinglong division and I'll show what mydecimal is all rightso since I don't have any values afterthe two that means that the decimal liesbehind the two and you can add as manyzeros as you need to solve the problemI'm gonna go ahead and bring thisdecimal up here and 5 goes into 2 0times 5 goes into 20 four times so 4times 5 is 20 and this will terminate at0 so my answer here is going to be 4tenths that's it four tenths ladies andgentlemen that gives you the result oftwo fifths so two fifths written as adecimal is 4/10 another way to converttwo fifths into a decimal is to takeyour two fifths and try to see if youcan make that five into a power of 10what I mean by a power of 10 is like 10to the first power is 10 10 to thesecond power as 100 10 to the thirdpowers a thousand and so forth and so onI know that five can easily be changedto ten by multiplying 5 times two sowhat you'll do is the following since Ihad to multiply 5 times 2 to get 10 I'llmultiply the numerator by 2 as well andI end up with 4 tenths well 4 tenthsladies and gentlemen is simply writtenas four tens so you can change yourfraction to have a denominator that's apower of 10 and then you can easilytranslate that into its decimal notationso that's two ways to solve to a ladiesand gentlemen changing two fifths into adecimal would be four tenths andremember you can have the zero in frontof the decimal or you can choose not towrite the zero in front of the decimalthey're both the same answer all rightso let's look at to be now and to be wecan convert anion 20s into a decimal byusing a long division I'll have 20 goinginto 9 and showing where the decimal isso here I know that 20 goes into 9 zerotimes I know that 20 will go into ninetyfour times because 4 times 20 is is 80all right then I'm going to subtracthere I'll be bringing down a 1 a 0 and a0 and then 20 goes into 100 five timesso my answer ladies and gentlemen is 45hundredths 45 hundredths as a resultthat's going to be the answer there butthat's not the only way to get it taking9 xx and changing it into a power of 10I know that 20 times 5 is 100 so I caneasily convert 20 into a power of 10 bymultiplying by 5 so 20 times 5 is 100therefore I'll be multiplying thenumerator by 5 as well so 9 times 5gives me 45 and this is simply 45hundredths remember the hundreds placesto places from the decimal so go aheadand write your decimal and you'll need45 right behind it and that's the result45 hundredths just like that twodifferent methods you got itnow as problem to be ladies andgentlemen and now we're onto our nextproblem with problem to see you have 7/2hundredths so using the two differentstrategies that we've learned thus far Ican take this 7 to hundredths and I canstart out by using long division so Ihave 200 as the divisor and I have 7 asthe dividend I'm going to add a coupleof zeros here and bring my decimal up weknow that 200 goes into 7 zero times 200goes into 70 zero times and then 200goes into 700 3 times 3 times 200 is 600so subtracting I'll have 1,000 here nowand 200 goes into a thousand five timesjust like thatso this terminates which means aninnocent zero and I know that my resultis going to be 35 thousandths and that'sthe answer there all rightso that's using long division to convertseven two hundreds into a decimal youcan also do the following you can takethat 7 to hundredths and knowing that Ican convert 200 to 1,000 easily knowingthat the 200 was multiplied by five toget a thousand I'll multiply thenumerator by five as well in seven timesfive is thirty-five so you once againend up with 35 thousandths which iswritten asthirty-five thousands you'll need to putthat five three places from the decimaland this is the answer all right so twodifferent methods and we got that resultdone now we're looking at 2d 2d ladiesand gentlemen if I'm gonna use longdivision to solve this problem I'll havefour as a divisor going into three allright so I went ahead and added a coupleof zeroes there just in case I needed itso four goes into three zero times fourgoes into thirty seven times because 7times 4 is 28 so we'll then subtractI'll bring down a two and a 0 and 4 goesinto 20 how many times exactly 5 timesso your answer is 75 hundredths justlike that and we have decimal notationfor 3/4 working this problem out adifferent way we can go ahead andconvert 3/4 into a decimal by converting4 into a power of 10 4 will easilybecome 100 I know this because 4 times25 gives me 100 so I'll be multiplyingthe numerator also about 25 andmultiplying straight across you'll endup with 7,500 so 75 hundreds means thatthe 5 needs to be in the hundredthsplace two places from the decimal soI'll be having my decimal here a 7 and a5 and I'm done that's it ladies andgentlemen that's the result that's 2ddone and done continuing on in partnumber three I have 3/8 and 3/8 ladiesand gentlemen we could definitely canuse long division to solve this problemso here I can show that 8 as a divisorgoing into 3 showing where my decimal ishere I don't know that I need to bringup my decimal and that 8 goes into 3 0times 8 goes into 30 however 3 times togive me 24 from there I'll besubtracting I'll bring down a 6 & a 0 8goes into 60 seven times because 7 times8 is 56 56 and then we'll be subtractingI'll be bringing down a 4 and I'll bebringing down at zero here and 8 goesinto 40 how many times exactly 5 timesevenly so therefore you end upterminating to find out that the resulthere375 thousands that's the answer toproblem number three now ladies andgentlemen you're thinking to yourselfwell mr. Witt is there a way that I canconvert three eighths into a decimalwithout doing the long division whileyou'll be right so we definitely canconvert three eighths into a decimalusing powers of ten so let's check thatout I'm gonna start out with my threeeights and I'm gonna end up with adenominator of a thousand you get thatby multiplying 8 by 125 so if I multiplythe numerator by 125 3 times 125 is 375so here you have a result of threehundred seventy-five thousandths whichmeans that the 5 needs to be threeplaces from the decimal so I'll end upwith three hundred seventy-fivethousandths and this is my answer sothat's it so you have two methods inorder to get that result you can usepowers of ten changing your denominatorinto ten one hundred or a thousand orten thousand for that matter or you canuse long division and simply divide thenumerator by the denominator and thatgive you your result every time alrightlet's go ahead and move on and problemnumber four we have one six alright nowyou're not converting six into a powerof ten so you only have one strategy touse here to convert one sixth into adecimal we'll be using long division soI have six as my divisor and I'll bringdown as one and I'll show a few zeroshere if I need them I'm gonna bring mydecimal up and I know that six goes intoone zero times and that six goes into 10onceso one times six is six and then I'llsubtract I'll bring down a four then azero six goes into forty six times so 6times 6 is 36 and then I'll besubtracting I bring out a four and thena zero and notice that six goes intoforty six times again so what's gonnahappen ladies and gentlemen this six uphere is gonna continue to repeat alrightit's gonna keep on going on and on andon forever so what you'll do is you'llwrite your result as zero and 16hundreds with a repeating decimal barover the six and only over the sixladies and gents the six that'srepeating so anytime you have arepeating number or a series of numbersthereyou'll use what it's called therepeating decimal bar just like that sothis is my answer to prom number fourthat's it okay let's check out our nextexample in our next example we have twothirds alright so with two thirds onceagain we'll be using long division Ican't change the 3 into a power of 10 itwon't become ten or a hundred or athousand evenly and let's see how manytimes it goes into two I'm going to showa few zeros here so from here ladies andgentlemen we have three going into twozero times all right I'm gonna show mydecimal is and then three goes intotwenty six times that becomes 18 I'll besubtracting bringing down to zero andthen 3 goes into 2006 times again allright so look at there because 6 times 3is still 18 so that means that that sixis going to continue to repeat over andover and over again so what happens iswe write our result as 6/10 with arepeating decimal bar only on the sixbecause only the six is repeating andthis is going to be my answer to problemnumber five just like that all rightin problem number six we have 12 11s allright so with problem number six we'regonna convert this into a decimal byusing long division so I'm gonna have 11going into 12 and I'm gonna show a fewzeros here just for good measure I'mgonna bring that decimal but so 11doesn't go into one but it will go into12 once 1 times 11 is 11 and then yousubtract I'll bring down a 1 and I'llbring down that next zero here then 11goes into 10 zero times and then I'llbring down another zero alright soremember every time I bring it over downyou need to place a number above thedivision symbol 11 goes into 100 ninetimes so nine times 11 that's just 99and then I'll bring down a 1 I'll bringdown another zero and here we have 11going into 10 zero times and then if youadd another zero and bring it downyou'll find that the 11 goes into 100 9times so what's happening here ladiesand gentleman you should notice that thezero and nines are repeating that'srightto write our answer you'll write it asfollows you'll say that your result isgoing to be one in nine hundredthsrepeating with a repeating decimal barover the zero and the nine because asyou see from our long division that'szero and nine keep repeating so youwrite your answer like soone and nine hundreds repeating andthat's itthat's proud number six ladies andgentlemen on to the next one we haveprod umber seven so here in prom numberseven we have four ninths nines notbecoming a power of ten so you don'thave to worry about that strategyremember that strategy only works if youcan make your denominator into ten ahundred a thousand ten thousand aka apower of ten so we'll definitely beusing long division in this problem hereso I'll have my divisor as nine goinginto four and I'm gonna show a few zeroshere for good measure so I brought up mydecimal nine goes into 4 zero times 9goes into 40 however four times so 4times 9 is 36 we'll then subtract I'llbring out a 4 and a zero and nine goesinto 40 yeah four times again look atthat so it looks like we'll be repeatingthe four is up here right they're gonnago on forever so to write this as oursolution will simply say that we havefour tenths repeating and that's theanswer ladies and gentlemen four tenthsrepeating just like that all right Ihave one more problem for you all rightprime number eight let's check it outin problem number eight we have 5/7mm-hmm well one thing's for certainsevens not becoming a power of 10 sowe'll definitely have to use longdivision to convert this fraction into adecimal so here I'm going to show that Ihave seven as my divisor going into fiveand I'm gonna put a few zeros down herejust for good measure all right andlet's see what happens we're gonna haveseven going into five zero times thenseven goes into 57 times we know that 7times 7 is 49 right so they willsubtract I'll bring out a 1 and a 0seven goes into 10 once 1 times 7 is 7let's go ahead and bring that up herewe'll subtract I'll bring down a 3 andI'll bring down another 0 7 goes into 304 times 4 times 7 is 28 I'll bring downis 2 and I'll bring down a 0 7 goes into20 twice so we'll have 2 times 7 thatgives me 14 will subtract I'll bringdown a 6 and a 0 and 7 goes into 60ladies and gentlemen 7 goes into 60that's going to be 8 times so we have 8times here and then 8 times 7 gives me56 you have 60 minus 56 which is 4 we'llbring down another 0 so that'll be 14and then 7 goes into 40 that's going tobe 5 times so we have 5 times right here5 times 7 is 35 all right so you'll bewondering when is this going to end mr.Witt you'll see 7 goes into 50 how manytimes 7 times so ladies and gentlemensays you'll have 7 going up here againremember we had 7 at the beginning ofour division problem that 7 is anindicator especially with the fact thatwe have 50 here and now we have 50 herethat those two 50s are confirming thatthis is going to repeat at this point soyour answer here ladies and gentlemenwith a repeating decimal bar over thatis going to be 714 thousand two hundredeighty five millionths repeating yeahall of those numbers are going to repeaton that problem that's right that 7 1 42 8 5 is going to continue to repeat andthat ladies and gentlemen is the answerto problem number 8 and that concludesthis video so once again this is mr.Witt with Fort Bend tutoring please ratecomment and subscribe and as always ifyou're able to donate
