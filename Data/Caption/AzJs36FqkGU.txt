hey everybody Anthony here from mashupmath and thank you again for stopping byon this lesson we're gonna take a quickvisual and conceptual journey throughthe properties and relationships ofisosceles triangles let's go ahead andget startedwhat's up again everyone thanks forjoining me on this lesson we're gonna goahead and explore the properties ofisosceles triangles so let's start outwith a basic definition that says that atriangle with two congruent sides iscalled isosceles and we could look atsome visual examples herenotice that each of these threetriangles has a pair of congruent sideswhich is denoted by those little slashmarks on the sides that are congruent toeach other and these are all examples ofisosceles triangles their orientationmay be different that is that they areall kind of rotated in a different waybut that actually does not make adifference here so let's go ahead andtake this a step further we're gonna goahead and spin around those twotriangles so that all three of theisosceles triangles are facing the sameway with the congruent sides in the samespot so now let's go ahead and just takea look at these isosceles triangleswithout any markings of angles or sidesand there's an important relationshipthat we want to see here imagine if wewere to vertically cut these trianglesin half right down the middle our resultwould be a right triangle just like theones that are shown and if I take thatright triangle and reflect it over thatvertical line that we imagine cutting inhalf originally our result would be theoriginal isosceles triangles that westarted with oh cool now we will revisitthis relationship later on in the lessonbut for right now just keep this in mindas you're building the concept ofexactly whatah sleaze triangle is okay so now we'reready for our first isosceles triangletheorem which says that if two sides ofa triangle are congruent then the anglesopposite them are also congruent thefirst part of this theorem says that iftwo sides of a triangle are congruent soin this case we're going to say that ifside a B is congruent to size AC thenthe angles opposite of those sides arealso congruent to each other so let'svisualize what that actually means if westarted those two congruent sides and goopposite across from them we arrive atangles b and c and according to thistheorem angle B would be congruent toangle C since they are opposite of sidesthat are congruent to each othernow obviously triangle ABC is isoscelesand take a really good look at thisimage because this is a classicrepresentation of your typical isoscelestriangle where the two sides arecongruent and the two angles the baseangles opposite those sides are alsocongruent so keeping this relationshipin mind will help us to better identifyisosceles triangles in the future thenext isosceles triangle theorem that weare going to look at says that if twoangles of a triangle are congruent thenthe sides opposite them are alsocongruent and this is kind of like thereverse of the theorem that we justlooked at so again if two angles of atriangle are congruent in this caseangle B is congruent to angle C the baseangles then the sides that are oppositethose angles are also congruent so thatwould mean that side a B would have tobe congruent to side AC and that'spretty much how this theorem works andagain because of this relationship wecan conclude that triangle ABC isisoscelesso we just looked at two importantisosceles triangle theorems now let'squickly visually compare these two so weunderstand the difference between themtheorem one said that if two sides in atriangle were congruent and the anglesthat were opposite from them were alsocongruent theorem two said that of twoangles in a triangle were congruent thenthe two sides opposite them are alsocongruent so it's just like a reverseorder between the two and now that we'remore comfortable with the basicdefinition an image of your typicalisosceles triangle let's look at whatelse that we should know about thesekinds of triangles so this is wherewe're going to go back to that righttriangle relationship that we exploredearlier where we looked at an isoscelestriangle as two congruent righttriangles that are kind of back to backor reflected over a vertical line nowsince those triangles are congruent weknow that corresponding angles andcorresponding sides will also becongruent and we see here that thismatches our definition of an isoscelestriangle now with this in mind we cantake this one step further and say thatthe altitude to the base of an isoscelestriangle bisects the vertex angle solet's now visualize what this means ifwe call this triangle triangle d EF andwe draw that altitude from angle D tothe base of the triangle okay we make anew point called G we can say that itbisects the vertex angle that meansangle D is cut into two congruent halvesso if triangle des is isosceles withaltitude DG then our conclusion is thatangle f DG is congruent to angleEDG again because that altitude bisectsthe vertex angle into two congruentpieces now is there anything else thatwe can say about isosceles triangles byusing these relationships now it turnsout that that altitude DG does more thanjust bisect a vertex angle it alsobisects the base so again that line DGwill cut the base that big line Fe againinto two congruent halves and we canconclude that F G would be congruent toeg based on this relationship and againif we think about this in terms of twocongruent right triangles back-to-backwe know that their bases are both goingto be the same so this should make sensenow and it should correspond with ourconceptual understanding of what anisosceles triangle is and what therelationship between the angles andsides are so now that you betterunderstand isosceles triangles here's aclosing thought explain why or why notan equilateral triangle is an isoscelestriangle so think about it and shareyour responses in the comments below I'dlove to hear what
