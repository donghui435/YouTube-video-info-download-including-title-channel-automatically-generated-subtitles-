Find the greatest common
factor of these monomials.Now, the greatest common
factor of anythingis the largest factor
that's divisible into both.If we're talking about just
pure numbers, into both numbers,or in this case,
into both monomials.Now, we have to be
a little bit carefulwhen we talk about
greatest in the contextof algebraic
expressions like this.Because it's greatest
from the point of viewthat it includes the most
factors of each of thesemonomials.It's not necessarily the
greatest possible numberbecause maybe some
of these variablescould take on
negative values, maybethey're taking on
values less than 1.So if you square
it, it's actuallygoing to become
a smaller number.But I think without getting
too much into the weeds there,I think if we just kind of
run through the process of it,you'll understand it
a little bit better.So to find the
greatest common factor,let's just essentially
break down eachof these numbers
into what we couldcall their prime factorization.But it's kind of a combination
of the prime factorizationof the numeric
parts of the number,plus essentially
the factorizationof the variable parts.If we were to
write 10cd squared,we can rewrite
that as the productof the prime factors of 10.The prime factorization
of 10 is just 2 times 5.Those are both prime numbers.So 10 can be broken
down as 2 times 5.c can only be broken down by c.We don't know anything else
that c can be broken into.So 2 times 5 times c.But then the d squared can
be rewritten as d times d.This is what I mean by writing
this monomial essentiallyas the product of
its constituents.For the numeric part of
it, it's the constituentsof the prime factors.And for the rest
of it, we're justkind of expanding
out the exponents.Now, let's do that for 25c
to the third d squared.So 25 right here,
that's 5 times 5.So this is equal to 5 times 5.And then c to the third,
that's times c times c times c.And then d squared,
times d squared.d squared is times d times d.So what's their greatest
common factor in this context?Well, they both
have at least one 5.Then they both have at
least one c over here.So let's just take up one
of the c's right over there.And then they both have two d's.So the greatest common factor
in this context, the greatestcommon factor of
these two monomialsis going to be the factors
that they have in common.So it's going to be equal to
this 5 times-- we only have onec in common, times--
and we have twod's in common, times d times d.So this is equal to 5cd squared.And so 5d squared, we can kind
of view it as the greatest.But I'll put that
in quotes dependingon whether c is
negative or positiveand d is greater
than or less than 0.But this is the greatest common
factor of these two monomials.It's divisible
into both of them,and it uses the most
factors possible.
