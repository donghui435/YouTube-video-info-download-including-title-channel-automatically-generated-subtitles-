let's look at an interesting problembased on the formula we have studied inprobability - fair dice are thrown whatis the probability of getting a sum of11 trust methis is really interesting to dice ourthroats simultaneously and we are askedthe probability of getting a sum of 11let's call this dice d1 and the other d2each of these dyes will show a number Ineed you to think hard as to which twonumbers will give us a sum of 11 well wecan get a 5 on d1 and 6 on d2 the sumequals 11 and there is anothercombination that can give us 11 we canget 6 on d1 and 5 on d2 is there anyother possibility in which we get thesum as 11 no there isn'tit means these are the only twopossibilities 5 and 6 or 6 and 5 soprobability of getting a sum of 11 canbe written as probability of getting a 5on d1 and 6 on d2 or getting a 6 on d1and 5 on d2 do not get confusing thislong expression these are the two thingswe are talking about this is the firstevent where we get a 5 on d1 and 6 on d2and this is the second one in which weget a 6 on D 1 and a 5 on d2we use or since it can be either this orthis it doesn't matter as we get the sumas 11 in each case let this be event aand let this be event B so what weessentially need to find is probabilityof A or B using the formula we write itas P of A plus P of B minus P of aintersection B let me ask you aninteresting question do you think thesetwo events can happen together that'simpossible because if we get a 5 on d1and six on D - you cannot get a six ond1 and a five on D - so the events a andB are mutually exclusive probability ofa intersection B will be zero as thereis no chance that both can occurtogether let's zoom out a bit since thisis zero the formula becomes P of a plusP of B now we just need to find thesetwo probabilities what is P of a it'sthis five on d1 and 6 on d2 notice thata and B both each are considered twoevents these two events for a and thesetwo for be looking at events of a we cansay that these two events areindependent as the outcome of one doesnot affect the other and probability ofeach is 1 by 6 so P of a can be writtenas 1 by 6 multiplied by 1 by 6 this 1 by6 is the probability of getting a 5 ond1 and this 1 by 6 is the probability ofgetting a 6 on D 2 and similarly P of Bcan also be written as 1 by 6 multipliedby 1 by 6 that will give us 1 by 36 + 1by 36 which is 2 by 36 simplifying thisfraction we can write it as 1 by 18 sothe probability of getting a sum of 11at the throw of two dice is 1 by 18there is a quicker way to solve problemsbased on two dice which we will seelateryouyou
