[Music]in the circle universe there are tworelated and key terms they are centralangles and intercepted arcs we'll startoff with the central angle key facet ofessential angles that's vertex is at thecenter of the circle this equation downhere says that the measure of angle ABCwhich is our central angle is equal tothe measure of the arc AC well we callthat arc AC the intercepted arc justlike a football pass intercept so from Ato C notice those are also the placewhere the central angle intersects thecircle so this is called our interceptedarc and for central angles they willalways be congruent to their interceptedarc in this picture right here I'vedrawn something that is not a centralangle the reason is its vertex is on thecircle not at the center of the circleif we look at congruent courts in acircle so I've drawn two congruentchords I've said two important thingsthat congruent chords have congruentcentral angles which means I can saythat these two central angles must becongruent and how could I prove thatwell if you look at these two sides thatI've marked congruent and if you look atthe other two sides of the triangle wesee that they are radii so these two arecongruent and these two radii are allcongruent so we could use aside-side-side conjecture to say thatthese two triangles must be congruenttherefore their central angles are alsocongruent one other consequence of thisis that they also will have congruentintercepted arcs so I could say thatthis arc right here which is formed bythat congruent chord it is congruent tothat intercepted arc so lots ofinteresting things going on with centralangles and intercepted arcs that willhelp us find missing measures
