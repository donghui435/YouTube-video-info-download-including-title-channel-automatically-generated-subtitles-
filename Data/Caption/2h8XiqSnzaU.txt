Identify 15/8, or 15
over 8, as a properor an improper fraction.So this is actually
just a good reviewof proper and
improper fractions.And there's a pretty easy
way to identify them.You have a proper fraction if
your numerator-- so this righthere is your numerator,
the number on top.Let me just label them,
numerator and denominator.You have a proper
fraction if your numeratoris less than your denominator.And if you don't have
a proper fraction,you have an improper fraction.So your improper fraction
is if your numeratoris greater than or equal
to your denominator.And over here, actually, all
the numbers are positive.But if you had some
negative numbers here,then you would actually say the
absolute value of the numeratoris less than the absolute
value of the denominator,for a proper fraction.And the absolute
value of the numeratoris greater than or equal
to the absolute valueof the denominator for
an improper fraction.So let me just write
that down, justto be a little bit
more particular here,because we could have negative
numbers in either the numeratoror the denominator.Anyway, let's go
back to this problem.15 is clearly greater
than or equal to 8.So 15 is greater
than or equal to 8,so we are dealing with
an improper fraction.
