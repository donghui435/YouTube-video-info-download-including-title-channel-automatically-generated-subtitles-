- WELCOME TO A LESSON 
ON GEOMETRIC SERIES.THE GOAL OF THIS VIDEO IS 
TO DETERMINE THE PARTIAL SUMOF A GEOMETRIC SERIES.SUMMING OR ADDING THE TERMS 
OF A GEOMETRIC SEQUENCECREATES WHAT IS CALLED 
A SERIES.SO HERE WE HAVE
A GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE,AND HERE WE HAVE 
A GEOMETRIC SERIES.NOTICE A SEQUENCE IS A LIST, 
AND A SERIES IS A SUM.THE PARTIAL SUM OF THE FIRST 
Nth TERMS OF A GEOMETRIC 
SERIESIS GIVEN BY THIS FORMULA:S SUB N = A SUB 1 
x THE QUANTITY 1 - RTO THE POWER OF N 
DIVIDED BY 1 - R.LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOKAT WHERE THIS FORMULA 
COMES FROM.IF WE WERE TO START WITH 
THE FOLLOWING GEOMETRIC SERIESAS WE SEE HERE,A SUB 1 + A SUB 1 x R + A SUB 
1 x R SQUARED AND SO ON,ALL THE WAY OUT TO A SUB 1 x R 
TO THE POWER OF N - 1.IF WE TAKE THIS FIRST EQUATIONAND MULTIPLY BOTH SIDES 
OF THE EQUATION BY R,WE WOULD HAVE R x S =,AND EACH OF THESE TERMS 
PICKS UP AN EXTRA FACTOR OF R.SO NOW, THE FIRST TERM IS A 
SUB 1 x R, AND THE LAST TERM,INSTEAD OF A SUB 1 x R 
TO THE N -1,WOULD BE A SUB 1 x R 
TO THE POWER OF N.NEXT, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DOIS SUBTRACT 
THESE TWO EQUATIONS.WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 
S SUB N - R x S SUB N,AND IF WE DO THIS, MOST OF 
THE TERMS WILL SIMPLIFY OUT.FOR EXAMPLE, HERE WE'D HAVE 
A SUB 1 x R - A SUB 1 x R,A SUB 1 x R SQUARED - A SUB 1 
R SQUARED AND SO ON,ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE ENDWHERE WE'D BE LEFT WITH A SUB 
1 x R TO THE POWER OF N.SO THIS DIFFERENCE WOULD BE 
= A SUB 1 - A SUB 1 RTO THE POWER OF N.NOW, IF WE TAKE THE LEFT SIDE 
OF THE EQUATIONAND FACTOR OUT THE COMMON 
FACTOR OF S SUB N,WE'D HAVE S SUB N 
x THE QUANTITY OF 1 - R= A SUB 1 - A SUB 1 R 
TO THE POWER OF N.NOW WE COULD DIVIDE BOTH SIDES 
OF THE EQUATION BY 1 - R,AND NOW, 
THERE'S ONLY ONE MORE STEP.SO IF WE FACTOR OUT A SUB 1 
IN THE NUMERATOR,WE WOULD HAVE A SUB 1 
x THE QUANTITY 1 - RTO THE POWER OF N 
ALL DIVIDED BY 1 - R,AND THIS IS THE FORMULA 
THAT WE'LL USETO FIND THE PARTIAL SUM 
OF A GEOMETRIC SERIES.LET'S GO AND TAKE A LOOK 
AT A COUPLE EXAMPLES.HERE WE HAVE 
A GEOMETRIC SERIES.THE FORMULA THAT WE'RE GOING 
TO USE IS LISTED HERE.WE'LL HAVE S SUB N WITH 
THE SUM OF THE FIRST N TERM= A SUB 1 x 1 - R TO THE POWER 
OF N DIVIDED BY 1 - R.SO WE NEED TO FIND A SUB 1,R AND N BEFORE WE CAN USE 
THIS FORMULA.WELL, A SUB 1 IS THE FIRST 
TERM, WHICH IS 3.WE CAN DETERMINE R 
BY USING THE FORMULA HEREWHERE WE SELECT ANY TERM 
IN THE SERIESAND DIVIDE BY THE TERM 
BEFORE IT.SO IF WE USE A SUB 2, 
WE WOULD DIVIDE BY A SUB 1.6 DIVIDED BY 3 = 2.SO R = 2, AND NOW, 
WE HAVE TO DETERMINE N,WHICH WOULD BE THE NUMBER 
OF TERMS IN THIS SERIES.AND WE CAN USE THIS FORMULA 
HERE FROM OUR STUDIESOF A GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE 
TO DETERMINE N.IF WE LET A SUB N 
= THE LAST TERM,THIS N HERE WILL REPRESENT THE 
NUMBER OF TERMS IN THE SERIES.SO A SUB N = A SUB 1 x R 
TO THE POWER OF N - 1.SO A SUB N = 1,536.A SUB 1 = 3.R = 2, AND WE HAVE 
TO THE POWER OF N-1.WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS EQUATION 
FOR N.SO LET'S DIVIDE BOTH SIDES 
BY 3.THIS WILL GIVE US 512 
ON THE LEFTAND 2 TO THE POWER OF N - 1 
ON THE RIGHT.NOW, 512 CAN BE WRITTEN 
AS A POWER OF 2.IT'S ACTUALLY 2 RAISED 
TO THE POWER OF 9.SO FROM THAT, 
WE CAN DRAW THE CONCLUSIONTHAT 9 MUST = N - 1.SO IF WE ADD 1 TO BOTH SIDES 
OF THE EQUATION,WE KNOW THAT N MUST = 10.THIS IS ALL THE INFORMATION 
WE NEEDTO USE THIS PARTIAL SUM 
FORMULA.SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND SEEIF WE CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION 
NOW.THE SUM OF THE FIRST 10 TERMS 
WILL BE EQUAL TO 3 x 1 - RTO THE POWER OF NOR 2 TO THE 10th DIVIDED 
BY 1 - R, WHICH, AGAIN, = 2.LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND GO TO OUR CALCULATORAND SEE IF WE CAN DETERMINE 
THIS PARTIAL SUM.LET'S TAKE A LOOK 
AT THE NUMERATOR FIRST.WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 3 
x THE QUANTITY 1 - 2TO THE POWER OF 10.THERE'S OUR NUMERATOR,AND WE'RE GOING TO DIVIDE BY 
1 - 2, WHICH OF COURSE, IS -1.SO WE HAVE 3,069 
FOR THIS PARTIAL SUM.LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK 
AT ANOTHER EXAMPLE.ON THIS PROBLEM WE HAVE 
THE FORMULATHAT WILL GENERATE THE TERMS 
IN THE SERIESWHEN WE ALSO KNOW THERE WILL 
BE 5 TERMS BECAUSE N = 5.SO AGAIN, LET'S WRITE OUT 
OUR FORMULA.WE WANT THE SUM OF THE FIRST 5 
TERMS, BECAUSE WE KNOW N = 5.SO TO FIND THE FIRST TERM,WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE 
THIS FORMULA A SUB 1 = 2 x -3RAISED TO THE POWER OF N -1.WELL, IF N = 1, 1 - 1 
WOULD BE 0.-3 TO THE 0 POWER = 1.SO WE HAVE 2 x 1 OR 2.NOW, WE DO HAVE TO FIND R.IF WE CAN'T LOOK 
AT THIS FORMULA HEREAND SEE WHAT R WOULD BE,WE WOULD HAVE TO FIND 
ONE MORE TERM.SO WE COULD USE THIS FORMULA 
HERE TO DETERMINE R.LET'S ASSUME 
WE CAN'T DETERMINE RBY LOOKING AT THE FORMULA.LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND FIND THE SECOND TERM.SO WE WOULD HAVE 2 x -3 
TO THE POWER OF 2 - 1RTO THE FIRST POWER.-3 TO THE FIRST = -3 x 2, 
THAT'S -6.SO R WOULD BE EQUAL 
TO THE SECOND TERMDIVIDED BY THE FIRST TERM OR -
6 DIVIDED BY 2, WHICH = -3.AND AGAIN, BASED UPON 
YOUR EXPERIENCE,YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE 
THAT IN THE FORMULA HERE.IT'S THE BASE, 
AND WE'RE ALSO GIVEN N = 5.THAT SHOULD BE ALL 
THE INFORMATION WE NEED.LET'S GO AHEAD AND SEE IF WE 
CAN FIND THIS PARTIAL SUM.THE SUM OF THE FIRST FIVE 
TERMS = A SUB 1,WHICH IS 2 x 1 - R 
RAISED TO THE POWER OF N.ALL DIVIDED BY 1 - R.WE DO HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT 
CAREFUL ABOUT THE SIGNS HERE.LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND GO TO OUR CALCULATOR.LET'S TAKE A LOOK 
AT THE NUMERATOR FIRST.WE HAVE 2 x THE QUANTITY 1 
- (-3) TO THE POWER OF 5.THERE'S OUR NUMERATOR,AND WE'RE GOING TO DIVIDE THIS 
BY -- LOOKS LIKE 1 - (-3),WHICH WOULD BE 4.WE HAVE A PARTIAL SUM OF 122.OKAY. THAT'S GOING TO DO IT 
FOR THIS VIDEO.I HOPE YOU FOUND IT HELPFUL.THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
