I've already made videos on the
arcsine and the arctangent, soto kind of complete the
trifecta, I might as well makea video on the arccosine.And just like the other inverse
trigonometric functions, thearccosine is kind of the
same thought process.If I were to tell you the arc,
no, I'm doing cosine, if ourtell you that arccosine
of x is equal to theta.This is an equivalent statement
to saying that the inversecosine of x is equal to theta.These are just two different
ways of writing theexact same thing.And as soon as I see either an
arc- anything, or an inversetrig function in general, my
brain immediatelyrearranges this.My brain immediately says, this
is saying that if I take thecosine of some angle theta,
that I'm going to get x.Or that same statement up here.Either of these should
boil down to this.If I say, you know, what is the
inverse cosine of x, my brainsays, what angle can I take
the cosine of to get x?So with that said, let's
try it out on an example.Let's say that I have the arc,
I'm told, no, two c's there,I'm told to evaluate the
arccosine of minus 1/2.My brain, you know, let's say
that this is going to be equalto, it's going to be
equal to some angle.And this is equivalent to
saying that the cosine ofmy mystery angle is
equal to minus 1/2.And as soon as you put it in
this way, at least for mybrain, it becomes a lot
easier to process.So let's draw our unit circle
and see if we can makesome headway here.So that's my, let me see if I
can draw a little straighter.Maybe I could actually draw,
put rulers here, and if I puta ruler here, maybe I can
draw a straight line.Let me see.No, that's too hard.OK, so that is my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.Not the most neatly drawn
axes ever, but it'll do.Let me draw my unit circle.Looks more like a unit ellipse,
but you get the idea.And the cosine of an angle as
defined on the unit circledefinition is the x-value
on the unit circle.So if we have some angle,
the x-value is going tobe equal a minus 1/2.So we got a minus
1/2 right here.And so the angle that we have
to solve for, our theta, is theangle that when we intersect
the unit circle, thex-value is minus 1/2.So let me see, this is
the angle that we'retrying to figure out.This is theta that we
need to determine.So how can we do that?So this is minus
1/2 right here.Let's figure out these
different angles.And the way I like to think
about it is, I like to figureout this angle right here.And if I know that angle, I can
just subtract that from 180degrees to get this light blue
angle that's kind of thesolution to our problem.So let me make this triangle
a little bit bigger.So that triangle, let
me do it like this.That triangle looks
something like this.Where this distance
right here is 1/2.That distance right
there is 1/2.This distance right here is 1.Hopefully you recognize
that this is going to bea 30, 60, 90 triangle.You could actually solve
for this other side.You'll get the square
root of 3 over 2.And to solve for that other
side you just need to dothe Pythagorean theorem.Actually, let me just do that.Let me just call this, I don't
know, just call this a.So you'd get a squared,
plus 1/2 squared, whichis 1/4, which is equal to
1 squared, which is 1.You get a squared is equal to
3/4, or a is equal to thesquare root of 3 over 2.So you immediately know this
is a 30, 60, 90 triangle.And you know that because the
sides of a 30, 60, 90 triangle,if the hypotenuse is 1, are 1/2
and square root of 3 over 2.And you also know that the side
opposite the square root of3 over 2 side is 60 degrees.That's 60, this is 90.This is the right angle, and
this is 30 right up there.But this is the one
we care about.This angle right here we just
figured out is 60 degrees.So what's this?What's the bigger angle
that we care about?What is 60 degrees
supplementary to?It's supplementary
to 180 degrees.So the arccosine, or the
inverse cosine, letme write that down.The arccosine of minus 1/2
is equal to 120 degrees.Did I write 180 there?No, it's 180 minus the 60, this
whole thing is 180, so this is,right here is, 120
degrees, right?120 plus 60 is 180.Or, if we wanted to write that
in radians, you just write 120degrees times pi radian per 180
degrees, degrees cancel out.12 over 18 is 2/3, so it
equals 2 pi over 3 radians.So this right here is equal
to 2 pi over 3 radians.Now, just like we saw in the
arcsine and the arctangentvideos, you probably say, hey,
OK, if I have 2 pi over 3radians, that gives me
a cosine of minus 1/2.And I can write that.
cosine of 2 pi over 3is equal to minus 1/2.This gives you the same
information as thisstatement up here.But I can just keep going
around the unit circle.For example, I could, how
about this point over here?Cosine of this angle, if I were
to add, if I were to go thisfar, would also be minus 1/2.And then I could go 2 pi
around and get back here.So there's a lot of values that
if I take the cosine of thoseangles, I'll get
this minus 1/2.So we have to
restrict ourselves.We have to restrict the
values that the arccosinefunction can take on.So we're essentially
restricting it's range.We're restricting it's range.What we do is we restrict it's
range to this upper hemisphere,the first and second quadrants.So if we say, if we make the
statement that the arccosineof x is equal to theta,
we're going to restrict ourrange, theta, to that top.So theta is going to be greater
than or equal to 0 and lessthan or equal to 2 pi.Less, oh sorry, not 2 pi.Less than or equal
to pi, right?Where this is also 0
degrees, or 180 degrees.We're restricting ourselves
to this part of thehemisphere right there.And so you can't do this, this
is the only point where thecosine of the angle
is equal minus 1/2.We can't take this angle
because it's outsideof our range.And what are the
valid values for x?Well any angle, if I take
the cosine of it, it can bebetween minus 1 and plus 1.So x, the domain for the
arccosine function, is goingto be x has to be less than
or equal to 1 and greaterthan or equal to minus 1.And once again, let's
just go check our work.Let's see if the value I got
here, that the arccosine ofminus 1/2 really is 2 pi over
3 as calculated by the TI-85. We turn it on.So i need to figure out the
inverse cosine, which is thesame thing as the arccosine
of minus 1/2, of minus 0.5.It gives me that decimal,
that strange number.Let's see if that's the
same thing as 2 pi over 3.2 times pi divided by
3 is equal to, thatexact same number.So the calculator gave me
the same value I got.But this is kind of a
useless, well, it'snot a useless number.It's a valid, that
is the answer.But it doesn't, it's not
a nice clean answer.I didn't know that this
is 2 pi over 3 radians.And so when we did it using
the unit circle, we wereable to get that answer.So hopefully, actually let
me ask you, let me justfinish this up with an
interesting question.And this applies
to all of them.If I were to ask you, you know,
say I were to take thearccosine of x, and then I were
to take the cosine of that,what is this going
to be equal to?Well, this statement right here
can be said, well, let's saythat the arccosine of x is
equal to theta, that means thatthe cosine of theta is
equal to x, right?So if the arccosine of x
is equal to theta, we canreplace this with theta.And then the cosine of theta,
well the cosine of theta is x.So this whole thing
is going to be x.Hopefully I didn't get
confuse you there, right?I'm saying look, arccosine
of x, just call that theta.Now, by definition, this
means that the cosineof theta is equal to x.These are equivalent
statements.These are completely equivalent
statements right here.So if we put a theta right
there, we take the cosine oftheta, it has to be equal to x.Now let me ask you a bonus,
slightly trickier question.What if I were to ask you,
and this is true for anyx that you put in here.This is true for any x, any
value between negative 1 and 1including those two endpoints,
this is going to be true.Now what if I were ask you
what the arccosine ofthe cosine of theta is?What is this going
to be equal to?My answer is, it
depends on the theta.So, if theta is in the, if
theta is in the range, if thetais between, if theta is between
0 and pi, so it's in our valida range for, kind of, our range
for the product of thearccosine, then this
will be equal to theta.If this is true for theta.But what if we take some
theta out of that range?Let's try it out.Let's take, so let me do one
with theta in that range.Let's take the arccosine of
the cosine of, let's just doone of them that we know.Let's take the cosine
of, let's stick withcosine of 2 pi over 3. Cosine of 2 pi over 3 radians,
that's the same thing asthe arccosine of minus 1/2.Cosine of 2 pi over
3 is minus 1/2.We just saw that in the
earlier part of this video.And then we solved this.We said, oh, this is
equal to 1 pi over 3.So for in the range of thetas
between 0 and pi it worked.And that's because the
arccosine function canonly produce values
between 0 and pi.But what if I were to ask you,
what is the arccosine of thecosine of, I don't
know, of 3 pi.So if I were to draw the unit
circle here, let me draw theunit circle, a real quick one.And that's my axes.What's 3 pi?2 pi is if I go around once.And then I go around another
pi, so I end up right here.So I've gone around 1 1/2
times the unit circle.So this is 3 pi.What's the x-coordinate here?It's minus 1.So cosine of 3 pi
is minus 1, right?So what's arccosine of minus 1?Arccosine of minus 1.Well remember, the range, or
the set of values, thatarccosine can evaluate to is
in this upper hemisphere.It's between, this can
only be between pi and 0.So arccosine of negative 1
is just going to be pi.So this is going to be pi.Arccosine of negative, this
is negative 1, arccosineof negative 1 is pi.And that's a reasonable
statement, because thedifference between 3 pi and pi
is just going around the unitcircle a couple of times.And so you get an equivalent,
it's kind of, you're at theequivalent point on
the unit circle.So I just thought I would
throw those two at you.This one, I mean this
is a useful one.Well, actually, let
me write it up here.This one is a useful one.The cosine of the arccosine of
x is always going to be x.I could also do that with sine.The sine of the arcsine of
x is also going to be x.And these are just useful
things to, you shouldn't justmemorize them, because
obviously you might memorize itthe wrong way, but you should
just think a little bit aboutit, and you'll never forget It.
