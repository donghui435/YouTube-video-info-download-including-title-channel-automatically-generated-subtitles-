all right in this video I'm going to doan example of solving an equation withrational exponents so in this casenotice on the left side we have thisquadratic equation or this quadraticexpression it's being raised to the 1/5power on the right side we just have a Wbut it's being raised to the 2/5 powerso what a lot of times what I try to dowith these is I try to get rid of thefractions okay at least get rid of thedenominators and the idea in this onesince we have notice that both of thefractions have a denominator of 5 sowhat that tells me I can do is I canactually raise both sides to the fifthpower because remember if you havethings in parenthesis what happens forexample on the left side between the 1/5and the 5 since it's in parenthesisalgebraically we multiply those so 5times 1/5 is just gonna leave us withsomething to the first power so we'llreally be left with W squared plus 8 wminus 3 all to the first power but wecan equivalently rewrite that withsimply no exponents at all on the leftside likewise on the right side if wetake 2 over 5 times 5 again so 2 over 5times 5 over 1 we could even just makethat ted over 5 which is 2 or again the5s cancel but the main idea is we'rejust left with a W squared on the rightside and again now this to me is a niceequation I can simply subtract W squaredfrom both sides that's gonna leave mewith 8 w minus 3 on the left and just 0on the right so now this is just a nicelittle linear equation so I'm gonna add3 to both sides and get 8 W equals 3 I'mgoing to divide by 8 and get W equals3/8 as my solution to this originalequation
