okay in this video I just want to talkabout quadratic inequalities and I justwant to talk about a really commonmistake people make so don't do what I'mabout to do so a second ago or in myother video we actually solved thisquadratic equation x squared plus 2xminus 8 and we came up with thesolutions negative infinity to negative4 and then 2 to infinity a lot of timeswhat people will do so again what I'mabout to do is very much incorrect sodon't do what I'm about to do but it'sbasically I see itI see it all the time okay so you canfactor x squared plus 2x minus 8 wefactored that a second ago as X plus 4and then X minus 2 so our inequality hasto be greater than or equal to 0and now what people will do is they'lljust you know if it was an equation youset each piece equal to 0 but if it's aninequality you can't do the followingpeople still want to do the same thingthey want to take X plus 4 and make thatgreater than or equal to 0 and then theywant to take X minus 2 and make thatgreater than or equal to 0 so the stuffdown here again was the actual correctsolutionbefore I lose my focus here and thenthey'll subtract four and they say wellX has to be greater than or equal tonegative four and then it says if yousolve this by adding two it says X hasto be greater than or equal to two sowhat does that mean does it have okay soit has to be greater than negative fouror two or is it have to do both of thesein either case I think you're gonna seethat definitely you're not going to getthis part of the the solution that wefound before so this parts okay writingit but doing this step where you takeeach piece and make it greater than orequal to or less than or equal to orwhatever it is that is very muchincorrect again you have to make thisnumber line and check all the points soI just want to point this out so thathopefully you won't do it alright goodluck
