g'day welcome to tech math Channel whatwe're gonna be having a look at in thisvideo is a way of working the squareroot out of numbers these are going tobe looking where we've got the squareperfect squares that are occurring lessthan 100 but we haven't with these outin just secondsokay so I'll show you how to do thisanyway so first off we'll give you anexample so how fast can you work at thesquare root of 576 I'll give you acouple of seconds okay times upyeah did you get the answer of positiveor minus 24 if you did that's that'sthat's great you got the right answerthere if not I'm gonna show you how tothrough these you know just by the waybefore I get any further the square rootiya it's really important that youactually identify this as a positive ornegative answer because say negative 24times negative 24 gives us the answer526 the same way 24 times 24 gives us Yan answer of 576 so just before I go onjust just make a note of thathaving said that I'm probably not gonnaworry about doing the positive and minusfor the the rest of these numbers hereI'm just gonna put them down as numbersand you can assume that there's apositive or minus there so I'm gonnashow you how we do this and it's goingto involve knowing your squares all theway up to I've done it up to ninebecause I think you should probably knowit N squared I think you should knowthese already anyway I think probablymost of you will but you're gonna seethat I've got to shot it down here thesquares 1 squared is 1 2 squared is 4 3squared is 9 4 squared is 16 and so onand so forth we're gonna be using thesea fair bit you're also going to noticefirst off that I've actually uh put theunits of these in a different color I'mjust gonna draw your attention to thoseactually right now we'll be first areworking out our answer here so why don'twe do it is as follows the way we workat square root of 576 using this is asfollows okay sofirst thing we do is we have a look atthis particular units answer the numberhere the Kahless six and we're lookingfor a square root here the correspondsto this or a square sorry it's squarethat corresponds to this so 16 does and36 does the square root that goesalongside of those we have 4 when we'retalking about our 16 and we have 6 whenwe're talking about 36 so we're answeris going to finish you know 4 or 6 andwe're gonna work out for sure which onethis is in a little second but first offwe have to work out now ere are ourfirst digit so I'm gonna cross outthere's two digits that's next thing youdo and we just still directly now withthis five okay yeah we're gonna have alook here along here in ear squareanswers here we're looking for a numberthat flickers just below five so it'sonly gonna be the number five itself orthe one closest to five which is underokay so gonna go along here and you cansee one four fours just under five andnines too much so we're gonna be dealingwith this for now the square root offour is two twos the first part of ouranswerokay now we're always there now we haveto just working out whether or not we'redealing with is it 24 or 26 is ouranswer and the way we do this as followsis we get out to here and we justmultiply by the next number up okay andI mean the next number up from 2 whichis 3 so 2 times 3 equals 6 now we have alook at this 6 and pretty much what wedo is as follows it is 5 here is lessthan this 6 we choose the lesser numberokayif it was more we choose the biggernumber okay so 2 times 3 is 6 5 is lessthan 6 so we choose the lesser numberhere so we're answer it's 24okay that's a bit of going through I'lltell you what we'll go through a couplemore of these you'll pick them up as wego along and then what I recommend isyou probably are be able to startpausing it and giving it a go okay solet's get into another one of these sowhat about we do 1849 are we gonna workout the square root of this so first offonce again what we do is we're lookingat this diet here okay they died and thenumber that goes along without knowingcould either be a three or a sevenyou notice these complimentary numbersadd up to 10 to it so it's kind of ahandy little thing the next thing I dois I cross out these two numbersokay so answers gonna finish it a threeor a seven now I look at this 18 so 18and I go down here and I'm looking and16 just occurs below 18 25 too much sothe square root of 16 is 4 the firstpart of our answer is 4 okay 4 times 5okay4 times 5 is 20 and now I compare thisto 18 here so 18 as you'll see is lessthan 20 so we choose once again thelesser number okay so we're answer is 43you get faster and faster and faster ofthese okay keep practicing them you willget used to doing them okay okay whatabout one more of these are 3364 okaypause it give it a go okay so looking atthe last number here it could be eitheror two or an eight okay so let's crossout these two digits here and now whatwe do is we are looking for that firstdigit okay so it's going to be a fiveokay you're probably working that outreally really quickly okay because fivefive is twenty five six six is thirtysix that's too much isn't it so let's gofive times six five times six is thirty33 is bigger then 30 so we're gonnachoose the bigger number we have aneightso our answeris 58 okay what about another one whatabout we have a different one here we'lldo2025 now this is a nice and easy oneyou'll see why okay pause it and give ita gookay so 2025 you're gonna see that canonly be a 5 at the end here becausethere's no other optionokay cross it out and then we're lookingfor the number which is going to beoccurring under here okay so 4 squaredis gonna be 16 5 squids too much so it'sgoing to be a 4 but this Cerreta becausewe don't need to differentiate betweenwhether it's a five or it's at fiveisn't it so 45 times 45 that's ouranswerpretty cool right okay couple more ofthese just about three more of theseI'll put them out there I recommend themand see here you goso five thousand one hundred and eightyfour okay so our last number couldeither be a 2 or an 8 okay 7 squared is49 so this is gonna be a 7 okay7 times 8 is 56 and 56 is 50 ones lessthan 56 so we're going to choose the twookaythis is how I start doing these in myhead I'm gonna start doing the more andmore like this going to do the rest ofmy that I reckon sowhat about 1444 okay so the last numberhere could be a 2 or it could be an 8okay so 14 16 squares are for squarestoo much three squares good so it'sgoing to be three three fours are twelvefourteen greater than 12 so we're gonnachoose the greater number which is an 838all right lucky last one out of all themis 8281 okay so as you see here 81 well81 we could I'm on the a look at thelast time here no it's sort of temptingto go hating one that hey wait a secondthat's dying I'm really gonna look atthe last digit here so 81 it could be aone or a Naaman okay so what we'll donow is we'll cross that out and 82okay so 82 yeah once again this is gonnabe annoying okay it's not enough becausethat's not necessarily annoying so we'vegot nine okay so 9 times 10 is 90 82 isless than 90 so I'm gonna choose alesser value we're gonna 91 anyway whatdid you think of that particular trickthere it's that's not a bad trick okayit does take a bit of getting used tobut once you get used to what it'sactually fairly handy I kind it's agreat little way of working about youstarts me out of work the mount as yousee towards the end much much much muchmuch faster okayand yeah you will make the odd mistakebut they everybody does this and now ina future a couple of videos I am gonnabe looking at about how to work out theare how to calculate squares of anynumber okay the laborious slow out doingthis but it's not the slowest way everjust a nice little trick for doing theseand something you may or may not knowhow to do already you know thanks forwatching see you next time bye
