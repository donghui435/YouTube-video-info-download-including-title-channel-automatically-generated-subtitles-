- So let's talk about the unitof measurement called the "gram."And the gram is a unit of
measurement for measuring mass.Now, what is mass?Well, you might have seen
in everyday language,someone might look at a feather,let me see if I can draw a good feather.So a feather like this.And say, "Hey, this is not very massive."This is not massive.And notice, you have that
word "mass" in there.And then they might point
to some big boulder,some big heavy boulder, let
me draw a big heavy boulder.And say, "This is massive."This is massive.And so, just with those examples,you might get an intuition
for what mass is.It's how much stuff there is,
and it's related to weight.And I said "related to weight,"not the same thing as weight,because later on when you take Physics,you will learn that mass
and weight are related,but that they're not
exactly the same thing.Now, if you're on a given planet,and the same distance from
the center of that planet,roughly speaking, mass and weightwill be strongly related to each other.Something with more mass is
going to have more weight.Two things with the same mass,once again if I'm on the same planet,at the same distance from
the center of the planet,they're going to have the same weight.So you'll often hear people say,"How many grams does that thing weigh?"They really should be saying,"How many grams does that thing mass,"but it's okay, because as long
as we're staying on earth,roughly you know, at sea level,
plus or minus a little bit,or even if we're a little bit
further away from sea level,mass and weight, it's not crazyto hold them a little bit interchangeable.And one way to gauge something's massis to hold it if you can, and say,"Okay, how much does this weigh,"because the more something weighs,the more its mass is going to be.The more something's mass is going to be,the more it's going to weigh, once again,assuming we're on the planet, etc., etc.When you take Physics
class, you'll learn thatthey are different concepts thatare closely related to each other.So, that's what a gram is.Now, another thing that you will seein the context of mass and measuring mass,is the kilogram.And all the kilogram is,
and you're going to seethe prefix "kilo-" over and over again,in your, I guess your education careers,especially when you're
thinking about units.But "kilo-" is just a prefix for 1000.So that literally means 1000 grams.So instead of saying "2000 grams,"I could say "2 kilograms."So with that out of the way, let's seeif we can get a sense for what one gramor different numbers
of grams of masses areand what might have a mass of one kilogramor 10 kilograms or 100 kilograms.And that's exactly why I got
all of these pictures prepared.So if, if you want to
get a sense of somethingthat has a mass of one
gram, think of a paper clip.And I have this little
squiggly thing here,because that right there,
that means "roughly."Every paper clip isn't
going to be exactly 1 gram;it might be 1 1/2 grams, it might besmall paper clips that are 1/2 gram.But it gives you the sense ofwhat would have a mass of 1 gram.And if you want to know how
much something with a massof 1 gram weighs on the
surface of the earth,well, you could just hold that
paper clip and kind of judge,feel how much it's
pulling down on your hand.Now, or how much the weight of itis pushing down on your
hand, I guess I could say.Now, if you want to get a sense of thingsthat are little bit more massive,a pencil is five times as
massive as a paper clip.And hopefully you'll see that,
if you hold five paper clipson one side and a pencil
on the other side,you'll see that they
roughly have the same mass,and their weight will be roughly the same.Now, a little bit more massive,you could think of a field mouse.A field mouse is equivalent to the massof roughly 4 pencils, or 20 paperclips.You want to get even more massive,you can think of a kitten.So, a kitten after a couple of weeks,it's still a kitten now, it's
still not a fully grown cat,it'll have a mass of
about 200 to 300 grams.And this makes a rough amount of sense,you can imagine this
thing having the same massas maybe 10 or 15 of
these little field mice.You can imagine the
mouse is about that size,right over there.I could do a better job drawing a mouse.But that makes some sense.So what if we get even larger?What if we get into the
ranges of, say, 1000 grams?Well, now we can start
talking about kilograms.And just to be clear,
when I put a "g" here,that's just an abbreviation for "gram."So this is 1 gram, 5 grams, 20 grams.And now, if you want to go to 1000 grams,you could think of something likea hard-cover textbook like this one.And they're obviously,
some textbooks are huge,but the one that I'm showing hereI didn't weigh or figure out
the mass of this exact one.But it would have a mass of roughly1 kilogram, or 1000 grams.So that's a kilogram right
over there, 1000 grams.A fully grown cat, that's
about 3 to 5 kilograms,depending on how fully grown it isor I guess how big of a cat it is.So, that's pretty
interesting, a fully grown catis more than 10 times
the mass of a kitten.Actually that makes sense,
most fully grown humansare more than 10 times their masswhen they were very, very young,or actually roughly 10
times the mass of whenthey were very young, so
it actually makes sense.Now, if you want to get even larger,you can go to a large
ape, like a human being,in particular, this one right over here.70 kilograms, and this is actuallypretty close to my actual
mass, 70 kilograms.And you get a sense of
what that would meanif you're used to dealing with pounds.I weigh a little over 160 pounds,so that's about 70 kilograms.Or 1 kilogram is roughly 2.2 poundsif you are used to thinking
in terms of pounds.But, once again, pounds
are a unit of weight,while kilograms are a unit of mass.And then, if you want to get even heavier,you would get 10 times more massivethan a human being, than a
normal-sized human being,you might get to something like this cow,and this cow would have
a mass of 750 kilograms.So, how many paper clips would you needto have the same mass as this cow?Well, you might be tempted to say 750,but remember this is 1
gram, this is 750 kilograms.So the mass of this cow
is actually 750,000 grams.So you would need about 750,000 of thesepaper clips to have the
same mass as this cow.
