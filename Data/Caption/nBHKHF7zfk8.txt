in the mail very best lesson on and oneand we look at all the units we said youcould measure lengths which wereone-dimensional you can measure areaswhich are two-dimensional and then youcan measure volumes right so how wouldyou finish the sentence the volume ofthe solid is don't you define that -somebody's never heard the word volumebefore now capacity is a reallyimportant idea however an I should saynow very very closely linked rightcapacity is how much stuff you can fitinside something okay volume is a little- little bit different it's like thedifference between saying okay what arethe dimensions of this box versus howmuch water kind of pouring up so we'regonna look at capacity next week andthey are very crude but slightlydifferent everyone I have another guyyeah yeah okay so capacities about howmuch stuff is in something whereas thevolume of a side is the amount of spaceit takes up and the important thing islength 1 dimensional area 2 dimensionalbut volume is three dimensionalokay which is why we have likecentimeters and meters for length wehave square centimeters and squaremeters for area and then we have cubicmeters and cubic centimeters for homeokay now it's kind of cool because it'snot that complicated to work out if youhave a solid shape like this okay nowthese are kinds of the main ones we'regoing to focus on because you can seeit's kind of the same all the way alongright so if I were to slice this up intopieces it would be trained a whole bunchof triangles right so B then I can cutit up all the way and get the same shapeover every game we call this heading wecall thispresident actually comes from I thinkit's Latin or Greek Latin I think comesfrom the word fault that means cuttingor soaring right so it's like I thinkI'll saw this shape into many manypieces and get the same thing over andover again right so a prism is a summonwhere the way I would say it is aconsistent cross-section if you cut itagain and again and again you get thesame shape repeatedly right so sorrywith consistent cross can you draw thisshape for me I was a bit limited indoing this I did really mean this to meif a triangle rather than like this stepII being but if we draw one of thesethings right and if you have if youdon't have a ruler or a straight edgewell let's draw one togetherand to help you make it feel like aprison right having these dotted linesis helpful because we're using a 2dspace in other words my whiteboard inyour piece of paper we're using a 2dspace to represent a 3d object soeverything you can do like shading extralines you can't really see to help youfeel like yes this is a 3d object themore you've got a boast about now if youhave another color there it will bereally useful because what I want tohighlight for you is this consistentcross-section idea right so if I wouldhave cut this say in here so just eyesup for a second and watch where I'mplacing us you can see the beginning isa triangle and the end is a triangle andeverywhere in between like here forinstance all of those are also trianglesokay so we name prisms based on whattheir cross-section is right so this iswell what would you call this ourtriangular prism you can have a squareprism you can have a rectangular prismso long as you've got straight edgeseverywhere and you can cut it across andget this consistent cross section it's aprism okay now how do you go aheadworking out the volume of this thingright all it means is how much spacedoes it take how much space is it takeso I want to take advantage of thiscross section idea okay if what I do iscut this up many many times so that I'vegot all of the different pieces rightyou can see every time I break thisapart I'm going to get that sametriangle over and over again so justneed to know how many of those trianglesI've got so let's actually uh let'sactually use this will borrow themeasurements of this thing right you cansee what are they um if you treat onecube as a unit right how tall inhalewide or what are the base of my heightof my triangle it's three and threeright so let's just say three over hereor three over here okay you might liketo put some arrows here to indicatewhat's going on so I can work out everysingle one of these and I'm going tobreak this apart a second every singleone of these triangles has the samethree by three dimension okay andthere's a for meconveniently there's a right angle thereso we'll use that in a minute how manyof these triangles do I have what is thethe distance all the way across thetrailers it's 4 right so I'm gonna putmy form now this is a little bit weirdright we're gonna work out the area ofeach one of these triangles and so wecall this a the cross-sectional area wecall it a now makes sense and calculateit in a secondbut this other distance right this forwhat might we call it now depending onthe way you hold it you will call itdifferent things so for example if Ihold it like this so that the this forlength is facing from me to you right orfrom you to me you'd probably call itsomething like depthmaybe it's like how deep does it go inokay however our convention is that wetry and think of the object upright likethis okay so we call this thingjust like in a triangle you don't haveto draw this but just like in a triangleyou see how this is not just the heightit's that perpendicular height so whywhat is the height that's perpendicularto my cross-section so I'm going tothink of it as very like this and callthis perpendicular height so since it'sfine I'll just use the letter H okay nowthat's a bit weird because it's like youknow if I look at it like this itdoesn't seem normal to call thatdistance which is horizontal to callthat height right um you wouldn't callthe width between my my shoulders rightyou wouldn't call that my height but hiit shapes like this it's kind of a moremalleable idea I can turn this shapearound and measure it in different waysas opposed to me which you can't turn itaround we probably could because I'm notheavy but anyway you get the idea thenthis is what we got a call edge okay soum can we work out what the area is infact could you use this as something tohelp you what's the area of a triangleit's 1/2 base times higher right nowjust using these measurements base timesheight is 9 and so half of base timesheight is now let's just imagine if Ihad to use this as my model right butlet's imagine that the units are incentimeters okay so this length iscentimeters centimeters and Centervideos so what units are thecross-sectional area movies across verygood square centimeters I've alreadywe've already described what aperpendicular height here is okay sotherefore just need a tiny bit of spacethe volume which again we're going toabbreviate just the single better thisis a good choice the volume is going tobe the cross-sectional area times theperpendicularlook you just get a whole bunch of thesejust tell me how many of them there onthe answer is for them so I'm gonna saya H four times four and a half hmm fourtimes four huhI think that's 18 now remember I pointedout to you what these units were inright it's important you always havebeen skipper measuring stuff centimetersquared centimeters you put themtogether centimeters cubed this is justlike your next Lord's as it is like ifyou had two squared times two you'd havetwo cute right you've got centimeterssquared times centimeters you're gettingcentimeters cube it's not a coincidence
