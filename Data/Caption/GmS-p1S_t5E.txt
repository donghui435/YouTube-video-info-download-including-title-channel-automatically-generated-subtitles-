when our two triangles said to becongruent consider these two triangleseach triangle has three sides and threeanglessix elements in all let's name thetriangles first we call the firsttriangle ABC and the second one PQ ourside a B is congruent to side PQ side BCis congruent to side Q R and side AC iscongruent to side PR each of the threesides of triangle ABC is congruent tothe three sides of triangle PQR angle ais congruent to angle P angle B iscongruent to angle Q and angle C iscongruent to angle R then we can saythat triangle ABC is congruent totriangle PQR we use this sign to denotecongruence a squiggly line above theequal to sign so we don't really need toplace one figure on the other to know ifthey are congruent when we know thatcorresponding sides and angles are equalthere are two important questions weneed to address first what on earth doescorresponding mean and second do we needto compare all six elements of each ofthe triangles to know if they'recongruent we will address both thesequestions in the coming videos
