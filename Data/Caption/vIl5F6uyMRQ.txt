what is this even for sure you aredrowning this Hey don't bother me I canprotect myself all right good job okayso let's do this I'm happy because the45-45-90 triangle 4545 triangle is oneof the most important lessons in all ofgeometry it's on the SAT a lot so muchso that they give you an example of a45-45-90 at the beginning of every mathsection which is pretty interesting butthey said she does that they'rebasically saying you have to know thiscoming in because if you look at thepicture for example this is the futurewith my crazy love yeahthat again this is the picture they giveyou okay so I know some of you have donea lesson like this beforebut if you don't know what that meansit's kind of nonsense that's what theygive you on the beginning of SAT sowe're gonna talk about that we're gonnauncover it okay so let's just do itready ready class gene up so I guesswe'll start okay so let's say you have atriangle and we'll draw one that's toobad and now my triangle is wackokay first of all who knows why why it'scalled the 45-45-90 triangle pleasealmost say better watch your side so twox's or the more than ninety degrees theshort leg around you're getting it Iknow you know let's hear it two anglesall right so you have the right idea 4545okay so first let's classify thistriangle what type of triangle is thisyes right triangle correct what whatother type of triangle is it yes it isisosceles very good so my stassi'striangle has two or more equal whatsides and two or more congruent anglesas well Ohso this says two congruent angles and sowhat do you know about which sides aregoing to be congruent which x we cangrow in your piece yes the ones oppositethe ones opposite angles and in effectyou also know that the hypotenuse isgoing to be longer than thethese are called legs and hypotenuse isgoing to be longer all right so that's areally easy component of a 45-45-90triangle is that the legs are always thesame the legs are always the sameokay no matter what so now let's gothrough itlet's say this was three and three andlet's say we didn't know anything abouta 45-45-90 triangle we could still solvefor this hypotenuse using what yesPythagorean theorem is right okay solet's go ahead and do it I know you knowthis so let's go through it a squaredplus B squared equals C squaredwhat's a right a squared is nine I'mdown for that nine plus nine threesquared plus three squared equals Csquared C squared equals 18 square rootboth sides is 18 a perfect squareyeah no you split it into two numbersand which one is a perfect square inthis case nine and two so the squareroot of 9 is 3good 3 square root key - okay so we canput that in 3 okay now can anyone see alink between the legs and the hypotenuseyes all rightso pretty much the height only 45-45-90triangle the hypotenuse yeah always adda rad - I'm so it could be like thelights to be like 500 needs to be fiverad five ransom okay that's the firstmajor rule yes because all of them areacts so yeah that's what this picture isreferring to exactly this picture issaying okay dude scuse mewhatever the leg is though this leg isthe same like five and five or percentand this would be five rad - okay solet's try some examples in other wordswe don't necessarily need to doevery time once you know it's a 45-45-90all right so I'm going to erase this Iwant to know I don't want to disrespectOh make it look likealright so 45-45-90 give in and let'ssay this was ten fill er up yes thatone's 10 - yep ten times square - okaylet's make it more challenging there wego 45-45-90 again now we're gonna saythis is the square root of six now we'regetting somewhereokay so what's the best place to starton a 45-45-90 like that's easy you knowyeah please the other leg is going to bethe same right keep that in mind alwaysother legs going to be the same root 6and you sir in the back said you add asquare root of 2 right what is it reallyare we adding a square root of 2 ormultiplying very good we're multiplyingthe leg times the square root of 2 sowhat is the square root of 6 times thesquare root of 2 yes square root of 12is that enough though no no can we skiplafazanisyes right okay so you're splitting the12 in two times 3 so this is 2 root 3very good let's say you weren't sureabout whether or not this was the righthypotenuse what could you always do whatcould you check yeahothers two times three is six knots ofcoincidence that's a coincidencehow can you check whether these legs andthe hypotenuse are correct in the samecorrect relationship you actually saidit before how do you check this stuffyeah yeah you can check with patheticright let's do that really quicka squared would be what what squared issix squared there's six what's the rulewhen you square a square root very goodplus six again equals to root 3 squaredC squared let's do this two squared orsquare root of three squared we needthree so these two are the same so we'regood okay so that's how to check okaylet's make it more challenging if Icould I would roll up my sleeves but Ican't yes there's no room in this thing45 45 okay now here we gowhat do we do nowyou
