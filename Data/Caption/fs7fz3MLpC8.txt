Determine whether the
statement is always,sometimes, or never true,
and explain why.The statement here is b squared
plus b minus 2, all ofthat over b plus 2 is equal
to b minus 1 for allreal numbers b.Well one thing that just jumps
out at you before you even tryto manipulate this algebraically
is that I canthink of a b value where this
left expression won't be equalto b minus 1.A b value that will make this
left expression undefined.And it becomes undefined if this
denominator becomes 0.And the way the denominator is
going to become 0 is if b isnegative 2.So let's write that down.If b is equal to negative 2,
then b squared plus b minus 2over b plus 2, what
does that become?It equals-- b squared would be 4
minus 2 minus 2, which wouldbe 0/0, which is undefined.It's not equal to-- let me
write this this way.It's not equal to b minus 1,
which is-- negative 2 minus 1,negative 3.When you put negative 2 in here,
on the left-hand side,it doesn't evaluate
to negative 3.It evaluates to 0/0,
which is undefined.So we already found an example
of a b where this is not true.So it's definitely not always
going to be true.We found a case.Now, let's algebraically
manipulate this and see ifit's true for pretty much
any other number.So let's see if we can maybe
factor the numerator up there.So b squared plus b minus 2.If you think about it, two
numbers when you take theirproduct is negative 2, and when
you add them you get 1.Well, that's going to be
positive 2 and negative 1.So the numerator we can
rewrite as b plus 2times b minus 1.And then the denominator
is b plus 2.Well we can just leave
it like that.Let's just work on the
left-hand side.Now, if we assume that b is not
equal to negative 2, thenb plus 2 divided by b plus
2 is well defined.It is 1.As long as it's not
0/0 it will be 1.And so this expression is the
same thing as b minus 1 if weassume that b is not equal
to negative 2.So if you assume that b is not
equal to negative 2, thisthing over here does indeed
equal b minus 1.So it is true for all of the
other real numbers except fornegative 2.So this is sometimes true.It's true every time except for
the case where b is equalto negative 2.And you can even try it
with some number here.Try it with 0.If I were to do 0 squared plus 0
minus 2, you get negative 2.Over 0 plus 2 is 2.And then that does indeed
equal negative 1.So it works with 0,
it works with 1.It'll work with any number
other than b is equal tonegative 2.
