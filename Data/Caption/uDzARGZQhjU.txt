now I'm going to show you a fewdifferent ways to find this becausethere there are sort of different casesfor it okay so just as an example let'simagine there are seven people in yourgroup in your population or your Senatesample or whatever it is and you want towork out what are all the quartilesin this set of data okay now be reallyhelpful if you have a couple of colorsthe first thing you do is you find themedian right that's the easiest to findand we're all really knowing how to findit so it's a good starting point okaycan someone remind me how do I find themedian in an open set of scores I've gottwo ways okay number one I can just sortof climb from the bottom and from thetop and eventually I will be in themiddle okay does that make sensewhat was my other way of doing it myquicker way yeah very goodso I've conveniently named the scoresafter how many there areso n7 I'm going to add one chance todayhey and then I divide by two which getsme to before okay so let's all labelthis guy here right we already knowthat's Q to the median now with yourother colors there I want you to noticehave a look at the rest of the datayou've got the same number scores belowthe median as you do above the medianright so what you put up I want you toread it it's like oh I've got a wholenew set of scores over here and thislittle set of scores has its own mediandoes that make sensedo you have a look at these three and Imean Costa very low three what's themedian in this little corner of theworld it's two right so this guy herehe's going to be the first quartile andyou rehearse it again for your upper setof data and you are our six is in themiddle so that's your upper quartile sothis is the lower one and this is theupper onenow to know whether you got it right ornot all you have to do is come back towhat quartile is just remember thedefinition and see if it was successfulhave a look have we divided up thedialogue into four equal sections havewe done that yeah we have right look heis the data below q1 he's the Dharmabetween q1 q2 the one between q3 and q4and here's what's above does that makesense so this is not challenging butthis is nice and neat this is whereeverything lands particularly neatly onnumbers so right another example for meunder movies let's just add a score alsobefore we start doing this we found thequartiles but I haven't actuallycalculated the interquartile range howabout what's the last step that's Missyit's the easiest step actually yeah yeahI just I just take the difference rightso maybe on the right hand side here youwon't actually calculate theinterquartile range is the upperquartile take away the lower quartileyou don't have to keep on writing thiswe can use the abbreviation upper takeaway lower in this case you can see I'vecircled them in black so it's 6 takeaway 2 and that gives you the actualinterquartile range okay now by the waycan you notice right see how I've got um1 2 3 4 5 6 7 I could have made this guyover here this 7 I couldn't made it like100 right making a huge outlier therange will change but the inter quartilerange will stay the same so it's kind oflike trying to avoid this uh problemhere you like big deal the interquartilerange is cool all right all right let'shave a look again let's go through thisand try and work out each of theindividual pieces right firstly but whenwe start which port on to be fine firstq2 because the middle ones always theeasiest to spot so you have a look againcan we do it the quick way that's liketry and practice it how many turns on it8so you add one which gets you to ninenine divided by two is four and a halfso that means here's the fourth andfifth terms right so I'm going to say Iused a red didn't I I'm going to sayright in here right for 45 that's themedian huge soon and then what did i dofrom here to get to the rest of the yeahI remember I imagined hey look I haveseparated using the median the dot intotwo different chunks and I'm going totreat them one pump three times I'mgoing to treat each of them as kind ofit's into its own population right okayso what's the median down here okay sothey're between two and three so twopoint five so that is q1 and I'm gonnarow has the same thing over yeah sixpoint five that's cube okay so you cansee sometimes the numbers all of yourquarters will land on some of the scoresjust like the meeting sometimes itdoesn't it lands all between now we didit for seven scores we did it for eightscores I'd like you without me holdingyour hand could you do it for ninescores and for ten scores as well justdo that as example3 example4 I want youto see if you can do it on your ownsteam and then we'll share our resultsin a minutehave a go okay consult me through let'sdo the third one with nine scoresinstead of seven point eight what are wegoing to go to first where are welooking we're going to go right to themiddle okay so cute is the easiest tospot so I'm going turn I like that guyokay now what's the thought process I gothrough to find out what the other twoquantizedyeah good by the way can I just umemphasize like you see how I underliethese in black rightit's important that you work out whatare you finding the median old forexample how do you look at this onethere's obvious for this one how do youlook at this one it matters whether yousay this is where you're finding themedian or whether you include the fiveor not okaydo you include the five or do you leaveit aside and just say well there arefour scores just think about that for asecond before I answer that question howwould you be able to tell whether youinclude the file or not keep that keepthat thought in your head let's let'sfind what they are under this schemewhat's the young what do you reckon q1is this case and q3okay cool okay now how am I going towork out whether I did this right or notapart from of course look at the backwe'll call relying on a teacher to tellyou yeah fantastic so I want to look ateach of these spots each of thesedividers and see were they successful inmaking sure that there's equal arm equalnumbers between each of themand it works doesn't it look you've gottwo scores here are the two scores inbetween two and three - s'mores betweenI can see you get the idea right now canyou imagine don't don't write thisbecause it's going to be wrong imagineif I did included the fire does thatmean if you'd included the fire likethis okay we already know okay this guyis done so he's cute too if I includedthe five which score is which whichtrees which score is q1 which was k3what's q1 on this on this scheme ofdoing it it's gonna be the three rightand which one is q3if I include the five again it's gonnabe the seven right but do you see theproblem do you see what's emerge rightlook Oh again I'll do the count okay Iown to the left of q1 and how manyscores do I see I see wanted tothen I look between q1 and q2 and howmany scores do I see between thequartiles there's only one swarm rightit's just the four do you see that rightand then again there's only one scorehere and you've got two scores of it soit's a symmetrical but they're notquarters you haven't divided up intofour equal sections okay so that's howyou do it like I always like I struggleto remember and I actually when I learntthem I just learnt as a random rule thatyou don't include you too becausebecause the texture it's home he notsaying clickety but this is the reasonwhy like you've got to make sure theyare actually quartiles and there's fourequal sections okay you wanna maybe skipand just tell me which one's q1 q2 andq3 are for this last set yeah threethat's nice and easy because you can seethere's an odd number of it andfantastic okay so you can make hang ofit these four examples they're all theones you need to do because if you dothe next one how old do you see this apattern to use a pattern this first onethe court allows all land on scorestwo four six yeah have a look at thisone when the quartiles land always inbetween they're all they're all hearthave a look at this one you've got themiddle one on a score and then outsideof scores then here you've got inbetween scores and all scores your nextone what's going to happen to which oneof these will it be if you've got elevenscores all of them are going to landyou're going to be back in thissituation do you see ever one of theways you know is from seven stores toeleven scores right you've added on fourscores right so it's just like slightlyand see how I've got one two three fourone in each quartile well you're justgonna have one extra one so each onethat's itokay so these for all the differentkinds of ways you've got quartiles justdraw them out there are four videos youcan work out like you know how we did nplus 1 or 2 there's other ones which golike in 2n plus 3 on 4 it gets a bitconfusing and peoplethe role so I think writing the scoresout isn't much simple okay how manyquestions yes yes so we're going to lookat box and whisker plots we're going tobe drawing a lot of them tomorrow and Ihave also forgotten to actuallycalculate the interquartile range foreach one can you just quickly tell mewhat's the ratio okay so there there'sfour here five it's spaced out and herealso five okay good so the box andwhisker plot is going to take in a waterschool so it'll put a line there ittakes each of these quartiles and put abox around them and then it takes yourhighest score like this and that's whatmakes your whiskers but we're going tospend a bit more time in that tomorrowokay that's all it is to a bottom - ohby the way like these these these thingshere they also called these five numbersthey call the five number summary orfive-point summary of a set of scores soyou'll hear that phrase sometimetomorrow okay
