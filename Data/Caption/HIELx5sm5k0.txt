here's an ice cream actually we have theice cream on the top and this is calledthe cone and it's one of thethree-dimensional shapes we will look atit looks something like this and wheninverted will look like this wheneveryou see a three-dimensional figure youjust have to ask yourself two questionswhat is the figure made of and how is itdefined the cone has one circular baseand a slant curved surface the slantcurved surface begins at the vertex andgrows towards the base the next thing weneed to know is how a cone is defined acone is defined by two parameters firstits height and second the radius of itscircular base this length will be theheight and this length will be theradius of the circular base so if boththese parameters are given we will get aunique cone what does this mean say youare asked to draw a cone which has theradius of its circular base fivecentimeters so you draw it like thiswell some of you may draw it like thisor maybe like this the radius of thecircular base is the same in each casebut to define it uniquely we need theheight tonow let's analyze an inverted cone if wetake the circular base out we will beleft with a hollow open cone now if wetear open the corn vertically from thevertex this is how it will look and nowif we just open this up a bit more thisis how it will look and guess what thisis it is a sector of a circle so thecurved surface of a cone when opened uplooks like a sector of a circle
