what's up 5th graders my name is Anthonythanks again for stopping by here atmash up math this is gonna be a shortlesson where we get to apply ourproblem-solving skills to a questionthat was inspired by some of thosereleased Common Core test questions itis aligned with the Common Core learningstandards for fifth grade math let'slet's go ahead and get started well it'sup to all the fifth grade students outthere Anthony here and thank you thankyou for stopping by and joining me onthis problem but we have four streetartists who were asked to paint 1/5 of awall mural and they are dividing thesection to be painted equally among thefour artists and our task here is tofind what fraction of the entire wallmural did each artist decorate so let'sstop take a breath hmm and ask ourselveshow can we model this situation we don'thave a diagram here but if we can drawone we can better wrap our head aroundwhat's going on here so we want to takewhat's in our head our thinking and putit down on paper so let's start off byimagining our wall which we are going topaint a mural on and these four artistsare only painting one-fifth of the muralso we split the wall up into five equalsections and four of those sections areoff-limits we only care about one fifthof the whole muralnow out of that one fifth before artistsare dividing it equally amongst them sowe want to cut that one fifth sectioninto four equal partsso each of the four artists isdecorating their own sectionso now that we can better visualizewhat's going on let's revisit thequestion what fraction of the entirewall mural dideach artist decorate so what fraction ofthe whole thing is that one section sowe can think of a fraction as thenumerator representing the part and thedenominator representing the whole thingnow the part is that one little greensection and the whole thing will be howmany of those little green sectionswould make up the entire mural now wecan figure that out by cutting each ofthose 1/5 sections into fourths like wedid with the first one and then countinghow many make up the entire thing doingit this way gives us a total of 20 so weknow that each artist decorated onetwentieth of the entire wall mural hahacool and this should make sense becausethat 1/4 was multiplied by each 1/5section of the entire muralwhen we multiply fractions together withyour numerator times numerator in thiscase 1 times 1 which just equals 1 andthen denominator by denominator in thiscase 4 times 5 which equals 20 and ourresulting fraction is 1 over 20 so wecan conclude that each artist paintedone twentieth of the mural so that wasmore of a visual approach to thinkingabout how we can model scenarios thatinvolve multiplying fractions togetherand understanding both ways will giveyou a more complete understanding ofworking with fractions and we're donewith that question so thank you again somuch for stopping by you guys are thebest I really do appreciate it and I'llsee you all next time see ya thanksagain for stopping by please click thelink below and subscribe to our YouTubechannel we'll catch you next time youknow it see ya
