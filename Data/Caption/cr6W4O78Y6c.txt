this is harder to show my students thewhy we need a chain rule in this video Iwill show you how to conduct a review ofthe function square root of 3x plus 1and I will show it guess two ways to dothis the first way is that we'll beusing the definition of derivative andthe second is that we'll be using theshortcuts namely the power rule andthat's pretty much everybody's favoritemethod right by in this case we alsohave to talk about the chain rule andyou will see why the chain rule mattersbut anyway let's focus on interventionof derivative first so right here we'regiven f of X is go to this therefore bydefinition let me write down F prime ofX this is for the derivative this by thePhoenicians is the limit as H goes tozero and we have to remember what goeson right here right here right so thisis f of X plus h minus f of X all over Hnamely a difference quotient and now wejust have to figure this out and justpretty much do the algebra for here tosee what we get to continue we get thelimit and yes you have to just writedown this as many times as we need toanyway here f of X plus h this X plus his our new input all I'll have to do isto plug in this into this X that'spretty much it so for this part we willhave the square root and then you havethis 3 right here but instead of this Xyou open a parenthesis and put down Xplus h so we put down appendixes X plush right here and then close that westill have the plus what after that sothat's it for that first part and then uminus f of X which is just that so it'sjust right down square root of 3x plus 1everything over that H so this is theset up and now we just have to do somealgebra from here to see if we end upwith a nice expression or not okaywhat can we do thoughwell if you just plug in zero into allthe age let me tell you you enter with azero over zero situation we must do somealgebra and some cancellation willhappen you'll see hmm when we havesquare roots what's the best thing forus to do I said to that is just thecountry get right and the country curvethis is just that we will multiply thetime and pattern instead of this - herewe would keep this and now the same Ichange that to a plus so let me justmultiply by square root and of coursenotice that here we have the street infront of this parenthesis we should justmultiply this a so for this right herelet me just write it down as 3x plus 3hand then you still have the plus one andinstead of the minors you have to have aplus for the count you get and then thisstates the same again 3x plus one sothat's the count you get and you do iton the top you do it on the bottom aswell so let me just put this down 3xplus 3h plus 1 and then plus square rootof 3x plus 1 like this and you just haveto do some algebra from here hmm whatcan we dothe beauty of using the conjugates thatthis is in the 4th a minus B times aplus B there's a nice formula for us touse to simplify this any me write thisdownwhenever we have a minus B and then weare trying to multiply this with a plusB this right here you just do a squareand then you minus B squared that's alland you will see it's really niceso from here let me just focus on thetop this is equal to the limit as H goesto 0 on the top once again this is the abut you just have to square that andwhenever you have the square root yousquare that you just pretty much cancelthem out the square root and squarecancel each other out so in other workyouhave the inside right here first rightand this inside is the same as thisinside and then we just put that down 3xplus 3h plus 1 so that's the first partthis time I'll just put on parenthesesno more square root and this is like thea square part and next you - the secondpart is P Square which is this thingsquaredonce again square square root n salt youjust have the inside I will just writedown 3x plus 1 so that's the top andhere is something you should keep inmind the reason I were using conjugateis to fix the top right and we multiplythe out this is what we have ready andthe country guard on the bottom we arenot going to multiply the out becauseyou will see good things will happen ina minute so I would just write this downas howdy is H times the parenthesissquare root of 3x plus 3h plus 1 andthen plus square root of 3x plus 1 wellwe just have to fix the top a little bitmore notice you can just distribute thisinto the apprentices so you get prettymuch 3x plus 3h plus 1 minus 3 X andthen minus 1 and muffins 3x minus 3xof course they become 0 likewise 1 minus1 it's also 0 so we pretty much have 3hon the top and on the bottom you noticethat you do have this H and H you cancatch all the out so depends if you wantto write this down k1 now we can justcancel the H try here okay I will dothat for you guys I'm going to cross outthis H with diet so this is pretty muchthe simplification in the end we seethat this is nothing but just the limitas H goes to 0 on the top you just havethis result ok and then this H is alsogone so we just write this down squareroot of 3x plus 3h plus 1 and then plussquare root of 3x plus 1and notice this and that when they kissout in fact you can solve this throughover zero situation and that's sowonderful because now you can just plugin this 0 into this H and get the niceanswer so I'll show you guys the workfor that you get 3 over this is squareroot of 3 X plus 3 times you run out andthen you add 1 and then you add this oneagain put your square root of 3x plus 1and you see that on the top is 3 overnotice this 3 times 0 is 0 so you prettymuch have square root of 3x plus 1 plusanother 1/2 of this and they are thesame inside so of course we can combinethem in fact you get just 2 square rootof 3x plus 1 and this is the answer andnotice when I plug in the 0 into thisage I didn't write down limit because Itook the limit already this is thecomputational part for that and this isthe final answer namely we get 3 over 2square root of 3x plus 1 and that's thederivative of this function so this isthe cool definition of derivative andnow let's talk about how we can possiblydo it in your shorter way so let mewrite this down again this is f of Xequals 2 almost always okaykeep this in mind in calculus you almostalways look at the square root as 1/2power so I will just write that time foryou guys in other word f of X is equalto parenthesis 3x plus 1 inside raisedto the 1/2 powerwhy because when you have the power formyou can use the power rule everybody'sfavorite method right well do this onereally carefully first of all let mejust write down F prime of X for thederivative right here I will just circlethe power and bring that to the front soyou just have the 1/2 and then theinside stays to sayX plus one so you bring the power to thefront and then you have to - that powerright here this is going to give you thenew power so 1/2 minus 1 this isnegative 1/2 now and let me just putthis down for you guys to see whathappensthis is raised to the negative 1/2 powerin other word we can bring this down tothe denominator and this will join thesetwo in the denominator so we have 3xplus 1 and then the 1 hat becomespositive and then you can of course trythis back as a square root so this isjust 1 over 2 and this becomes a squareroot of this 3x plus 1 and you see yes Iused it the power rule and this is theanswer that I got for the derivative butwhat happens what's wrong well this iscertainly not the same as this andwhat's the difference yes on the tophere I have 1 but by using thedefinition of derivative we saw thatthis ratio has been history right Idon't think we make any mistake so thisis the time that you have to rememberand this is hard to point out the chainrule situation with my students imagineyou just do the power rule which we didhow in the world can we multiply by thestreets legitimate and the answer tothat is we had to stick derivativenotice this 3 is pretty much thederivative the inside you see the insidehere derivative of 3x plus 1 isprecisely these 3 so what you do thepower rule is I want you to write hereis that after you to the power rule yougo to the inside function and then youask yourself what's at the root of theinside function which is just a 3 soafter you do the power rule at the endright here you multiply by the root ofthis which is 3 and of course you justmaking that in the end you see 1 times 3you actually end up with the jetty - 3which is the answer that we are supposedlaughs this is it of course everybodywill say this is much nicer easierfaster quicker whatever but this is theyou know the king with a crane calleddieter of you by anyway hopefully youguys like this video and this is onceonce again I this is harder to show mystudents that why we need a chain rulethis is my my way - it's true - is thechamber concept so if I use the shortcutit's okay but be sure you - a cavity andif you are doing the test questionwhatsoever if the test question isasking you to use the definition ofderivative be sure you do something likethis anyway that's it and if you're newto my channel please subscribe I like tomake these videos for you guys[Music]
