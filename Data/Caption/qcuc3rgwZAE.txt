Okay so today we're going to talk about blockchain technologyand give you a high-level overview of what it is and how it worksblockchain, it emerged in 2008 out of cryptocurrencyspecifically Bitcoin that had a white paper published andThat's really where it all startedSo we start, I guess, by defining what it isBlockchain technology is a distributed, decentralized system in which all partieshave an entire record and can view the transactions that took placeIt's a decentralized and distributed network andI can draw that out to explain what a decentralized, distributed network actually isso in a classic centralized network, you have a central node to which all othernodes in the network connect toIn a distributed systemyou might haveclusters of nodes with a fewlinks between them, something a bit like thisBut if you know - this node - is knocked offline, you losethe part of the data that was stored on that systemin a distributed systemlike a peer-to-peer networkyou have something a bit more like thishere you can think of talking a bit like in database termsyour database is sharded anddistributed in components, parts across your networkIn this distributed, decentralized solutionall parties have a complete record of the database and systemcombined together to add this one single database with each individual node having a completecopy of all transactions, in the case of blockchainSo here you've got centralized,here you've got a decentralized networkwhere you've got clusters with only a few nodes connecting the individual clustersand here in this more lattice pattern you've got adistributed and decentralized networkyou can think of the blockchain system as a distributed ledger or like an old fashionuh, database term, a transaction based databaseThat's what it fundamentally is, it stores a ledger of transactionsuhandit's alsoimmutable, which is to say..it can be updatednew sets of transactions can be added to itbut, it can't, you know, once something's added, that block cannot and should not be changed ormutated any furtherthe core technologies that underpin blockchainis hash codes, hash puzzlesMerkel trees and public-private key cryptographyin the sort of common parlance of bitcoin you have what is known as a bitcoin walletthat's actually your public key in [terms of your?] private-public key cryptography[like an?] earlier Computerphile on public-private encryptionbut essentially, in the case of blockchain, you have your your wallet (your public key) anduhyour private keyand an interesting thing about at least the way bitcoin has implemented on the blockchain technologyit's all or nothing, so the total wealth of my current wallet has to be spent in a transaction, so if I've got fivebitcoins using the Bitcoin technologyand I only want to send one to you then I send one coin to you and four back to myselfbut I had to do this sort of circular transactionI basically say that that one bitcoin I've sent to youisI don't necessarily know you, I don't know who you areThere's no reason for us to have met orme to even know your name what I'm really saying is the wallet that is labeledby this public key, the person who owns the corresponding private key to that public keyI'm authorizing them to take ownership ofthis one Bitcoinand that's how public private key Encryption is used in, in means oflegitimizing and, or uhauthoring transaction said yesI have said you can spend this amountI wish transfer the amount to you, and you know that that turns got originated from meand not somebody else on the network poking at meThe other thing is hash uhHash codes and merkel trees
Basically I can, please throw this out,another interesting thing about the way hashes work is for a given inputif I have I knowABC make my input and I put that through hashing algorithms andI get the output, I don't know, uhZero Five B CUhI only have to change this marginally, say I add ABCand I add D to it and it will completely change the corresponding hashed codeyou only have to change the input in a small way to get a drastically different hashcode coming outthat will be of the same uniform length, a particular one despite the fact the input which of a different lengthyou can think of it is like labeling it with a uhI'm going to use 'unique' carefully here 'cause there areIn occasions you do hash collisions where?different input resolves to the same hash, but you're you're aiming toward uniquenessand the idea is you can think of it as like afixed length signature for a given inputso how this feature further in in block Chains isa blockchain technologyThe transactions we talked about earlieruh, are grouped to get, you know, you can think of transactions when they firstpublished the network it's existing out there in the etherand then the job of you might have heard of sort of miners in blockchain technologyThe job of a miner is to gather a bunch of these two transactions togetherform them into a block andthe process of doing that is what involves hashingand the process of checking that a block it remains immutable and hasn't been changedIt goes on to Merkle trees which are drawn in the next diagram, but essentially one key. I formed my blockMy block has a corresponding hashcodeand how Merkle trees come into it.
If we start with abasic block of content that we want to represent in our tree structure in generating ournext node in our tree. I'm just going to use H to represent hash functionOf A and B, and the value of that comes to label this node in our treeLikewise over here, take the Hash of Band C and then here at our top level we take the hash ofthe hash of A and B, and the hash of B and Cand thatrepresents our next level up in the tree andthe interesting thing aboutThis structure and about hash code is, we remember from this diagramYou only have to change your input a tiny bit to change the output so if I change this base contentI make it lower case rather than upper case for examplethis will then change to this, the hashcode will become invalidas wic and it will persuade and filter back up andthat is the coreof blockchain technology in terms of how blocks are stored and how it's, uh,In a, in a sys-, in a distributed system when no one knows anybody elsehow you know and can be certain thatthe transaction cannot been tampered with because everyone can see this chain of blocksHaving talked about some the underlying data structuresgive an example of how transaction get grouped into blocks and blocks get grouped into chainsso you can think of, uhyour, you knowyour ledger of transactions, you can, when you transaction your first formed on the networkthey could go out there in the ether; the sort of loosetransactions that need to be grouped together into blocksin a networkAnyone who takes on the role of a miner their job is to grab some of thesetransactions down from the ether put them into a blockIf I draw a block here and a block has several things in it hasa set of transactionsA said something to BB said something to C and so and so forthit also has the hash value of any previous blockThat were in the networkGoing back to that Merkle tree structureAdditionally it has something known as a Nonce valueWhich is just a randomly guessed value, uhto impact thesignature hash of this blockso you hash the combination of the record of transactions, the hash value of the previous block andthis Nonce value to generate aHash Code that uniquely labels this blocknow the reason behind the Nonce value isto sort of hash puzzle this final hash code that labels this blockIt will [? help out you know ?]it had to start with four zeroesSo what a miner does, he groups his transactions togetherAnd he puts in random guesses for that Nonce value until this hash value that labels this blocksatisfies the Criteria of whatever the hash puzzle iswhere does this hash puzzle come, your said..So its part of the mathematics of the the Block chain Network and it's a way of, uh,certifying thata grou-, a block is legitimateuhand that it's agreed upon key, and it's a way ofmanaging the distributed nature of the network because anyone cantake any collection of transactions very light that are sort of out in the open that not yet formed into a block andTry and create a block and there's this sort of mathematical race of a sort of compute powerTo solve this puzzle and the first person who solves it or the first group of people that solve itThey're the ones that generate a block that goes on to the chainso it's a way of managing the fact that everybody is free to try and create blocks to add to the chainso what happens then whensay two peopleBoth happen to solve a block at the same moment at precisely the same moment nowit is rare, but they happen and in those instancesYou can get forks in block chains. The people in the network, they see one block addedgo off and try and buildBlocks on top of that block whereas the people that see a different block being added go off and try and continue the chain in another directionHow's that yelled across the network? How is it that everyone has this single agreed upon ledger? What happens isThat the longer essentially a sort of a democracy throughout the network, [but] the longest chain is the one that everyone agreesthat they should take and the mathematics are such but you're unlikely to sustainForks for a long period of timeasYou know people are looking all the time to update their current ledger to the longest chainyou know suppose, to keep it simple, we have five people in our network and we have a forked chain. We have twoimagine we [have] two competing chains it only takesthree of those out of five to have seenthe you know the longer of the two chainsfor the vets bit contention submissivelyBishop by Majority vote yetwereWe're going to reject any chain that shorter than the longest chain the majority [of] the people on the network I've seen what happens toAny transactions that happens with the shortage only man. You know in the shorter chains. That's where you're kind of your transactionsYou're in that group. You're out of luck they go [into] the extent that they go back into the ether. They're not yetcodified allureIncorporated into the blockchain and so not process not not legitimate all of thisMeans is actually a slow assistance onat the momentNot as well this will it take it happening very quickly at the moment blocks areinAgain, I use bitcoin cuz you tweak the first systemAnd you know one of the most widely adopted in the bitcoin system lock your created that [the] mathematical complexity of that hash puzzleIs on a sliding scale to reflect the compute power of the network at any given point?That blot will be created on average every 10 minutes the further backIn the chain a particular blockage the less likely it is for that came to beto the plan to be a a shorter fork andDecided so that the currentWaiting period is kailiabefore counting that the money in your walletLet's [fix] plot to be created at a moment. That is back an hourSo it's notInstantaneous, but it's not too long to wait and abad point makes a very slim chance that yourtransactions going to go back into the ether and then you know to be incorporated in a block later on if you are in theUnfortunate circumstance where you were past that shorter fork of the blockchain and your transaction hadn't been acceptedAnd it's been turned back into the ether yeahYou're just wasting for another minor to come along grab that series of transactions you and try and build another blockyou must leave this all these insults and filming about the fact that[there] [is] [going] [to] be a pointer which lonely bitcoin. Go maybeThat's correct. Yes, if some it's like me that this mining will stop at uplandsNo, but how you will be?Complicated with more change so at the momentBitcoins are sort of being introduced to show you through the mining process in that you're being financially rewarded inBitcoin, I think at this point in timethe creation of a block it merits itscoinsin the wallet of the Minor oras is commonly the case now with people grouping computer out together the group of people that are made after sort ofmining poolandAt the point where all of all bitcoins have been introducedYou'll no longer gain financially from mining in that regard how you will thenGain be through transaction feesand he's wherepeople canGive up certain amount of their trank action, okay?I want to send youHe will get a bitcoin I've got five in my county ahead for rather than camping for back to meMaybe I can three and a half back to me, and I k give the other halfto theMinor andduring that way you'll be financially complicated forThe work of of mining so it's a bit like a currency exchange or PayPal little taste their feet dirty noseIs this dislike this distribution if these miners are effectively actually like the ages?affiliation well itto the extent whereyou know that there will be thetransaction page which of them at the MomentYou know should havenotTaking a big part of the network because people are still getting money just from doing the computation work of curing the hash by GeorgeBut as a system evolved and relies more uponTransaction fees then yes. They will book that have more of a role to play within the networkBut they're still likely to beFar below your standardsTransaction fees for exchanging Dalek pounds from its original conception they'll only ever intended and designed to be21 million bitcoins in existence, and you can clearly like to radioactive half-lifecontrolling the release of those we're going and how that's reflected is thelevel of rewards for mining so every and [kitty] every21,000bitcoinsIn the bin the book collection area that have producedThe rewards for mining and creating a block it's aftand show you're introducing half the amount of[ecological] in network if you were previously in Chianti, so forthuntil eventuallyAll 21 million bitcoins have been introduced to the networksame process in reverseUsing the same key and then they get hello back out the other end, and that's nice and simple it works, and it was onceSort of the only way that people did [sing], but it has a problem. Which [is] you both need to know
