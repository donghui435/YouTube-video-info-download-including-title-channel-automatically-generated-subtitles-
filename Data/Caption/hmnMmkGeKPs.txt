Hello, everyone!My name is James,and today I brought you up tothe roof of the Center of Mathematical Sciencesat Cambridge University.I thought it would be quite nice for you to see.They've got some grass up here,we've got some park benches.Today it's a more personal video.It's a bit more bloggy.I'm not a big fan of that, myself.But I go around the countryand I tell people about mathematics,and they ask me"Why do you study mathematics?"And I have to tell them--well, the honest answer,is because I'm lazy!I started studying mathematicsbecause I'm lazy.Mathematics is the perfect subjectfor the lazy student.There's no reading lists,no essays to write.If you turn up to lectures,you can do the homework.If you can do the homework,you can do the exam.It really is just the perfect subject for someone like me.The other reason I studied mathematicsis becausefor me, it's all puzzles and games.And what a great way to make a living!All it is, it's just puzzles and games,it's a lot of fun.But then I came to realizethat mathematics is not this dry,dull, logical subject that people think it is.It's a very creative subject.People are surprised when I tell them that.But even in mathematics,we have new ideas.And to do anything new,you do need inspiration,intuition,guesswork--you get it wrong, you go back,you do it again--and creative thought.And mathematicians talk a lot aboutbeauty and elegance,and it's true.And in that way,mathematics is a lot closerto something like musicor art.Well, that's just a little short videoabout why I study mathematics.So if you have been,thanks for watching.
