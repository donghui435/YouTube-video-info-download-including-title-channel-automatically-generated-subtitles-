to another video from teal injectoralright today we will start off with alittle refresher of circles andvocabulary associated with those circleshere I have drawn a circle a and pointsP and C are said to be on thecircumference of circle a if I draw theradii from AP and AC I form what iscalled a inscribed excuse me a centralangle and a central angle of course istwo radii of the same circle and makethat angle and that angle P AC is acentral angle and it is intercepts arcPC so it intercepts so that's like themouth of the pac-man right that's thearc that it intercepts and you mayrecall that the measure of the angle ishow we determine the measure of the arcall right so with that in mind let'sstart off with another circle circle aand I have drawn two scores on hereexcuse melb and RT and those two chords arecongruentnow I am going to try to figure out someadditional information so I've got onecircle two chords in the same circlewhich are congruent if I draw the radiithat are associated with those chordsnotice that they don't have to bevertical angles these are indeed notvertical anglesbut what do you knows well I drew fourradii rightso all those radii must be the same andwhat now just jumps out at you and ofyes of course I have two congruenttrianglesI have triangle la be congruent totriangle are eighty and why is thatyes of course it is because ofside-side-side it's got it marks rightthere in front of you okayif the angle excuse me if the trianglesare congruent then their parts must becongruent by cpctc and the part that iam most interested in is that one rightthere because these are isoscelestriangles and that's the vertex angleand what kind of angle is it that iscentral angle right so we can say thatif two chords in a circle are congruentthen they determine two congruentcentral angles and we have shown itright there now looking at my pictureagain what else what I could I jump toif those angles are congruentwell what must be true about Arc RT wellarc RT I don't know what it is but Iknow it's the same as that measure ofthat angle right the measure of Arc RTand the measure of Arc lab is the samething as the measure of Arclb and those two angles are congruent sothose arcs must be correct and that'sthe second conjecture today if twochords in a circle are congruent thenthey're intercepted arcs are alsocongruent moving on I have a circle I amgoing to create a chord well let's justput a chord single-coremaybe if I take this cord and I canalways make two radii from the endpointsof the courtwell what's special about the trianglethat I just formed and you think oh wellof course it's got those two arecongruent it's an isosceles triangle nowit could be an equilateral triangle soyes it could be equal at or but it'sdefinitely isosceles so this has comesinto play that I think that anequilateral is a special isoscelesall right so if it's isosceles well whatelse do we knowwell those are the ones that we that Ireally liked and when we're talkingabout order because what happens withthe order line in isosceles triangles itgoes down right there doesn't itand where exactly is that well it's themidpoint of the opposite side it'sperpendicular bisector and it also whatthe angle bisector that's the order lineright through there every isoscelestriangle now let's put that in words forthe circle I started off with a circleand I made a chord so I can say that theperpendicular bisector of a chord willalways always pass through the center ofthe circle all right now what else likeif I take that knowledge and I make achord here's chord EF if I find themidpoint of that chord I'm going to findit lamb right there that's the midpointthere's M if I connect the midpoint tothe center hmm what have must be trueabout this segment cm well if you fillout the diagram it looks exactly likethe one we did before right because nowI've got the isosceles triangle I've gota midpoint and going through the vertexangle oh yeah that's the order lineagain so in other words the segment fromthe midpoint of a chord to the centerwill always be perpendicular that's theeasy way of saying it's you know part ofthe order line right now on two tangentsand if you could remember back when wetalked about tangent a tangent is a linewhich intersects a circle at exactly onepoint and that points the point oftangencyand I am not sure if we talked aboutthis or not but it can't be any closerthat's that that really is if I move itcloser I mean it's got to be on thecircle right so that point is on thecircle and if I move it over here it'snot on it's not on l1 anymore right thatmakes sense but there's right therewhere it's on l1 and on the circlethat's the only point any fourth that'sactually the shortest distance rightit's the shortest distance from C to l1right well if it's the shortest distanceit is perpendicular right all theseother points if I move we move aroundhere it's either can see if I stay onthe circle or if I go on l1 alcohol stayover this way I go a little further soyes a tangent line to a circle isperpendicular to the radius drawn to thepoint of tangency now I want to drawanother tangent line so I'm going todraw it I am NOT constructing thisdrawing there's my point of tangencythere's l2and there's one point of tangency now wejust talked about that this has to beperpendicular right let's go ahead andlabel those that's a and B and here's eover here all right now a and B are thetwo points of tangency sees the centeroh these are red eyes so they must becongruent right what else do we know dowe know for a fact I mean this looksawfully like a kite but I'm not sure ifI would jump to that right nowI think I need to possibly draw anotherline what line do you think I shouldrollyes I think I should draw C II becauseif I draw a c e in I create twotriangles I create two right trianglesright and if I say that triangle let'sdo it right see AE is congruent totriangle CBE do you know why I've got anangle I'll get aside and God Oh anotherside because C II isn't is in bothtriangles right there see in C and it'snot angle side side no it's the specialone it's by hypotenuse leg right I havea hypotenuse and a leg of two righttriangles and those two are congruentso if those two are congruent so must bethe opposite leg right here bone andthis one now I didn't write out thewhole proof I'm gonna let you do thatduring class these two segments arecongruent and I'm going to call thisintersection tangents conjecture and iftwo tangents of a circle intersect thenthe distance from the intersection pointto the point of tangency will be equalall right I think that's pretty goodright okay now last thing we have is alittle vocabulary and we need to talkabout tangent circles tangent circlesare two circles that are tangent to thesame line at the same point they can beinternally tangent or externally tangentso let's draw that real quick if I havea circle maybe I don't want the samesize circle here's a circle here ifthey're externally tangent they looklike snowman if they're internallytangent they look like something like Idon't know if you all know what aspirograph is or maybe a watch or anolive so this is externally tangent andthis is internal tangent good luck seeyou tomorrow have all those conjectureswritten down or typed up or have fundoing this all right we're back dailyassignment see you next time
