hey everyone thank you for joining us onthis short lesson where we explore whythe angle measure of any straight lineis always 180 degrees professionalbasketball coach Jason Kidd once madethe statement we're going to turn thisteam around 360 degrees after joining anew team the response from his fans werenot good so let's go ahead and breakdown this quote and explore why the fanswere so upset let's start by thinkingabout the number of degrees in one fullcircle which we know is 360 now at thetime of this quote Jason Kidd had justjoined a team with a strong history oflosing his vow to turn the team around360 degrees would mean that they wouldstill be a losing team so let's explorewhy Jason misspoke if we think about ahalf circle 360 divided by 2 is equal to180 and 180 degree turn would take theteam from losing to winning so Jason'soriginal quote was incorrect and what heshould have said was he was going toturn the team around 180 degrees and not360 boom so now let's go ahead andexplore the question why can we say thatthe angle measure of a straight line is180 degrees so the big idea here iswhere is that number 180 coming fromso just like earlier let's think of afull circle which we know has an anglemeasure of 360 degrees now if we bisectthat circle or cut it in half with aline 360 degrees divided by 2 is equalto 180 so any straight line has an anglemeasure of 180 degrees because itrepresents half of a circle so let's goahead and visualize this conceptand conclude that the angle measure ofany straight line is 180 degrees sinceit represents half of a circle so nowall you have to do is keep that conceptin mind as you apply it to other topicsin geometry and we'll see you next timethanks a lot guys for checking us outand please follow us on instagram atmash up map for daily math tips animatedflashcards and our math in sports andinfographics check it out
