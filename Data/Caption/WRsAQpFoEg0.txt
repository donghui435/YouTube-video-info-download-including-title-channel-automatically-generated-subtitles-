in this section we use the law ofcosines to solve for the missing partsin some triangles for our first problemwe have solved triangle ABCif side a is 410 meters side C is 340meters and angle B is 150 1.5 degrees soyou can see I've drawn a little pictureright here of the situation angle B isincluded between sides a and side C so Ican use the law of cosines here to solvefor side B and here's the law of cosinesB squared is equal to a squared plus Csquared minus 2a C cosine of angle B soaccording to law of cosines this isgoing to be the formula I'm going to usewhatever side I have over here it's theother two sides right here and then theangle that goes here is the angle that'sopposite this side so let's fill inthese numbers for this situation so Ihave a squared which is going to be 410squared plus 340 squared minus 2 times 410 times 340 times cosine of 150 1.5degrees now I've worked that out in thecalculator on the calculator that comesout to be B squared equals five hundredand twenty eight thousand seven hundredand fourteen that's B squared now I takethe square root of that to get B androunding to three significant digits Iget seven hundred and twenty-sevenmeters so that's side B seven hundredand twenty seven meters using law ofcosines so I use the law of cosines tosolve for side B now I have side B theangle opposite I can solve for eitherone of these two angles right here sinceI have a choice of which angles to solvefor using the law of sines let's use thelaw of sines to solve for angle C firstso using the law of sines I'm going tohave sine Cwhich is what I'm looking for is to sideC 340 as the sine of 150 1.5 degrees isto 727 so I set up my law of sines thatway solve for sine C and I won't showyou the work right here I put this onthe calculator and get approximately 0.2to 3/2 using my inverse sine button onthe calculator that tells me that angleC must be equal to 12 point 9 degrees so12 point 9 degrees I don't have to checkfor an angle C Prime like I would in theambiguous case because I already have anangle in this triangle that's biggerthan 90 degrees so I'm not going to haveanother obtuse angle so there's no needto say 180 minus 12 point 9 degrees thisis angle C so angle C is equal to thatlast thing I have to do is find anglewhat is it a and angle a will be 180degrees minus 151 point five degreesplus my twelve point nine degrees andI've already worked that out also andthat comes out to be fifteen point sixthat's angle aso law of cosines first because I havean angle and the two sides included oneither side of the angle and so I use mylaw of cosines to find the side officeat that then I switch over to the law ofsines to find my next angle once I havethat I just subtract those the twoangles I already have from 180 degreesand I have my third angle and thattriangle then is solved completely let'sgo to our next problem if a is 38 metersB is 10 meters and C is 31 meters let'sfind the largest angle well let's draw alittle picture right here just to helpus out we have a B and C for my angleslet's see I'll label side a with 38 I'lllabel side B with 10 and I'll label sideC with 31 now when I look at my diagramright here I know that the largest angleis opposite the longest side so I see mylongest side is 38so my largest angle is going to be anglea and remember this is not drawn toscale I've just drawn this triangle so Ihave something to label so I'm going tosolve for angle a first using the law ofcosines and the law of cosines tells methis cosine of angle a will be B squaredplus C squared minus a squared alldivided by to be C so according to lawof cosines I can write the law ofcosines that way to solve for angle alet's substitute in now and I'll havelet's see 10 squared plus 31 squaredminus 38 squared all divided by 2 times10 times 31 I've worked that out on acalculator that comes out to be negativezero point six one seven seven negativezero point six one seven seven and thatimplies that when I use my inversecosine button on my calculator thatangle whoops not B but angle a comes outto be 128 degreesso pretty simple using the law ofcosines to find the largest angle inthis triangle it's going to be oppositeto longest side here's my law of cosinesthat formula for cosine of asubstituting these values get out thisdecimal right here inverse cosine buttonon the calculator a is equal to 128degrees rounded to the nearest degree soI have my significant figures right herethat's a look at the law of cosines
