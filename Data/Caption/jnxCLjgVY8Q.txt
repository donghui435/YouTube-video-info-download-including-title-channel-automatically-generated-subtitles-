there are a few special things we needto understand about triangles for anytriangle the sum of any two sides isalways greater than the third side whatdoes that mean to understand let's namethe triangle ABC look at any two sidessay these two their sum would be a Bplus BC since this is a triangle we canbe sure that it is greater than thethird side which is AC what about thesetwo sides AC plus BC yes it will begreater than a B and similarly a B plusAC will be greater than BC this iscalled the triangle inequality theoreminequality since we don't have an equalto anywhere sum of any two sides in atriangle will always be greater than thethird side of that triangle the best wayto try this out is by drawing a triangleand measuring the sides this conditionwill always be satisfied
