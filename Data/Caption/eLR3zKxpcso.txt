I want to show you a cool way to multiply
two numbers.Start with the parabola y=x^2.Now choose two positive
numbers, say 11 and 7.From the origin, go 11 units to the left and
7 units to the right.Go up from each point to the curve,
then form the straight line joining thesetwo points.The
place where the line crosses the y-axis is77, the product of
11 and 7.This is no coincidence.To multiply a and b, go
a units to the left and b units to the right,take each point
up to the curve, draw the line connectingthem, and
interesect the y-axis at the value a timesb.You can try
this yourself by printing out a copy of thegraph found on the
webpage given in the video description.Try different
starting numbers and see that it really works!I first heard of this some years ago when
I visited the Mathematikum,a fantastic mathematics museum in Giessen,
Germany.Besides
having puzzles with shapes and celebratingnumbers,
they exhibit a parabolic calculator.By using pegs to mark the two points on the
curve, a string withweights on the ends forms the straight line.Why does the parabolic calculator work?The slope of the line
segment joining these two points simplifiesto b-a, while the slope
of the segment joining these other two pointsis the same.This means that the point (0,ab) is on the
line joining the outertwo points, and we've completed the proof.This parabolic technique shows that multiplication
isconnected to squaring numbers, a fact seen
by thisformula.Let me leave you with this simple question:
how can you use the parabola to multiply 7and -4?Think about it.
