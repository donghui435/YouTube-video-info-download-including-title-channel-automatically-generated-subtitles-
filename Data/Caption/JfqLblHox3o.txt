the triangles below are similar find themissing length in triangle B e G so themissing length is right here we'recalling it length X so similar trianglestwo ways to think about similartriangles all of the correspondingangles are congruent and we see thathere this angle corresponds to thatangle and they're the same because theyhave the same one arc there this anglecorresponds to this angle they both havethe two arcs there and both of thesehave a measure of 90 degrees they areboth right-angles the other way to thinkabout similar triangles is that theratio between corresponding sides are isthe same so for example this side rightover here be e be E is between the rightangle right over here and this one arcangle right over there that sidecorresponds to T a let me write thatdownso B I'll do it down here I'll do itright over here side B e correspondscorresponds to side corresponds to sidet a and we know because this anglecorresponds to that angle that anglecorresponds to that angle and thesesides are the ones in between them wealso know that side II X which is theone that we have to figure out thelength of we also know that side e^xright over or neck stretch to eg we knowthat side EG over here corresponds toits between the right angle and thedouble arc angle between the right anglein the double arc angle it correspondsto side AP it corresponds to side AP andwe know from similar triangles that theratio between corresponding sides has tobe the same so for example the ratiobetween B E and ta has to be the same asthe ratio between EG and AP so let's doit write that down the ratio between bee and let me write it down here actuallyso I have a little bit more space theratio between segment B II and segmentTA and segment TA has to be equal to theratio between segment design and velubetween segments eachII between segments eg and segment APand we know the length of B II we knowthat that is equal to 9 this is equal to9 to give us that right over there andwe know that ta is equal to 3 this isequal to 3 so 9 over 3 has got to beequal to eg over AP and we also knowwhat AP is AP they give us right overthere is length 4 so this boils down to9 divided by 3 which is just 3 must beequal to eg when eg actually let's justcall that X since they call it X this isgoing to be equal to X it is equal to xover 4 eg is X AP is 4 and to solve thisfor X you just have to multiply bothsides by 4 you multiply both sides by 4these fours cancel out this becomes 12so you get X must be equal to 12 whichis a missing length on this triangleright over here
