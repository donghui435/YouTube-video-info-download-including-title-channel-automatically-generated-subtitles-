before I actually there you go I saidwe're gonna do two things today andthey're both about the scripture so thesecond thing under a good frequencydistribution table which is what you'reconstructing right now is somethingyou've put off before it's called astem-and-leaf plot now could you raiseyour hand if that phrase rings a bellokay thank you here's them now you'veseen stem-and-leaf plots before maybeyou didn't realize the stem-and-leafplots are just this it's a kind of wayto group data together okay yeah don'tfreak out I'm going to put this tableback in about five minutes once I'm doneso you know you'll see it again but Iwant to show you what we would do if wetook the same data and instead made astem-and-leaf plot okay so this is kindof what it's heavily for looks likeagain you've got a left-hand part whichis like the beginnings of your numbersand then you've got the end part whichis the final digit of whatever thesescores are okay so hopefully as I startto construct this wing a bit ago now theimportant thing you need to rememberit's just like this scientific notationthere are sort of rules around this tomake it consistent from leaves leaves itthey've always got a one digit one okaynow these are all three-digit numbersokay so if my leaves are one digit howBIG's the stem down a bit it's got to bethe other two okay so I look at all ofthese numbers and I'm saying what's thesmallest numberI think the smallest number is a hundredand eighty something where is it thereit is Vicki one of these expects thesmallest number I can see to the bottomof my range and the highest number is250 something I think 250 exactly thereokay yeah good so 250 something that'sthe highest number so therefore for mystems okay these are the stems I'm goingto write up my my smallest one is goingto be 18 because a hundred and eightysomethingquestion yeah maybe leave some space andthen come backI will I will shut all of these so ifyou don't get to do it right nowit'll be been there in a minute 18 19 2021 22 23 24 and 25 now I've been a bitnaughty because I've said it as 18 19 20etcetera it's actually 180 190 something250 something so he's the first twodigits are the three-digit numbernow I'm going to do just fine I didbefore I'm going to go through this datathese are my groups these are my classesokay all the numbers in the 100'sall the numbers in the 190s and so onand this time instead of just doingItalian I'm actually going to drive hisnumbers down okay so again from thebeginningthe first one is 244 so which stem am Igoing to go to the 24 good the secondlast one and I'm gonna say 4 uh yeahI'll get to that in a second so this isa regular stem and leaf plot there is anordered similarly popping what's yourfive years what makes most sets is tomake this the number one first and thenwork worried about the order becauseotherwise well you'll see what willhappen remember the important thing isI'm I don't wanna miss any data right soremember I had 244 so I'm just gonna gosystematically from the top left toright etcetera so my next one is 220 220230 to again this is a somewhat lengthyprocess so once you finish this you'regoing to get something like this okayall right now you can see this is not inorderI don't we plan it out right this is abit of a sort of dogs breakfast teamlater on we will use stem and leaf plotsto work out these things called themedian quartiles etc and you need twonumbers in order to do that so I'm notready for this but can you see like inorder to do this in order from the firsttime I need to know what every singlenumber over here is unlike I have to gothrough every one of them first whereasnow I could say alright I'm just goingto go 0 and then a 1 and then there's ato actually to 0 sorry and so on so I'lltake this and then I'll put it intowater ok so this is a stem and leaf plotandI hope you can see just look at that fora second and compare it to the Tally'sthat you were making before okay you'representing the same Donna you should seethe same kind of humps and costes andthat kind of thing okaywhat other super cool thing about seveno'clock ok now you can actually justturn your page around when you've donethis but when I turn my iPad the screenstays the same so instead I'm going todo this the stem-and-leaf plot isactually two graphs in one because ifyou look at it carefully and turn yourpage around what you've actually createdis not just a seminary plot but let mefill it in for you this is a bar graphright look you've just created anotherrepresentation that again helps you seethe patterns in the data that's whatit's all aboutok so what you need to do is just turnyour head and there it is
