- IF F OF X IS NEGATIVE, 
INCREASING, AND CONCAVE DOWNTHEN THE ANTIDERIVATIVE FUNCTION 
BIG F OF XIS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:DECREASING IN CONCAVE UP,DECREASING IN CONCAVE DOWN,INCREASING IN CONCAVE DOWN 
OR INCREASING IN CONCAVE UP.LET'S BEGIN BY REVIEWING 
THE DEFINITIONOF THE ANTIDERIVATIVE FUNCTION.BIG F OF X IS AN ANTIDERIVATIVE 
OF SMALL F OF XIF BIG F PRIME OF X EQUALS SMALL 
F OF X.SO NOTICE HOW HERE 
WHEN WE'RE GIVEN INFORMATIONABOUT F OF X WE CAN THINK 
OF THIS AS INFORMATIONABOUT BIG F PRIME OF X.AGAIN, BECAUSE BIG F OF X 
IS THE ANTIDERIVATIVE OF F OF XIT'S DERIVATIVE 
EQUALS SMALL F OF X.SO TO BEGIN WE'RE TOLD THAT 
F OF X IS NEGATIVEWHICH MEANS BIG F PRIME 
OF X IS NEGATIVEAND THE SIGN OF THE FIRST 
DERIVATIVE INDICATESWHETHER A FUNCTION IS INCREASING 
OR DECREASING.SO BECAUSE BIG F PRIME OF X 
IS NEGATIVE BIG F OF XWOULD HAVE TO BE DECREASING.SO AGAIN, IF F OF X IS NEGATIVE 
WHICH EQUALS BIG F PRIME OF XTHIS INDICATES THAT BIG F
IS DECREASING.REMEMBER OUR GOAL 
HERE IS TO INDICATEWHICH OF THESE IS TRUE ABOUT BIG 
F OF X.NEXT WE'RE TOLD THAT F OF X 
IS INCREASING.WELL IF F OF X IS INCREASING 
THEN F PRIME OF XWOULD HAVE TO BE POSITIVE 
AND IF F PRIME OF X IS POSITIVETHEN BIG F DOUBLE PRIME OF X 
WOULD ALSO BE POSITIVE.SO AGAIN, F PRIME OF X EQUALS 
BIG F DOUBLE PRIME OF XWHICH WE KNOW IS POSITIVEAND THE SECOND DERIVATIVE 
INDICATES CONCAVITYSO BECAUSE THE SECOND DERIVATIVE 
OF BIG F IS POSITIVETHIS MEANS BIG F OF X WOULD HAVE 
TO BE CONCAVE UP.IF THE SECOND DERIVATIVE WAS 
LESS THAN ZERO OR NEGATIVETHAT MEANS BIG F 
WOULD BE CONCAVE DOWNAND WE'RE ALSO TOLD THAT F OF X 
IS CONCAVE DOWN.WELL IF F OF X IS CONCAVE DOWNTHAT MEANS THE SECOND DERIVATIVE 
OF FWHICH IS ACTUALLY THE THIRD 
DERIVATIVE OF BIG FWOULD HAVE TO BE NEGATIVE.BUT THIS INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY 
NOT NEEDEDTO ANSWER THE QUESTION.WE NOW KNOW THAT BIG F 
IS DECREASING AND CONCAVE UPAND THEREFORE OUR ANSWER IS THIS 
FIRST CHOICE HERE DECREASINGAND CONCAVE UP.LET'S FINISH BY SKETCHING A 
POSSIBLE GRAPH FOR BIG F OF X.BECAUSE BIG F IS DECREASING WE 
KNOW AS X INCREASES Y DECREASESOR THE FUNCTION MUST GO DOWNHILL 
FROM LEFT TO RIGHT,AND IF THE FUNCTION IS CONCAVE 
UP IT MUST RESEMBLE AT LEASTA PIECE OF A GRAPH THAT LOOKS 
LIKE THIS BUT AGAIN,BECAUSE OUR FUNCTION 
IS DECREASINGIT WILL ONLY RESEMBLE THE LEFT 
SIDE OF THIS GRAPHTHAT'S CONCAVE UP SO BIG F OF X 
COULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS.NOTICE HOW THE FUNCTION IS 
DECREASING AND CONCAVE UP.I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL.
