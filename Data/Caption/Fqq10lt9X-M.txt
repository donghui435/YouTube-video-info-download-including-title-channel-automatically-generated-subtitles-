Okay.So, let's explain what these machinesare actually doing.So, let's go back to the 2¡ú1machine first.And the idea was that the dots hereare always worth one.I've set up the game so that dots in the rightmost boxare just worth one dot.However, in a 1<--2 machine where there's a second dotin the same box,they explode -  kaboom! -to make one dot one place to the left.So, this dot here must be worthtwo of these guys, two ones.It must be worth two, two ones.By the same token, two dots here,two twos - kapow! -are the same as one dot here.So, this dot must be worth two twos, namelyfour, and two of these make one of them,so it must be worth two fours, eight.Two of them make one of these two eights a 16.Two 16s makes the next one, 32;two of those, 64, and so on.Bingo.So, there are the values of the dots in a 1 <--2 machine.Now, if you tried it,you may have noticed that 13 has the code 1101,and we can check if that's right or wrong.Now, we could see if that's right or wrongby doing the following.Let's actually put in the dots:one dot, one dot, zero dot, one dot.Here it goes: one dot, one dot, no dots ¨Cit's just big smudge, and one dot - 1101.Can you see now that is indeed the correct codefor 13 in a 1<--2 machine - one eight, one four,no twos, and one one;that does indeed make 13.Beautiful!All right.What's going on with the 3¡ú1 machine?Well, same idea. I¡¯ve set this game upso the dots here are always worth one.But now, three of these - one, two, three - explodeand are equivalent to one of those.This must be worth three of these;three ones is three.Three of these guysmake one of them - three threes is nine.Three of these makes one of those - three nines is 27.Three of these makes the next one, 81, and so on.All right. If you tried it,you may have noticed that the code for 13 is 111.Well, I¡¯ve just said that. Let's check if it's correct.Let me put in one dot, one dot, one dot.One dot, one dot, one dot.One nine, one three,one one does indeed make 13.That is absolutely correct.I can see it's correct.Absolutely beautiful!And, by the same token, based are the 10¡ú1 machine,dots here are always worth one,but then ten of these make one of those -ten ones is ten.Ten of these makes one of those.Ten tens is a 100.Ten of these makes one of them -ten 100s is 1,000, and so on.And, if we had to code 273 being 2-7-3,two dots, seven dots, and three dots.And, in fact, now we can see we're correct -two 100s, seven 10s,and three does indeed make the number 273.In fact, this is what I just said.But if I write it in words -two hundred seventy three -in English at least,we can see we're literally speaking this 10¡ú1 machine.We say two hundred; there it is, 200.Seventy, T-Y, and in English that T-Y is short for ten;seven 10s and three.We're literally saying 273.We're speaking 10¡ú1 machine.So, right now it begs the question:why does societylike the 10¡ú1 machine for doing numbers?What is it about our humanness that made us thinkten is the right thing for counting?Well, it literally is our humanness.When we think counting, we think of our physiology.We have ten fingers. We count with ten fingers.So, ten feels very natural to usfor writing and doing mathematics,numbers, and so forth, great, which is interestingbecause I happen to know that Martians have two handsbut only have four fingers on each hand.Will they naturally think ten for counting?No, they will think eight.So, actually, Martians will probably want to workwith an 8¡ú1 machine.I think that's very natural and normal;  8¡ú1 machines.So, that'll work with base 8.Ah, bases, I've just used the name for this.The mathematical name for this work is bases.Welcome to base 10,everything working on powers of ten.Welcome to base 2, everything working on powers of two.In fact, this is a very handy base in computer sciencebecause computers are builton little electrical switches that have got to be either on or off.They¡¯ll have just two states.They are trying to represent all of mathematicswith either two symbols, on/off symbols, that's it.So, actually, it's very handyto have a system arithmeticthat only ever uses two symbols,1 for On, 0 for Off.And now, I can encode mathematics in computersusing base two, also called binary.This is a very good base for computer science.Actually, there is talk of building optic computersbased on polarized light.That is they'll use planes of lightthat come in one direction,or planes of light that come in an orthogonal direction -90 degrees - or use no light at all.So, these computerswill actually work on three different states.So, they¡¯d want to use a system arithmeticthat uses three symbols.In which case, base 3is very appropriate for optic computers.If we build them, we'd be doing computer sciencein base 3 all of a sudden.But us humans like base 10.We go with the 10¡ú1machine because of our physiology.Oh, actually, that's not always the case.There are some cultures on this planet that likebase 20 - 20¡ú1 machines.Where's 20 coming from?When you think about it for a moment, they must be peoplevery aware of their fingers and toes.You can't see my toes, but we haveten fingers and ten toes. We have 20 digits in all.So, some people think 20 is a very good wayfor counting. Great! They might go with base 20.In fact, we have vestigesof base 20 in the Western world.For example, how are you standingin the United States right now?And, I know there's a very famous speechgiven by Abraham Lincoln called the Gettysburg Addressthat begins this way:He said, "Fourscore and seven years ago."All right. ¡°Fourscore and seven years ago¡± -how many years ago is that actually?So, what's he saying there?Well, it turns out score is a very old word for 20.So, you're saying four 20sand seven years ago - 87 years ago.Abraham Lincoln, in that very famous speech,was actually speaking base 20 right then.And, actually, if you speak French,I happen to know that they say87 in very curious ways there.Now, I don't speak French so forgive me,but I believe 87 is something like quatre-vingt sept,which literally, word for word,is quatre-vingt¡ªfour 20s, sept¡ªand seven.Four 20s and seven, another bit of base 20 again.Ooh, it gets even worse¡­ or more exciting, I should say.There are some cultures that actually thinkbase 12 is a good way to go.And, they see something on their humannessthat makes them think you can countto 12 very naturally, that just on one handyou can count to 12 very naturally. How?Well, they use their thumb as a pointer,and then notice that each of the fingersis divided into three sections.In which case, counting 12 is very natural:one, two, three, four, five, six,seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.So, there are some cultures that work with base 12.In fact, in marketing,in trade and measures, and so forth,it's very good to have units of 12.How many inches are in a foot?Twelve of them.What's a dozen? Twelve items.Because if you're doing trade in the marketplace,for example, you often come acrossthe fractions of 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and so forth,and 12 is a very friendly number for those fractions.Half of 12 is a good whole number 6.A quarter of 12 is a good whole number 3.A third of 12 is a good whole number 4.Twelve is very goodfor basic fractions in everyday life.However, ten is a bit awkward.You could do a half of ten pretty well, that's great,but a third of ten? Ugh.A quarter of ten? Ugh,not very good.All right. So, there we have it.So, society, in the Western world at least,goes with the 10¡ú1 machine, base 10.So, what I want to do nowis explore the mathematics of base 10.We've got a very good visual model.In fact, this model is amazing.If we stare at this deeply enough ¨C excuse me ¨Cwe will see that a whole portal of wonder and mysteryand delight and intrigue and deep understandingcomes just from this picture.In fact, let¡¯s go throughthe entire school curriculum on arithmeticand some algebra and beyondjust you playing with these pictures,and we'll see how magical it actually is.Oh, it's going to be a lot of fun.
