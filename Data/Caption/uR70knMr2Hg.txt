Hello. I'm Professor Von Schmohawk
and welcome to Why U.So far we have seen how to define a seteither by listing its membersor by using set-builder notationto state the properties that
every element of the set must satisfy.We also described several types of relations
that can exist between sets.In this lecture, we will describe several
operations which can be performed on setssuch as intersections and unionsand see how these relations and operations
can be visualized graphicallyby using what is called a Venn Diagram.In a Venn diagram, sets are usually represented
by circles or other types of enclosed areas.The interior of the circle
represents all the elements of the setwhile the exterior represents any elements
that are not members of the set.For instance, let's say that we have two sets,
A and B.Drawing the sets so that they don't overlapimplies that the two sets contain
completely different elements.In this case, we say that the two sets
are "disjoint".Disjoint sets have no elements in common.If the two circles overlapthis indicates that there are one or more
elements common to both sets.The intersecting area represents elements
that are members of both A and B.This collection of common elements is called
the "intersection" of sets A and B.We denote set intersection by a symbol
which looks like an inverted U.This collection of common elements
forms a new set.For example, if set A contains the elements
1, 2, and 3and set B contains 2, 3 and 4then the elements which A and B have in common
are 2 and 3and this intersection forms a new set
containing the elements 2 and 3.Two disjoint sets have no elements in common
so their intersection forms the empty set.Forming the intersection of two sets
is a binary set operationin the same way that forming the sum
of two numbersis a binary numerical operation.The result of this set operation
is another setjust as the result of this numerical operation
is another number.Using set-builder notationwe can write the definition of
an intersection of two sets formally asThe intersection of sets A and Bis the set of all elements xsuch thatx is a member of Aand x is a member of B.Another important set operation
is the "union" of sets.The union of two sets A and Bincludes all elements which are members
of either A or B.If sets A and B have any elements in commonthen these elements
which are members of both setsare only included once in the union.For example, if set A contains the elements
1, 2, and 3and set B contains 2, 3 and 4then the elements which are members
of A or B are 1, 2, 3, and 4.This union forms a new set
containing the elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.Notice that even though 2 and 3
are members of both sets A and B2 and 3 are only listed once
when we write the union.Using set-builder notationwe can write the definition of
the union of two sets formally asThe union of sets A and Bis the set of all elements xsuch thatx is a member of Aor x is a member of B.Subsets and supersets can also be represented
using Venn Diagrams.In a Venn Diagram, a subset is typically shown
as a smaller region within the larger superset.For instance, in this diagram
set A is a subset of Band set B is a superset of A.If we use a Venn diagramto illustrate the relations between the sets
of numbers we have studied in pre-algebrait might look like this.Remember that in a Venn diagramalthough sets are usually represented
by circles or ovalsthey can be illustrated by any type of
enclosed area.This diagram shows
that the set of natural numbersis a subset of the set of whole numberswhich is a subset of the set of rational numbers.The union of the set of rational numbersand the set of irrational numbersforms the set of real numbers.So far we have seen
how various relations between setsas well as set operations
such as intersections and unionscan be represented using Venn Diagrams.In the next lecture
we will see how Venn Diagramscan be used to visualize
more complex operations.
