hey yo welcome to the Tech math Channelwe're gonna be looking at today is it'san easier way of doing long division I'mgoing to launch straight into it it'sprobably going to take a couple ofvideos to our get through I'm going tosort of deal with it in sections I'mgoing to deal with it you know obviouslygetting into the easy stuff firstand then more and more difficult as wego along so first off I'm just going tolaunch straight into what I mean bythese and it's this sort of questionhere which we're going to be having alook at so how many times does 19 gointo 40 2016 so there's a couple ofthings that I'm going to draw yourattention to just before we start thisparticular question because once you getthe idea of these the rest of this otherthan how to divide by this certaincertain numbers here are big numbers youknow bigger than 10 becomes a whole loteasier once you get just a few littletricks because this is just a little bitof a different way of doing normaldivision okay so first off the firstthing you'll probably want to noticewith this is it 19 I'm going to rub that19 out and I'm going to put it over here19 because probably actually a minutelooking at is a number which comes upnext after 19 which is 20 ok so then thenearest tens number to this particularand number here ok is 20 how much do wehave to get to to actually do that is wehave to add one number on some cutthrough things which is really reallyimportant to get here first off we'reactually dividing by the number two not19 the other thing is this idea of thisnumber here this this is this thingcalled we're going to call it amultiplier okay and this thing whenwe're dealing with number 19 and there'sa multiplier 1 1 times a number it justgives us another we've already got butthis thing becomes more importantespecially we start dividing bydifferent sorts of numbers 18 17 westart to get different multipliers and Istart to do slightly different thingsdon't get too confused yet ok so I'mjust going to start off in how to dothis 10is a bit of a weird type of divisionbecause the actual answer we're gettinghelps get further parts of the answerand you'll see what I mean by thisso first off this part here we're goingto start off here and what we're goingto be looking at is this particular onewe're going to go there's like normaldivision 4 divided by 2 okay what's 4divided by 2 that's 2there's no remainder there nice and easyokay so let's get to the next part hereokay so this bit here we're going to twonow as I said before we're going to usepart of our answer we've already got toget our next part of the answer okaywell show this is where we start to meanthis where we start to use this herewhat we do here is we actually add thistwo to this multiplier to the multipliertimes this number here I'll show youwhat I meanso this is like two we're going to endanswer this we're going to add thisnumber here is 2 so 2 Plus this numberhere times the multiplying themultipliers 1 so we're going to add 2plus 2 which equals 4 and this is thenumber we're going to see how many timesto you guys into it bear with us withthis it does take a bit of getting usedto punch it once you get used it'snothing back so 4 divided by 2 equalsclip all right the next part of ouranswer is it - all rightwe carried over we'll get to this nextbit of the answer again so we're go tozero now this is zero we have to addsomething to its review remember it'sthis number we look previously this toI'm leaving to multiply these two by themultiply so by oneokay so two point one is two so nothingplus two equals to 2 divided by 2 nowequals 1 that's the next part of ouranswer okay we're going to get up tothis are this parts okay so we let the 1here now so what do we do we remember 1and we're going to add to that this oneheretimes multiples at one time one pointfive one is one plus one equals two -now / the two here equals one that'sthat part of our answer so this is ouranswer is so far 2211 now this leads usthe very last number here I'm going toshould draw a bit of a line here becausethis is actually our remainder that weget in here okay so what are we going toget to where remainder well so theremainder here look six and what do weneed to do to that six well we need toadd this number here the one so six plusone is seventhis is our remainder remain a sentimentthat's our answer pretty cool rightreally I recommend trying to go throughthat again go through it a bit slowlyand that's what a deal but it works okayyou're just going to keep using thatprevious number okay so I'm going togive it another gousing 19 here they don't only do on thenext video I do I'm actually going tostart bearing up this number and showingyou what happens when we use differentmultipliers but once you get used tothis and it doesn't take very long asit's the same process again and againit's a really really really great fastmethod of doing long division so let'slet's get on to this next question hereso say we'll have a look at 19 again howmany times is 19 go into say even abigger number now 28,000 104 okayso again I'll move this 19 up here okayand because what I'm going to do is if Iadd 1 to it again by a multiply here I'mgoing to end up getting 20 okay but it'sa bit too I'm going to be dividing intoitthis again is my multiplier okayI think that's provide big thingsagainst that which ones are multipliedthis one's a little bit harder than aprevious one so let's start out here westart with this number here so - andwe're dividing to say highlight againwe're dividing this number into with thetwo so two divided by two equals one agood nice easy start alright alrightlet's get on to the next onerub that out and we'll get onto thisnext number here okay this is a eight soif you remember what do I do to thiseight well I've got to add this numberon here okay and then times up by themultiply so one times a multiply onetimes one is one and I'm going to add itto eight so eight plus one equals 9now in this nine I divide by 2 9 dividedby two equals four we've got a remainderof one so what I'm gonna do with thisone is I'm going to take it across tothe next part of the question okay andI'm going to put the four down here allright let's get on to this next bit nowthis remainder here this C here we willbe using that now in fact we're going touse it right now because it doesn't giveus a 1 because we have to move the oneacross Mexico than 11 okay 11 wanted todo that we're going to add four timesthe multiply which is 4 so let's add 4to it and we get 15 all right we givethis 15 now we divide it by 2 and itequals 7 remainder 1 okay so sevenremainder 1all right and then we'll get onto thislast number before the remainder okayremember this last number here is theremainder so we go here ten plus sevenokay seven times one and seven equalsseventeen okayseventeen now divided by two equalseight remainder of 1 so remainder of onethere okay and this now just leaves usto work out what the remainder is okaywe've got most of our answer there we'rejust now left working at the remainderand that's a very very simple matterhere so we're getting at fourteen and weadd this eight to it which were times bythe multiply which also is eight so 14plus eight equals 22 okaynow what you're going to notice aboutthis 22 we have a remainder of 22 butthis remainder we had is bigger than thenumber we're actually dividing by so wecan get a 19 and this is my tape 19 outof it I get the answer of 3 so we canend up the remainder of 3 and that one19 I've got out of it I'm just going toget rid of that right here I'm going toadd it on here okay so our answer shouldbeone four seven nine remainder three okayso I hope you understand those the nextvideo you're going to be getting on withwe're going to be looking at this alittle bit further we're going to startgetting into the numbers where we justwe're going to change mainly thesenumbers around to start with and thenget into the video afters where we startto change the multipliers okay but Ithink small steps when you start doingthese so any questions let us know Ihope you get final note I'll see younext time
