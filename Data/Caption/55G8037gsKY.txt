In this video, I'm going to do
several examples of quadraticequations that are really of a
special form, and it's reallya bit of warm-up for the next
video that we're going to doon completing the square.So let me show you what
I'm talking about.So let's say I have 4x
plus 1 squared, minus8 is equal to 0.Now, based on everything we've
done so far, you might betempted to multiply this out,
then subtract 8 from theconstant you get out here, and
then try to factor it.And then you're going to have
x minus something, times xminus something else
is equal to 0.And you're going to say, oh, one
of these must be equal to0, so x could be that or that.We're not going to do that this
time, because you mightsee something interesting
here.We can solve this without
factoring it.And how do we do that?Well, what happens if
we add 8 to bothsides of this equation?Then the left-hand side of the
equation becomes 4x plus 1squared, and these
8's cancel out.The right-hand becomes
just a positive 8.Now, what can we do to both
sides of this equation?And this is just kind
of straight, vanillaequation-solving.This isn't any kind of
fancy factoring.We can take the square root of
both sides of this equation.We could take the square root.So 4x plus 1-- I'm just taking
the square root of both sides.You take the square root of both
sides, and, of course,you want to take the positive
and the negative square root,because 4x plus 1 could be the
positive square root of 8, orit could be the negative
square root of 8.So 4x plus 1 is equal to the
positive or negativesquare root of 8.Instead of 8, let me write
8 as 4 times 2.We all know that's what 8 is,
and obviously the square rootof 4x plus 1 squared
is 4x plus 1.So we get 4x plus 1 is equal
to-- we can factor out the 4,or the square root of 4, which
is 2-- is equal to the plus orminus times 2 times the square
root of 2, right?Square root of 4 times square
root of 2 is the same thing assquare root of 4 times the
square root of 2, plus orminus the square root of 4
is that 2 right there.Now, it might look like a really
bizarro equation, withthis plus or minus 2 times
the square of 2,but it really isn't.These are actually two numbers
here, and we're actuallysimultaneously solving
two equations.We could write this as 4x plus
1 is equal to the positive 2,square root of 2, or 4x plus 1
is equal to negative 2 timesthe square root of 2.This one statement is equivalent
to this right here,because we have this plus or
minus here, this or statement.Let me solve all of these
simultaneously.So if I subtract 1 from
both sides of thisequation, what do I have?On the left-hand side, I'm
just left with 4x.On the right-hand side, I
have-- you can't reallymathematically, I mean, you
could do them if you had acalculator, but I'll just leave
it as negative 1 plus orminus the square root, or 2
times the square root of 2.That's what 4x is equal to.If we did it here, as two
separate equations, same idea.Subtract 1 from both sides of
this equation, you get 4x isequal to negative 1 plus 2,
times the square root of 2.This equation, subtract
1 from both sides.4x is equal to negative
1 minus 2, times thesquare root of 2.This statement right here is
completely equivalent to thesetwo statements.Now, last step, we just have to
divide both sides by 4, soyou divide both sides by 4,
and you get x is equal tonegative 1 plus or minus
2, times the squareroot of 2, over 4.Now, this statement is
completely equivalent todividing each of these by 4,
and you get x is equal tonegative 1 plus 2, times the
square root 2, over 4.This is one solution.And then the other solution is x
is equal to negative 1 minus2 roots of 2, all
of that over 4.That statement and these two
statements are equivalent.And if you want, I encourage you
to-- let's substitute oneof these back in, just so you
feel confident that somethingas bizarro as one of these
expressions can be a solutionto a nice, vanilla-looking
equation like this.So let's substitute
it back in.4 times x, or 4 times negative
1, plus 2 root 2, over 4, plus1 squared, minus 8
is equal to 0.Now, these 4's cancel out, so
you're left with negative 1plus 2 roots 2, plus
1, squared, minus8 is equal to 0.This negative 1 and this
positive 1 cancel out, soyou're left with 2 roots
of 2 squared, minus8 is equal to 0.And then what are you
going to have here?So when you square this, you
get 4 times 2, minus 8 isequal to 0, which is true.8 minus 8 is equal to 0.And if you try this one out,
you're going to get the exactsame answer.Let's do another
one like this.And remember, these are special
forms where we havesquares of binomials
in our expression.And we're going to see that the
entire quadratic formulais actually derived from a
notion like this, because youcan actually turn any, you can
turn any, quadratic equationinto a perfect square equalling
something else.We'll see that two
videos from now.But let's get a little
warmed up just seeingthis type of thing.So let's say you have x squared
minus 10x, plus 25 isequal to 9.Now, once again your
temptation-- and it's not abad temptation-- would be to
subtract 9 from both sides, soyou get a 0 on the right-hand
side, but before you do that,just inspect this really fast.
And say, hey, is this justmaybe a perfect square
of a binomial?And you see-- well, what two
numbers when I multiply them Iget positive 25, and when I add
them I get negative 10?And hopefully negative
5 jumps out at you.So this expression right here is
x minus 5, times x minus 5.So this left-hand side can be
written as x minus 5 squared,and the right-hand
side is still 9.And I want to really
emphasize.I don't want this to ruin all of
the training you've gottenon factoring so far.We can only do this when this
is a perfect square.If you got, like, x minus 3,
times x plus 4, and that wouldbe equal to 9, that would
be a dead end.You wouldn't be able to
really do anythingconstructive with that.Only because this is a perfect
square, can we now say x minus5 squared is equal to 9, and
now we can take the squareroot of both sides.So we could say that x minus 5
is equal to plus or minus 3.Add 5 to both sides of this
equation, you get x is equalto 5 plus or minus 3, or x is
equal to-- what's 5 plus 3?Well, x could be 8 or x could be
equal to 5 minus 3, or x isequal to 2.Now, we could have done this
equation, this quadraticequation, the traditional
way, the way you weretempted to do it.What happens if you subtract
9 from bothsides of this equation?You'll get x squared
minus 10x.And what's 25 minus 9?25 minus 9 is 16, and that
would be equal to 0.And here, this would be just a
traditional factoring problem,the type that we've seen
in the last few videos.What two numbers, when you take
their product, you getpositive 16, and when you sum
them you get negative 10?And maybe negative
8 and negative 2jump into your brain.So we get x minus 8, times
x minus 2 is equal to 0.And so x could be equal to 8
or x could be equal to 2.That's the fun thing about
algebra: you can do things intwo completely different ways,
but as long as you do them inalgebraically-valid ways,
you're not going to getdifferent answers.And on some level, if you
recognize this, this is easierbecause you didn't have to do
that little game in your head,in terms of, oh, what two
numbers, when you multiplythem you get 16, and when you
add them you get negative 10?Here, you just said, OK, this is
x minus 5-- oh, I guess youdid have to do it.You had to say, oh, 5 times 5
is 25, and negative 10 isnegative 5 plus negative 5.So I take that back, you still
have to do that littlegame in your head.So let's do another one.Let's do one more of these, just
to really get ourselvesnice and warmed up here.So, let's say we have x squared
plus 18x, plus 81 isequal to 1.So once again, we can
do it in two ways.We could subtract 1 from both
sides, or we could recognizethat this is x plus
9, times x plus 9.This right here, 9 times 9
is 81, 9 plus 9 is 18.So we can write our equation
as x plus 9squared is equal to 1.Take the square root of both
sides, you get x plus 9 isequal to plus or minus
the square root of 1,which is just 1.So x is equal to-- subtract 9
from both sides-- negative 9plus or minus 1.And that means that x could be
equal to-- negative 9 plus 1is negative 8, or x could be
equal to-- negative 9 minus 1,which is negative 10.And once again, you could have
done this the traditional way.You could have subtracted 1 from
both sides and you wouldhave gotten x squared plus 18x,
plus 80 is equal to 0.And you'd say, hey, gee, 8 times
10 is 80, 8 plus 10 is18, so you get x plus 8, times
x plus 10 is equal to 0.And then you'd get x could be
equal to negative 8, or xcould be equal to negative 10.That was good warm up.Now, I think we're ready to
tackle completing the square.
