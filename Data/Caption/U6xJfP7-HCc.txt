JAMES GRIME: There are people
out there who want to changethe way that you count.They want to change the world so
that we stop counting using10 symbols and start counting
using 12 symbols.I love them.I think these guys are great.Let's talk about what
we know so far.So, the way we count is
the decimal system.It uses 10 symbols.So, let's just write those
out, first of all.0, 1, 2, 8, 9.Once we get to this point, we
start to have to make ournumbers using combinations of
the symbols we've already got.12, 13, 14, 22, 23.Now, if we had been born with
six fingers on each hand, thenwe would have 12 fingers, and
maybe we would have startedusing something called the
dozenal system where it'sbased on 12 symbols.And there are some people out
there who think this is thesystem we should be using.They think we should have six
fingers on each hand.They're disappointed we don't
have six fingers on each hand,because they think it's a much
easier way to count.So first of all, if we're going
to use 12 symbols, Ineed two extra.Let's have a look at
what they suggest.For 10, we we're going to
have a symbol like this.That's called dek.And for 11, we're going to have
a symbol like this, whichis called el.So now it reads 0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, dek, el.This would be 12.In fact, they say do.So this is do, do 1, do 2, do 3,
do 4, do 5, do 6, do 7, do8, do 9, do dek, and do el.So, do el would be
12 and 11 more.So that's 23, and then
you keep counting.2 do is 24, so 2 do.Two do 1, 2 do 3, 2
do 4, and so on.Just like decimal
system, really.It's the exact same idea.There's no difference between
the dozenal system and thedecimal system.That would be 3 do, this
would be 4 do.You keep going and you would get
9 do, then you would getdek do, el do, and then
you'd get do do.do do.12 12s.12 12s, that's 144,
12 12s, or gross.So if we write that out, 12 12s
will be written like this.It's 144, or gross, or gro
So that would be a gro.Something like this
would be a mo.So if we take this year, it's
2012, which is a good year topick, since we were
talking about 12.So if we took the year 2012,
in the dozenal system, it'swritten like this.That is mo gro el 8.That's the current year if
you count in base 12.Now, there is a reason
why these guys wantto count this way.Because they say it's going to
make arithmetic much easier.I want to make this clear.For serious maths, this system
would not make any difference.But for day to day life, for
your regular shopping, theseguys reckon that this 12 system
would make life mucheasier because of the number
of factors that 12 has.So 10 has--let's see.How many factors does it have?It has 1.10 has 2, 5, and 10 itself.But 12 has much more factors.It has 1, it has 2, it has
3, it has 4, it has 6,and it has 12 itself.The reason this is useful is
it will make calculationsusing thirds and quarters
much easierthan they are in decimal.Let's do something like
a 4 times table.If we did that in decimal,
it would look like this.OK, it's 4, and then 2 times 4
is 8, 3 times 4 is 12, 4 times4 is 16, 5 times 4 is 20.If we did it with the dozenal
system, then it would have 4,and we would have 8, then we
would have do, which is theirword for 12.Then we would have do 4, do
8, 2 do, 2 do 4, 2 do 8,3 do, and so on.This pattern is a much easier
pattern to teach children.4, 8, 0, 4, 8, 0, 4, 8, 0.The patterns are much
easier to see.But the real strength of it is
when you start dividing.If we wanted something like 1/3,
you know in decimal thatthis is 0.3333, it goes on
forever, which is fairly ugly.But in the dozenal system, it
suddenly becomes really nice.If I want to write 1/3,
that'd be 4 out of do.4/12 is 1/3.4 out of do, which
is equal to 0.4.1/3 written in this
system is 0.4.It's not something that
goes on forever.That's the sort of thing
that decimal does.It's horrible.In dozenal, it doesn't happen.Let's do something else.Let's do a quarter.A quarter of 12, a quarter of
do, is 3 out of do, whichwould be 0.3.1/2 would be 6 out of
do, which is 0.6.If you want to do 1/6, that
would be 2 out ofdo, which is 0.2.Suddenly, all these become
much simpler.You can see now why
they like it.Suddenly, all those horrible
things that happen in decimaldon't happen in dozenal.If we had been born with six
fingers on each hand and thisis the system we have learnt,
and then I came to you andsaid, no, I've got an idea,
let's not use base 12, let'suse base 10, you would
laugh in my face.Why would you use base 10?It's not as good.Now, naturally, we actually
count in twelves, andhistorically, weights and
measures were in twelves.So you would have
feet and inches.12 inches to a foot.And currency was counted in
twelves as well, because itwas naturally made dividing by
half, dividing by thirds, anddividing by quarters
and sixths.Much more easy and much more
practical, and that's thesystem we had.Then in the French Revolution,
the French got obsessed withdecimalizing everything.They wanted to make weights and
measures easier to use, sothey wanted to decimalize it,
divide it into 100 because weuse the decimal system.Now, they had a choice.They could have decimalized
everything, or they could havechanged the way we counted
from 10 to 12.If they had done that, they
could have kept all theweights and measures the same
and all the calculations wouldhave been as easy to do
in dozenal as theyare today in decimal.Now, they chose to make things
metric and keep the system.Maybe they made the
wrong choice.In fact, in the French
Revolution, they went so madwith decimalization that they
had a decimal week, they had adecimal calendar, and a
decimal clock as well.They did that for a few years.Didn't take off.BRADY HARAN: What would pi be?Would pi be the same?JAMES GRIME: So, if we're
talking about serious maths,something like pi, it would look
a lot different, and itwould involve these dek symbols
and el symbols.And if we look at it, it looks
weird and unusual.But if you were born with this
system, it would be fine.It would be normal.There's no significant
difference in the mathematics.The real difference this would
make would be to just yourregular life.It might make arithmetic easier
for children as well.BRADY HARAN: But the one thing,
I guess, people aregoing to say is, when you're
very small and learning aboutnumbers, your fingers and your
hands are a really usefullearning aid.You'd be taking that away from
children right at the start.JAMES GRIME: Well, to answer
that, there are some culturesthat still use base 12.And what they do is
they count on thesegments of your fingers.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, dek, el, do.Just as easy to use.MATT PARKER: How many
hours do you want?So the next one, let's say we
did 3 to the power of, to thepower of, arrow, arrow, arrow,
or whatever you wantto call this, 3.That is equivalent to 3 to the
double to the double to the 3.
