we have seen previously that anglebisectors and perpendicular bisectors oftriangles meet at one single point dothe medians of a triangle meet at onesingle point two let's draw a triangleto understand what medians are look atthe triangle ABC assume we had point Don segment BC such that B D is equal toD C it means D is the midpoint ofsegment BC the segment BC is the sideopposite the vertex a a segment drawnfrom a vertex to the midpoint of itsopposite side is called a median sosegment ad is one of the medians oftriangle ABC similarly if E is themidpoint of segment AC then segment B Eis another median of a triangle now wehave to see if the median from Point Cpasses through this point so if F is amidpoint of a B the segment CF is thelast median of this triangle and we cansee that it passes through that point wecan say that all the medians areconcurrent they meet at one single pointlet's say they meet at Point G thispoint where all the medians of atriangle meet is called a centroid ofall the centers of a triangle thecentroid has the most number ofapplications in real life suppose youhave a pencil on which you wish tobalance a triangular shaped cardboardyou will observe that there is exactlyone point at which this will happenthere is only one point at which it willbe balanced and that point will be thecentroid of that triangle it will alwaysbe balanced at the centroid this pointis also referred to as the center ofgravity basically all the mass of thisobject is concentrated at this onesingle pointwhat if we want to hold that piece ofcardboard using a string such that itdoes not tilt in any direction againthat will happen at just one singlepoint which is called the centroid doesthe centroid always lie inside thetrianglethis recording from math open-roof commwill help us understand that to changethe shape and the size of the trianglelet us try moving the vertex a around nomatter where it is moved the centroidalways lies inside the triangle even ifwe try moving vertex B it will remaininside and it's the same case withvertex C actually it is kind ofintuitive if we look at our previousexamples if we want to balance thecardboard at a point which is thecentroid of course it cannot lie outsideit will always lie inside the trianglethere is another interesting conceptabout the medians which we will see inthe next video
