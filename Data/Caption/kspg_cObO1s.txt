we have seen how we could calculate thevolume of cuboids so to generalize theformula for the volume of a cuboid weconsider a cuboid of dimensions L B andH the length breadth and the height thevolume of a cuboid is equal to the areaof the base multiplied by the heightarea of the base is L multiplied by Bthe height is H so the volume will be lvh product of the length breadth and theheight we also know that a cube is aspecial case of cuboid where in all itsedges are equal this is a cube with alength of each of its sides equal to sunits it is a cuboid in which L is equalto B is equal to H which is equal to itssite which is s unit area of its basewill be s squared as it is a square andits height is s units so the volume ofthis cube will equal s square multipliedby s which is s cubed look at theformula of the volume in both casesthree lengths are multiplied that'sprecisely why the units of volume arealways cubedyou
