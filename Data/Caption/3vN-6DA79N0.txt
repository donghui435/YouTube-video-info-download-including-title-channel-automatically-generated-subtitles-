okay in this video I want to talk aboutcompound interest for its compound inmore than once a year and basically theformula you have to remember is it saysthe amount you have accumulated if youstart with the principal again this iswhat you go to the bank with for examplethat your principal or starting amountit says you take your APR divide it by nadd that to 1 and again represents thenumber of compounding per year and Y isgonna represent the number of years okayso I'm gonna talk about how where thisformula comes from briefly and then justdo a couple of real simple examples withit nothing nothing at all crazy sosuppose you start with $100 at an APR of12% compounded quarterly and we want toknow how much you have after one yearand maybe after two years so again Isaid that this is the formula but let'sjust see if we can't kind of play withit and see where it comes from a littlebit otherwise I think it's really justplugging numbers in for the most partand hopefully you have a calculatorotherwise it'll be a little tediousthese computations the idea is if we'regetting an APR of 12% so 12% is 0.12okay so this is our APR what's gonnahappen is every three monthsokay so again quarterly means everythree months or four times per yearwhat's gonna happen is every threemonths they're not gonna actually giveyou 12% what they do is they take thatAPR and they divide it by the number ofcompounding x' per year so instead ofgiving you 12% what they do what they'regonna do is they're gonna tack on threepercent four separate times okay this isactually better than giving interestannually at just 12% you'll actuallyfind out that your your interest yourthe amount of interest that you earn isgonna be a little higher than 12 percentwhen you start compounding morefrequently than once a yearokay so this is kind of one of the keyideas at the beginning to make sureabout so okay so if we just want tostart computing these values a littlebit it says at the end of three monthsI'm gonna have my starting principal of$100 okay it says I take one plus and Itake my APR and divide that by n whichin this case is 4 so forget about theformula for a second let's just thinkabout intuitively what we would have todo to calculate our the amount thatwe're going to get so this will be 100times one point zero three which issimply going to be a hundred and threeokay so at the end of three months I'vegot a hundred and three dollars in therenow at the end of six months what'sgonna happen is I've now got myadditional a little bit of money insteadof having a hundred dollars earninginterest now I have a hundred and threedollars earning interest again if Imultiply that by one point zero threelet's see what we get hereokay so this is 106 point zero nine andagain notice we could simply rewritethis actually as 100 and we've taken oneplus our APR divided it by the number ofcompounding x' which is 4 and now we'vesimply squared that number so we took ahundred and we multiplied it by onepoint zero 3 and then we multiplied itby another one point zero 3 that's whatall this really says okay at the end ofnine months we're gonna have our newamount our 106.9 again just multiplythat by 1.03 let's see what we get hereso this is gonna be 109 27 again wecould write this as 100 times 1.0 threeraised to the third powerlastly we'll take our 109 point 27 we'llmultiply that by one point zero three togive our final amount pretty tediousstuff for sure doesn't exactly get myheart racing here so 112 55 and again wecould write that as our startingprincipal one plus our APR divided bythe number of compounding x' which inthis case was 0.03 raised to the fourthpower okay so that's basically wherethis formulas coming from if we'recompounding in x over y years that'swhere the exponent end times y comesinto it so to answer our second questionif it says how much would you have atthe end of two years well at the end oftwo yearsall I do is use my formula so it saysthe amount accumulated is the principleone plus the APR divided by the numberof compounding x' n times y so it saysthe amount accumulated will be ourprinciple of one hundred dollars oneplus our APR which is twelve percent or0.1 two divided by the number ofcompounding x' which is four again thesame number of compounding x' times thenumber of years which will be two so itsays now we just have to compute onehundred times one point zero threeraised to the eighth power again whenyou compute these make sure that you dothe exponent first otherwise you'll getsomething bad it'll be really big makeyour computer or calculator probably cryand won't give you a good answer so ifyou get something nonsense there'sdefinitely a reason so if you do theexponent first and then multiply this bya hundred I am getting the value 126 andlet's round off to the nearest penny Iget 68 okay so and that seems like avery reasonable amount of money to haveafter two years at this interest rate soall right again nothing real heavy I'mgonna do another one it's a little morecomplicated using this formula so feelfree to take a look at that if you havequestions or comments feel free to postthem in my first video the one talkingabout deriving compound interestannually I go a little more in depth Ithink I go a little slower if you needto see that but I assume you've probablytaken a look at that one maybe alreadyso I sped it up a little bit on this oneso again just a different little formulato remember nothing again just nothingreal crazy though otherwise so alright Ihope this helps and good luck out there
