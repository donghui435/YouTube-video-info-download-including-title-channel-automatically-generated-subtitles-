let's understand a simple yet a verypowerful concept think of all the primenumbers you know 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 and soonobserve them closely to be more preciselook at this part all these primenumbers apart from two are odd numbers 2is the only even prime numberthis concept is simple and very usefullook at this question 2 prime numbersgreater than 20 were added to get an oddnumber is that true or false if weweren't familiar with this concept wewould probably have worked with a fewexamples to find out we would have tried23 + 29 31 + 37 and so on with theconcept above we can be sure that anyprime number greater than 2 will alwaysbe odd so the two prime numbers greaterthan 20 will also be odd and what willadd plus odd result in as we have seenbefore the sum of two odd numbers willresult in an even number so thisstatement is false we did not reallyneed to try out examples to find outusing this concept we could in like afew seconds easily say that odd plus oddis even the next question woulddefinitely classify as one of myfavorites in this topic we are giventhat the product of a and B is 14 and weare expected to find the value of B thisbeing a data sufficiency question we aregiven two statements statement one saysa and B are prime numbers and statement2 says a is an odd number the firstthing we should understand is that thisis a value question we need to know ifwe can find just one particular valuefor B the answer can be aC D or E a would mean only statement oneis sufficient we would mean onlystatement two is sufficient C wouldanswer if the statements together aresufficient B if either is sufficient andE if we are not given enough informationtry doing it yourself and see if you getthe correct answerokay let's understand statement onefirst when you are looking at statement1 do not look at the other statement aand B are prime numbers a can be 2 and Bcan be 7 both are prime and the productis 14 so can we say that B is 7 maybenot as a can be 7 and B can be to bothare prime and their product is 14 astatement 1 gives us two possible valuesof B it is not sufficient so a is notthe answera statement 1 is not enough either beingenough is also not an option D also isnot the answer we have cut down ouroptions to be C or E let's look atstatement 2 in isolation we are toldthat a is an odd number remember don'tlook at the statement 1 while you'relooking at the second one a can be 1 andwe can be 14 a is odd and their productis 14 a can be 7 and B can be two a oddand product 14 any other possibilitiesfor be using statement 2 of cause yes acan be 11 and B can be 14 by 11a is odd and product is 14 don't forgetfractions when you are substitutingvalues so statement 2 gives usinnumerable values for B it's notsufficient B is also not the correctanswer it's C or E now let's look at 1 &2 together a and B are prime numbers anda is an odd number the only option thatworks is a equals 7 and B equals 2both are prime and a is an odd number soC is the correct answer
