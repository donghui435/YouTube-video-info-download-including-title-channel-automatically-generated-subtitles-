in this video we're going to look at howto find a weighted mean now this isslightly different than a normal mean inthat a certain weight gets worked intoall of our data points to be a littlebit more specific here's what a weightedmean is and a weighted mean we look fora mean of each value when it ismultiplied by some sort of weight and wecan use the following formula to help usout in this formula you can see each ofthese little x i's is a data point andthese Wis are the weights so all one getmultiplied by a weight now we'redividing by the sum of all the weightsthat way we get our mean to see exactlyhow this works let's look at an exampleso according to a certain teacher they'dlike to grade their class on a weightingsystem this means that every category intheir class has a different weightassociated with it so their homeworkgrade weight is 25 quiz grade weight is30 test weight is 10 and the final examis 35 what the weights tell us is thatthe final exam counts for quite a bitand sort of the quizzes but looks likesince the weight on the test is verysmall that doesn't count for a whole lotso using these weights as suppose wehave a student who got an 88 on theirhomework 71 on their quiz 97 on theirtest and a 90 on their final exam we'regoing to find their average score ortheir weighted mean according to theteachers weighting scale so let's goahead and do that we need to take eachof the students scores these are likeour data points and multiply them bytheir respective weight let's see theygot a 25 weight for the homeworkcategory so 25 times 88 we've got aweight of 30on 71 weight of 10 on 97 and a weight of35 on 90 so every single data point ismultiplied by a weight now we need toadd up all of our weights to see what weneed to divide by 25 and 30 is 55 65 and35 so we need to divide by 100 whenwe're done let's grab our calculatorsand quickly add this upall right so on the top 8450 and all ofthis is being divided by 100 so it showsthat our students average score is aneighty four and a half now this kind ofmakes sense in the context of thestudents actual scores because you cansee that their quiz grade is quite lowand the quizzes have a prettysignificant weight on them so eventhough they're doing really good intheir tests and their final exam it'snot helping out as much as it needs tobecause the test is only worth a weightof ten so remember when looking for theweighted mean take your data points andmultiply them by their weight and divideby the total weight
