at a scatterplot and try to understandyou know what exactly is correlationwhat does it refer to and you know howdo we find out what exactly it is sofirst of all here's some terminologythat applies to correlation it could bea positive correlation it can be anegative correlation it could be nocorrelation and basically what it is iswe're plotting some points okay theseare scatter plots and we're trying tofigure out if we were trying to draw aline of best fit you know would thatline have a positive slope meaning goingup to the right would have a negativeslope meaning going down to the right orwould it be relatively no correlationthen if we want to refine it further wecould say well that's a strong positivecorrelation what that means strongpositive is the points are very you knowwell aligned okay like in a straightline so that if you were to draw thatline of best fit it would come very veryclose to hitting all of those pointsthat's a strong positive and if it wasyou know the points were in an almost astraight line and it was trending downwith a negative slope that would be astrong negative and then of course aweak positive means yeah it's generallygoing up but you know it's not reallythe points aren't really close to beingin a perfectly straight linesame thing with weak negative so let'ssee if we can classify these ones hereand at the end of the video what I'mgoing to also do is I'm going to showyou on the calculator how to actuallyfind out what that our value is okaythey use the R to represent thecorrelation coefficient and I'll showyou how that works as well now the otherthing I want to mention is that when youtalk about our values or correlationcoefficients it's on a spectrum fromnegative one to one negative one meansthat it's a negative correlation it'sgoing down to the right but that onemeans that the points are perfectly in astraight line okaysame thing with positive when they'reperfectly in a straight line okay but ifit's closer to the middle here at zerowhether it's a negative point one orpositive point one the closer it gets tozero zero means like there's relativelyno correlation there's not a patternit's not really going up to the rightit's not really going down to the rightso basically as you get further to theends of the spectrum towards negative 1or positive 1 the better the points arealigned in a straight line so let's takea look so this first one here what wouldyou say is it a positive negative andwould you say it's a strong pausestrong negative or weak positive weaknegative well if I should draw a line ofbest fit it looks like you know it'strending down to the right okaydefinitely maybe kind of like you knowit's okay me I would say probably a weaknegative okay for this one a weaknegative correlation so it's gonna havea negative our value but it might besomewhere around you know negative 0.5or negative 0.6 okay this one here youcan definitely see it's trending up tothe right that's going to have apositive correlation coefficient okaypositive our value again you know it'spositive but it's going to be like maybeyou know positive 0.5 or maybe apositive 0.6 okay just estimating nowthis one you can see these points arealmost perfectly in a straight linetrending up to the right positive slopethis is definitely gonna be a strongpositive correlation the r-value isgonna be very very close to one if notexactly positive one right and then thisone you can see it's hard to really tellif I was trying to let draw a line ofbest fit what I draw it going up to theright where they go out drawing it downgoing down to the right if there'sreally relatively no correlation so thiswould be no correlation and it would bevery very close to zero okay if not zeroso that's an overview of just how thecorrelation coefficients now it workslet's go ahead and take a look at thegraphing calculator and I'm going toshow you how exactly to calculate whatthat our value is when you're you knowdrawing a line of best fitokay here we are with the ti-83 graphingcalculator and you can do the same thingon the ti-84 and some of the othergraphing calculators but let me show youhow this works we're going to try tofind that correlation coefficient andwhat the first thing want to do is goover here to stat for statistics rightso stat and then what you want is editenter and what I'm going to do is I'mgoing to arrow up to the top of theselists and I'm just going to hit thisClear button okay when you do that andarrow down it's going to clear off thatlist same thing over here list one go upto the top hit clear and then arrow downso what we're to do is we're going toput the x coordinates in list one in theY coordinates and list two and I'vewritten down some points here for us solet's let's just go ahead and reduce Ohnegative 3s for the X negative 1 2 3 & 4and then if I arrow over here for the Ycoordinates let's see I've written downnegative 2 negativeone let's see negative 1 1 & 4 okay sonow what you want to do is go back tostat over here stat arrow to the right 4calculate and what we want is we want alinear regression number 4 okay see it'slike linear regression like y equals MXplus B like a slope intercept form ofthe line enter okay and you can see whatit's giving us here now is this ourvalue 0.8 to the equation of our line isgoing to be y equals 0.67 X plus anegative 0.476 okay so you can put the aand the B and for the equation there butlook at that our value point 8 2 so thatmeans it's a positive correlation it'sgoing up to the right and it's prettyclose to 1 which means that you knowthis is a pretty you know this is apretty good so what I'm going to do isI'm just going to write down theequation that line which is y equals 0.8to 6 let's see oh that's the R value sowe've got let's see y is equal to let'ssee point six seven six X plus negativepoint four seven sixokay so what we can do now is let's goback to y equals okay and let's put thatequation in so 0.67 6x okay - point fourseven six and then I'm going to go backto let's see I'm going to go back tothis second stat plot and see how it'soff I'm going to turn that plot on okayon because we want to see those datapoints and I'm going to select this onehere okay and let's go back to graph uphere in the upper right hand corner soyou can see there's those are our datapoints there's our line of best fit andso you can see some of these points youknow they're a little bit of a distanceaway from you know the line but you cansee it's definitely trending up to theright that's why we have a positive ourvalue of was about 0.8 and but not toobad so definitely definitely acorrelation there definitely positivenot exactly perfectly one where they'rein a straight line but but very you knowpretty close to it so that's how you doit the one last thing I want to mentionis sometimes when you're working withthis correlation coefficient somecalculators they don't automaticallygive you that our value what you have todo is you have to go down here tocatalog C here right above the zero sowhat you'd want to do is select secondand catalog and what you want to do isyou want to arrow down to Diagnostics soI'm just going to hit the letter D heresee if I can find it D right there andthen what you want to do is arrow downto diagnostic and you want to turn thaton see what it says diagnostic offdiagnostic on enter enter now when yougo to do this linear regression it'llmake sure to give you that our valueotherwise sometimes if you change thebatteries or when you first get thecalculator it won't give you that ourvalue that's to turn that diagnostic onso subscribe to the channel check outmore math tutoring videos on my youtubechannel Mario's math tutoring and I lookforward to seeing in future videos
