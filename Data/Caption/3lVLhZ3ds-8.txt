hey everybody welcome again to anotherone of my math videos in this video I'mgoing to teach you how to dividepolynomials using synthetic division andit's important to know that syntheticdivision can only be used when there isa first degree X in the denominator thatmeans that there is a 1 exponent abovethe X in the denominator that is theonly case in which synthetic divisioncan be used so it's important to knowthat so let's just get started with thisexample and step number one I havewritten for you on the left and thegreen it says place the coefficients indescending order so notice how we have aX cubed and we have a X and then we havea 8 constant you have to place thecoefficients in descending order so ourgreatest power is a 3 for our greatestexponent M is a 3 and the coefficient infront of that X cubed is a 1 ok so sincethere is a coefficient of 1 in front ofthe X cubed I'm going to put a 1 insidethe boxnotice how we get skipped from an Xcubed to an X and there is no x squaredterm because there is no x squared termsor 0 x squared terms I'm going to put a0 as my next coefficient okay notice thecoefficient in firm the next highestterm which is our X is negative 11 soI'm going to put a negative 11 andfinally our last coefficient is positive8 so now what we want to do on theoutside is place the opposite number inthe denominator so notice how we have anegative 3 in the denominator so on theoutside we want to place a positive 3so moving right along now we can getstarted with our synthetic division andour first step with synthetic divisionis you want to just bring down the firstnumber which is 1 so we just want tobring that number down and write itbelow the lineso our next step is that we want tomultiply this 3 by the 1 and then wewant to place it below the 0 so 3 times1 is 3 so we want to place a 3 0 0 nowwe need to add the numbers in the secondcolumn so we have a 0 and a 3 so 0 plus3 gives you a positive 3 and now we needto repeat this process all over again sowe want to do is we want to multiplythis positive 3 with this 3 and we wantto place it right below the 11 I'm sorrynegative 11 so positive 3 times positive3 gives you positive 9 and now we needto add the numbers in the third columnwe have a negative 11 and a positive 9negative 11 plus 9 is just negative 2and now we just need to repeat theprocess just one last time now we needto multiply this 3 by the negative 2 andwe need to place it right below the 8the 8 so positive 3 times negative 2will give you a negative 6 and if we addthe numbers in the last column we havethe positive 8 minus 6 gives us positive2 so this last number after you're donewith the synthetic division then I'mgoing to circle in red is your remainderit's always going to be your remainderso your final answer always starts onedegree less than in your numerator sosince we have a highest degree of 3 inour newReiter since we have a three exponent istheir largest our answer is going tostart one degree less so it's going tostart with a degree of two okay and thecoefficient that goes in front of the xsquared term is the first coefficient inour synthetic division so since ourfirst coefficient is one a one goesbefore the x squared term our next termis an X and since our next termcoefficient in our synthetic division isa three we have a coefficient of threein front of the X since our nextcoefficient is a negative two then ournext coefficient is minus two andfinally we have our remainder and sincewe have a remainder of two you alwaysput that in the numerator of a fractionand you always put what you're dividingby since we're dividing by X minus threethe debt in the and this is our finalanswer so I hope this video helped youunderstand synthetic division a littlebit better if you need any extra helpwith the live tutoring or homeworksolutions please go to my website atmath meeting comm once again napping umalso if you like the way I teach and youlike seeing my videos please subscribeto my youtube channel once again thankyou so much for watching my video andtake care
