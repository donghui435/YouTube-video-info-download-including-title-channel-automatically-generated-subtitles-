and what our goal is is to solve forwhat X is but the way that we do that iswe try to isolate or get the radical byitself so what I'm going to do is I'mgonna try to get the square root of xplus 1 by itself by working from theoutside in and doing the oppositeoperation so I'm going to add 2 to bothsides okay to keep the equation balancedso that gives us 2 squared of X plus 1equals 8 I want to do the opposite ofmultiplying by 2 I'm going to divideboth sides of the equation by 2 so nowwe're left with square root of x plus 1equals 4 ok now what we're gonna do iswe're going to get rid of this radicalthis square root by doing the oppositeand that's 2 square ok both sides thesquare and the square root those cancelone another out we get X plus 1 equals16 and if we subtract 1 from both sideswe get x equals 15 now when you workwith radical equations sometimes you getwhat are called extraneous solutionsextraneous roots false answers howeveryou want to say it but what you want todo to make sure that this is actuallythe correct answer is to take 15 goahead and put it back into the originalequation and make sure that it worksbecause sometimes like I said you do getthis false answer so you have to checkyour answer so just make sure so this isgoing to be 15 plus 1 okay minus 2equals 6 so this is 16 square root of 16is going to give us 4 so that's 2 times4 and that's going to be 8 minus 2 andyou can see 6 equals 6 so yeah 15 isindeed the correct answer sometimes whatwill happen if this didn't work youwould just say there's no solutionsometimes when you solve these equationsyou get two answers and maybe one worksand one dozen or maybe they both don'twork or maybe they both do work butagain you just want to double check themin the original equation okay let's lookat an example B here here you can seethis doesn't look like a radicalequation like the original one that wedid but it isn't in fact a radicalbecause if you see this denominatorthat's really representing the cube rootof AX the quantity squared okay but whatwe're gonna do is we're just going towork from the outside in towards thisvariable by doing the inverse oropposite operation so we've got 3 X tothe 2/3 minus 2 equals 10 I'm going toadd 2 to both sides okay and then we'vegot 3 X to the 2/3 equals 12 I'm goingto divide by 3 okay because I'm tryingto get that variable by itself we've gotXthe two thirds equals four and then whatI'm going to do now is I'm going toraise both sides to the reciprocal powerso instead of the two-thirds power I'mgoing to raise it to the three halvespower like this and you can see when youhave a power to power you multiply it sothis is just going to give you X to thefirst which is what we wanted it to justX by itself but remember the denominatoris the root so this is saying the squareroot of four the numerator is the powerso that's raised to the third powersquare root of 4 is 2 and then 2 cubedis 2 times 2 times 2 which is 8 so E isgoing to be the answer to this problembut again let's just go ahead and put itback into the double check this is thecube root of 8 which is 2 2 squared is 4times 3 is 12 minus 2 is 10 so justremember the denominator is the root andthe numerator is the power so this hasbeen how to work with radical equationshow to solve them I'm gonna have anothervideo getting into some more challengingones and so you can check out that ifyou're interested subscribe to thechannel check out more math tutoringvideos on my youtube channelMyra's math tutoring and I look forwardto seeing the future videos
