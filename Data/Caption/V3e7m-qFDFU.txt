so here we have the matrix a which is athree by three matrix and we need tofind the determinant of this matrix aand there is a couple ways to find thedeterminant of a three by three matrixbut what I like to do is I like to copythe first two columns and place them tothe right of the matrix so that's whatI'm going to do right now I'm going totake this first column I'm going to copythis first column and I'm going to placeit to the right outside the matrix andnow I'm going to do the exact same thingwith the second column I'm going to copythe second column and I'm going to placeit on the right outside the matrix andafter we copy the first two columns andplace them to the right of the matrixnotice how we can create three diagonalsif we start at the top left part of thematrix we can create one diagonal we cancreate two diagonals and we can createthree diagonals and what we need to dois multiply all three diagonals sothat's what I'm going to do right nowI'm going to multiply the first diagonalwe have 4 times negative 1 which isnegative 4 negative 4 multiplied by 7 isnegative 28 now if we multiply thesecond diagonal we have negative 3 times2 which is negative 6 negative 6 times 1is also negative 6 now if we multiplythe third diagonal we have 0 times 2which is 0 0 times 5 is also 0 so now wehave multiplied all 3 diagonals goingfrom top to bottom and now we need to dothe exact same thing with diagonalsgoing from the bottom to top so I'mgoing to create my 3 diagonals from thebottom to the top here we have onediagonal here we have the seconddiagonal and here we have third diagonaland just like before we need to multiplythese diagonals together so that's whatI'm going to do right now you can startwith the first diagonal we have 1 timesnegative 1 which is negative 1 negative1 timeszero is equal to zero in a seconddiagonal we have five times 2 which is10 10 times 4 which is equal to 40 andthen the third diagonal we have 7 times2 which is 14 and 14 times negative 3which is equal to negative 42 and nowafter we have multiplied all thediagonals finding the determinant ofthis matrix is really easy the onlything that we need to do is take the rednumbers and then subtract all the greennumbers so that's what I'm going to doright now the determinant of matrix a isequal to all the red numbers so I'llplace all the red numbers in theparenthesis we have negative 28 we havenegative 6 and we have 0 and we need tosubtract all the green numbers so I'mgoing to place all the green numbersinside the parentheses we have a 0 wehave 40 and we have a negative 42 so nowthe only thing we have left is additionand subtraction so the determinant of ais equal to negative 28 minus 6 which isnegative 34 negative 34 plus 0 is justnegative 34 minus 0 plus 40 which isjust 40 40 minus 42 is negative 2 andnow we have negative 34 minus negative 2which is equal to negative 32 in onequick side note about the determinantbefore I finish this video thedeterminant is very useful when findingthe inverse of a matrix however if thedeterminant is 0 then the matrix doesnot have an inverse or you could say thematrix is invertiblesince our matrix a has a determinant ofnegative 32 negative 32 is not 0 so ourmatrix does have an inverse ormatrix is invertible
