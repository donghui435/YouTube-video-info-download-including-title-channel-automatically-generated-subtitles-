Hello, everyone!Now, my attention was drawn to a recent Facebook pollby a friend of mine.Now, usually I tend to avoid these polls.They either tend to be rather banal,like what day of the week is it,with opinion divided in seven different directions,or they tend to be rather obvious, likewho's better--Busted or McFly?With the answer obviously beingMcFly!But this was curious. The question was:Or to put it another way,What's the probability that you live in an odd-numbered house?Now, I'm going to give you a moment to think about that.What do you think it is?And, well--in the meantime,here's a picture of an orangutan and a kitten.[music plays]Right.So what do you think it is?What's the probability that you live in an odd-numbered house?Now you might have thoughtthat the probability was50/50.In other words, the probability is naught point five. [0.5]But it appears that the probability is slightly more than that,at naught point five oh two. [0.502]That means that you are slightlymore likely to live in an odd-numbered housethan in an even-numbered house.But how come?When my attention had been first drawn to this poll,there had already been a quarter of a million responses!250,000 responses,with the breakdown looking like this:
Odd: 125710
Even: 124653And you can see that the number of odd-numbered houseswas already starting to pull ahead by about a thousand.In fact, the proportion of odd-numbered houseswas already standing at naught point five oh two. [0.502]But, is this significant, or was it just down to chance?I mean, certainly, if I took a coin,and I tossed it 250,000 times,I would expect the number of headsto turn up about half the time--125,000.But there's no guarantee of that.You can get a run of good luckand end up wtih more heads than tails.In fact, it's even possible,although very unlikely,you can get 250,000 tails in a row.But, if you perform the experiment repeatedly,you will end upwith a bell curvecentering around the mid value, 125,000,with 95% of resultsturning up in the range124,500 to 125,500.That's the middle 95%.You may have heard of this asplus or minustwo standard deviations from the mean.Now on the other hand,5% of resultswill be outside this range.Now, these are going to be the more extreme results,but still perfectly normal.I mean, for example, if I perform the experiment twenty times,and I get one resultoutside that range,that will be as expected.Now the poll so faris outside this range.Now, that doesn't mean that the answer isn't 50/50.But it is evidence that there is a bias towards odd-numbered houses.Now, it doesn't confirm the bias,but it's just a failure to reject the ideathat there is bias.A couple of days later, the poll had reached 400,000 responses,with the breakdown now looking like this:
Odd: 211,803
Even: 209,264Now, that theoretical 95% intervalgets more narrow with more responses.The proportion of odd-numbered houses herewas still naught point five oh two. [0.502]So in fact, this was now falling even widerof the theoretical 95% interval.And if it was 50/50,I'd be expecting the opposite to happen.So why isn't it 50/50?Think about the number of odd-numbered housesin streets with an even number of housescompared with an odd number of houses.If your streethas an even number of houses,then the proportion of odd-numbered houseswill be 50%.It doesn't matter if your street contains 10 houses,or 50 houses,or a thousand houses.The proportion of odd-numbered houseswill be 50%.But that's not true if your street contains an odd number of houses.For example,if your street contained three houses--one, two, three--then two of those three houses will be odd numbered.If your street contained five houses--one-two-three-four-five--then three of those five houses will be odd numbered.The proportion of odd-numbered houses is slightly more  than 50%.And so, all together,the average is tending towardsa number greater than 50%.And that's due to streets that contain an odd number of houses.So, even though we can now see that the proportionof odd-numbered houses is going to be greater than naught point five [0.5],justifying why it appears to be naught point five oh two [0.502]is going to be more difficult.But, roughly speaking,assuming a typical street can range in size from one to a thousand,the average proportion of odd-numbered housescan be calculatedto be naught point five oh two [0.502].Now obviously, there's going to be exceptions to this.There's going to be streets that have more even-numbered housesthan odd-numbered houses.Or even streets that only have even-numbered houses.But by the same token,there's going to be exceptions in the other direction as well.There are going to be streets that have moreodd-numbered housesthan even-numbered houses.And I'm going to say that these exceptionsare either going to be insignificant,or they're going to cancel each other out.Either way,they're going to be drawing the proportion of odd-numbered housesback to naught point five oh two. [0.502]Now, credit for this goes to my friend Chris Draper,but apart from that,as usual,if you have been,thanks for watching.
