what's up good morning here today we'regonna do it call me the mathema lootedthe mathema Limpy if you need a problemI can fix it cuz I can't run let me askyou one thinggave up yeah very goodit was gonna felt like wind alright sothe purpose of today's lesson is toprove triangles congruent right andthat's we're gonna spend the next 20minutes doing yourself so we want toprove these two triangles congruentwhat does congruent mean real quickpeople the same completely identicalright right one of the ways of provingtriangles congruent is by this lawcalled a SA and we're going to talkabout it now so let's say right now howdo these triangles congruent yet no nothey're not okay so let's see this isthe red so now they have one congruentangle are these triangles congruent yetno because you can have triangles thatone congruent angle but their bottomsare all crazy you know and they're verydifferentso these triangles are congruent yetwhat about now they have one congruentangle and one congruent side now arethey congruent do you think yeahalmost almost almost they have onecongruent angle here it is in the redand they have one congruent side here itis in the green and let's do this nowthis is mark with light - okay now lookclosely they have one congruent anglethey have another congruent angle andthey have a side between them that'scongruent just like it's spelled now canyou guess are these two trianglescongruent now yes yes question pleaseokay I will never mindmm-hmm so yes these two triangles arecongruent and they're congruent by thelaw eh si what is a si stand for angleside angle very good so we could saythese two triangles if they haveanything less then they're not congruentthat's the point so let's try to let'sdraw two more so these are congruent bya s a next - all right John however youlike with them side by side make themlook like slightly non equilateral andso we ask are these triangles congruentJack no no question did you say thatthey from the a si is only for twotriangles well any triangles can becongruent with a si as long as they havethe a si relationship as in an anglecongruent beside congruent and anotherangle congruent and just like it'sspelled this is something that studentsmiss just like it's felt the S isbetween the two angles so check it outsee how the green one is between the twoangles here here that's a si right justlike it's spell now we're going to doanother one okay so these trianglesaren't congruent yet let's do this anglecongruent to this one I think you ruinno let's do this side again congruent tothis side they can grow and yet still nono now we're going to make themcongruent by a AAS so notice the side isnot between theangles so which side should it be do youthink it should be or security whichangle should it be should it be thisangle and this or the right one pleasein the back button right bottom rightthat's right so let's put them in youguys good job I'm glad you'revolunteering don't be afraid to be wrongseriously it's all good I'm wrong allthe timeit's too bad I'm a teacher not good umyeah so but I'm teaching you how to bewrong so that's part of me so it worksdarling hmmthat's fine never thought of that beforethat's cool so check it out two anglesthat are congruent there they are twoangles that are congruent and a sidethat's not between them this the sidethat is between them the side is notbetween the two angles so are thesetriangles congruent now yes bye hey heyyes okay any questions so we're movingon yes okay good so let's try some morelet's draw two triangles like this kindof back to back back to back all rightthe goal of this lesson and every lessonfollowing it will be to prove twotriangles congruent two or more as yousaid Cornelius so how's the joke I justmade that so are these triangles cangrow even though they're back to backyou know I they can brewing to eachother yet they're not they're not allright so let's see if we can startmarking them excuse the red yeahquestionoh if you prove only good plot oh youknow if you prove the two bottom sidesangle they eat this yeah um wouldn'tthat prove that it's congruentI do not enough talk to not enough yeahwell we'll walk through it what goodright now it appears that there'snothing congruent about these twotriangles it appears but the secret isthere is one thing that's congruentabout them so start to think about inthe back your mind so let's say if Isaid this angle was congruent to thisangle so now do they have an A or an Sshared hey you're good havin a sharednow let's do here now these areexplicitly 90 degrees each so do theyhave another a or s which one is it Heyokay so it looks like they have an A youhave another a so we need one more don'twe we need to simply need they come inthrees to need one more does anyone seethat there's another one in there hidingokay two people it's okay if you don'tkeep looking there's another one inthere hiding it seed another angle orside can you see it which one it isyes so is it the middle one this sidehere yeah why why is it you write nicelyboth sure if I'll share it yeah so isn'tthe goal to prove this trianglecongruent to this triangle and so forapproving this trinomial congruent tothis triangle we say okay well this sideI usually mark it with three so itstands up this side for the lefttriangle is the sameas this side for the right triangle sothey are these two sides are sharedthey're back to back so they have thesame any questions about that thisproperties then you know what it'scalled when you look at yourself in themirror you see your reflection yes soit's called reflexive property reflexiveproperty like if you were to say for acall this side a B you would say a B iscongruent to a B and this is called thereflexive property that's something youneed to learn reflexive property and theway I remember it is you're lookingyourself in the mirror a bee is lookingat its up in the mirror you know this islike Albert Baron Thal whatever Albertis looking at himself in the mirror okaywhy do I think about me don't youAlbert's looking at himself a mirrorsees this upon reflection and there isreflexive property it's a good way toremember yeah sure yeah same thingbecause that's the same line okay so noware these two triangles congruent yes bywhich Lockleys a si hey si that's rightand we can tell it's a si because theside is in between is between the twocongruent angles just like it's spelledthe sides between the two angles thatquestions okay all right good we aremoving along let's do another one ofthese back-to-back ones okay line comingdown okay are these triangles congruentyet no no they're not so let's do I wantto time it I know I want to introduce ita little at a timeokay what about now I think I'm ruinedout no no righthow many things do they share so far oneone two two two right they share oneangle and they share whatlike aside know why don't we do the signright now let's do it I think it's agood plan for you on your quizzes andtests just say immediately that thisside is shared and that's the same asitself so that you can get closer toyour goal please yeah what is the bottomline you said good question you'resaying one this be the same is that notnecessarily what if we had somethinglike this see that this side is not thesame as that so until we explicitly saythat this is the same as that we can'tassume that it is all right so that's agood thoughtthat's a good thought I'm sure manypeople think that it appears thatthey're the same rightoh I think this is the same page theyare but we can't say that right samewith this I think these are the samelet's say that they are we can't wecan't say that these are both 90 becauseit could be 91 and 89 no we can't saythat these are the same just like wecan't say these is we can't say it untilwe know please can't you see at themiddle of 90 because you have the tofollow me yes ed what if this is 89 and91 what if the two sides of the samething which two sides to bottom thesetwo angles not necessarily look I'm gladyou asked these two angles are the samethat's possible but that doesn't haveany influence on these two right so youguys these questions are good they'rereally going to help you get ahead youknow because you understand it from thebottom and the top so we can't assumeanything screwing until we can concludeit so so far we can only make twoconclusions the one that I told you thered one and the one that you told me theside that's equal to the side all rightand now let me ask you what would needto be the same now this is what a lot ofhomework assignments do what would needto be the same for these triangles to becongruent by as a a s I see a and icns please try isit fought on this one these two anglesthat's rightso they have to be 90 each becausethey're supplementary we see that we seethat we know they're supplementary theyhave to be 9 th so can you give us aexplanation your own words why now thatthese are the same that these trianglesare congruent IaaS you try why yeah whywhy did you say these well because thetwo sides the two angles are in sizeright they like and they has to be likeokay that's right and then what can youtell me about the side is it in betweenthem is it between the angles or notbetween them it's not it's not rightguys it's not just like this side is notbetween the angles here it is the sizenot between angles very good okay let'skeep goinghumph how far we have timewise CorneliusCornelius out on the dance well we're sogood we're making good time okay so whatabout we're doing two more all rightlet's do back-to-back and now are thesetriangles congruent you go a littlefasterno not yet what about now are theycongruent no not yetwhat else can we assume that Elizamiddle line what's that property call toplay reflexive Oh Rob Rob evaporateswhatever and that's great well it's anofficer absolutely whatever like okaywhatever that's a joke that neverhappened okay so are these congruent yetno no what if I said that this segmentis the same as that now are these twotriangles congruent by any of the rulesyou see above hey hey yes well our twosides the same or two angles the samethat's me 99these are sides right so if I were tomake lighters out of this what letterswith a spell be carefulyeah how about the other way aroundwould it be funny if I like I wrote thatand then like someone walked in I'd belike hey yes so any questions so here'sthe point why I brought this up it's putit back put it down again okaythis order or the other order right theother order they do not prove the chinewas accruing if you have this situationwe cannot conclude the triangle to beruined so you can do something like thisnot congruent not congruent by SSA SSAis not a valid triangle congruence oneplease right right we can write noconclusion we can write because there isno conclusion we can make specificallyexcuse me you know you're absolutelyright that's right that's rightI stand corrected that's I'm glad youdid that those great question sya mathis awesome just because these are SSAthese may be congruent but they're notnecessarily congruent that's that's avery good point I was wrong about thatthese two can be congruent there'snothing stopping them from beingcongruent but we can conclude that basedon SSA so we say no conclusion that'sright good job all rightone mo wah mo mo won mine oh it in colorChicagookay so um you guys several of you sendme emails last night saying can weplease do a proof today so I want tohonor that request and we'll do that Iwas looking around like was it yeahthat's a pungent teacher maneuver ofturning the class against each other youdo it in jail in the movie is seven nowforever remember okay so we want toprove these triangles congruent let's doit let's say in the given statementsreasons so be a the C okay so what doyou think remember the purpose of thisentire lesson as we do our last thingtoday is to prove triangles congruentwhat would be the proof proof statementplease try prove that what beat what isBCA a triangle guy triangle can we dothe a in the middle just for my purposeI like them okay cool so how about beBAC through the triangle BAC is iscongruent to it's congruent oh now ithas to be because it should be in orderin terms of it a be tryin yeah right seeit and top bottom and top bottom sothat's triangle DAC back and DACso we want to prove these two trianglescongruent what are the two ways welearned today approving driving screwinyes a si and AAF right so our goal is toget to one of these conclusions so let'sdo some given statements given we haveangle B is congruent to angle D that'sone given and we have AC the linebisects angle bad alright so there's ourgiven it's mark a little spaceseparation here so you can see we'reworking with okay I'm sorryokay so let's try to prove thesetriangles congruent by either AAS or asi let's go through one at a time angleB congruent to D let's mark the picturehey I need objections B D okay oh ofcourse this is the given or as somepeople like to say the given by a mapscreaming money walls are thin this isgood cuz it's a bathroomokay so this is the given that's givenfolks just in case yeah um alright arethese triangles congruent can we reachour conclusion yet no no okaywhat do you want to do what you want younext if there's a couple things you cando please I do AC on line AC yeah ohyeah line AC is congruent to line it asee you sure you want to do reflexiveright now yeah let's do itAC is congruent to AC I would do thattoo I like to get it out of the wayalright so we have AC is congruent toitself by what property mr. look in themirror man reflexive did reflexive propokay so let's mark the picture alwaysalways always mark the picture don't bethat student that doesn't market becauseif you mark it then you can see howcloser you are so I like to mark it withthree you're free to do so as well orwhatever you want okay so we can makeour conclusion now you have it do wehave itdot dot dot no you don't have it wedon't have it yet how many pieces are wemissing one two no question please allowthis we can here okay because it says ACfive sex angle right right which anglesyour right which is angle BCAand I'm so have you said that BCA and aCD so these do these two that's a verygood guess it's a very very commonmistake it's the top one and can youexplain why is the top one I'll explainwhy is the top one based on this givenI'll step below it because it um DAC isandcadr in the middle BAE right right rightyeah so BA what is being bisectedexactly BAE and what is BA D it's not atrianglewhat is BA D right now so wholly anangle right it's an angle so if an angleis being bisected bad is being cut inhalf that's what is she cut in halfmight be bad but less so that is beingcut a nap and we identified where anglethat is angle BAC is here in it okay andif angle ba D is being bisected by thisline so the question I said I'd like toask is what is being bisected we'll takein a second what will be bisected by sexba D so angle B ad is being bisectedinto two pieces so we have a questionhere yeah why can't you just say thedefinition of by back we will that's thereason but what's the statement nobodylike thatcuz that's the given yeah like I've thedefinition of angle bisector will behere but give me it give me a statementof congruence here you have one here youhave two oh by the way it's a good pointgood point what I also like to doespecially for beginners angle B'scongruent to angle D is that an S or ana a so maybe you can go like this foryourself it's not necessary but you'rewelcome to AC is congruent to AC is thatan S or an a s so make it go like thisto yourself and so we need one morepleaseright if angle be ad is being bisectedwe can conclude that angle BAC this oneand let's mark it with two now becausethis has one this angle is congruent towhat did you say love DAC and that'sthis one and now angle B ad has been cutin half and so in the back you said whatwould be the reason yeah of what kind ofbisector segments angles cupcakesvehicles anglescuz what is being bisected angle I heardthe word angle that's right definitionof angle bisector is this an S or an ahey hey alright there's a okay can wenow conclude that these triangles arecongruent yes why because that's whatthe given says AC bisects angle ba D weare trying to prove stuff about thesetriangles in order to state that theyare the same alright and so now can weconclude let me let me ask a moredifficult question what can we do nowless less direct out of the way here wego okay what what can we say nowlike get it right when the hands up Igot youI got what much I uh you can concludewhat you can conclude and off the mouthyou can conclude that triangle BAC - whydo I see a triangle triangle DD AC ACwhat is the law that allows you to dothat in this case moment the moment atthe end right yeah that's your neighborhey us please explain why becausethere's the angle in the bottom left theangle at the top and then the sharedline of AC and the line isn't in betweenthe two angles so it's not a set theline is not between the two anglesnotice these are the angle CCSthis would be the line between them thatneeds to be congruent but it's notcongruent the line outside the twoangles is congruent thus it's a a/spostulate okay questions please feelfree yes four triangles are always onlygoing to be four steps you know more orless I'm hesitant to answer thatquestion outright because it depends onwhat the given is but I will tell youthat you need to make three statementsof congruence that match these threeletters then you can prove thattriangles are congruent that's the goalthree statements of congruence eitherangles or sides the question anythingelse all right good thank you everyonegive yourselves a handokay okay bye say bye say bye I'll do ityeah
