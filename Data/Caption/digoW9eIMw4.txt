let's do a mental math test is thenumber 613 thousand two hundred andsixty one divisible by 11have you figured it out hi this ispressure Locker in this video I'll teachyou a math trick where you can testdivisibility by 11 in your head here'sthe trick starting from the first digiton the left you want to subtract and addevery other digit in the number thefirst digit is 6 so we will subtract thenext digit of 1 add the next digit 3subtract the next digit 2 then add 6 andfinally subtract 1 this is an easycalculation to perform and we get theanswer of 11 if the result from thisalternating sum is divisible by 11 thenthe original number is as well so 11 isdivisible by 11so we know the original number isdivisible by 11let's use this trick to do a couple ofexampleslet's do fifteen thousand two hundredand thirty seven in our heads wecalculate the alternating sum is two twois not divisible by 11 so we know theoriginal number is not divisible by 11let's do one one two two three threefour fourwe could take the alternating sum but wecan easily see every other digit cancelsout the digit before so we know zero isthe resultzero is divisible by 11 so the originalnumber is also divisible by 11 it's areally cool trick you can figure outwhether a number is divisible by 11 byperforming a simple calculation in yourhead and you don't have to actually dothe division and the reason the trickworks is thanks for watching pleasesubscribe to my channel I make videos onmathyou can get my books there's a link inthe video description catch me on myblog mind your decisions which you canfollow on Facebook and Google+ you canalso follow me at pressure Locker onTwitter Instagram and Tumblr and you cansupport me on patreon
