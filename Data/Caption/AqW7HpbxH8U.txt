okay with a very interestingphilosophical point right now thequestion at hand is is it true thatevery fraction when converted to adecimal falls into a repeating patternthe answer turns out to be yes and beingkind of see why right now here's example6/7 we had in the previous lesson thatwe saw that we saw the number 6 with allthese different numbers 1 exploding withthese different remainders which gotunexploded now it's remainders domainit's a remainder for the remainder of 5we were made of 1 remainder 3 remain ortwo matters 6 remember for the remainderof 5 so the remainder start repeating soas soon as they remain to startrepeating we know we're in a repeatingpattern our answer will repeat as wellso the question is is it true when I doa fraction problem converting a decimalthat I'll get repeating remainders nowthink about the remainders but I'mdividing by 7 I will never see aremainder of 7 there'll be means therewas a group of 7 I should have collectedon no see remainder of 8 unless you'remade of 9 they're the only remainingI'll ever possibly see when divided by 7our remainder by the one or two or threeor five four or five or six not seven oreight and so on I might see a remainderof zero I didn't happen to this time butthere's only seven possible remainders Icould see when dividing by 7 0 1 2 3 4 5and 6 grandso that means as I do my divisionprocess so there's only a finite numberremainders and I'm trying to thisprocess for as long as I can I musteventually repeat a remainder in fact werepeated the six right off the bat so isROP remainder that means I'm in a cycleI've got a repeating decimal patternokay now when we did one quarter weactually got a repeat remainder of 0 wego 0.25 we could figure that out theremainder of 0 which led to a remainderof 0 which led to remainder of 0 itfellow's own little small cycle so therewas a repeating remainder as well soeven 1/4 is a repeating decimalrepeating zeroes after a while and whatwe did 1/3 is still enter at the sameremainder right away remainder 3remainder 3 remainder 3 so the foursroom repeat remain at once it's in acycle if I did a number like 3 13th mymother brought up even worse than thisone but we can think our way through itas I draw 3 dots and look for groups of13 I know the remainderplus BC could be 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 56 7 8 9 10 11 or 12 but we're not serum8 of 13 we're not serum 8 of 14 I'm notsuper made a this.d and so on there'sonly a finite number of possibleremainders I will get to so as I playthis game though I have to eventuallyrepeat a remainder I can't keep doingdifferent remainders there's only 13possible remainders I've got a speciallykept the same remainder I had before andso the hero repeat remainder it meansI'm in a cycle we've just proven everyfraction when converted to a decimal hasa repeating pattern there may berepeating zeros or greeting pad likethis but every decimal has refractionhas a repeating decimal expansion whoabecause this is deep so I'm going toit's so deep on a vital words everyfraction has a repeating now you get tosee my two atrocious handwritingrepeating decimal expansions all rightbecause we're repeating zeros like 1/4or 1/2 on 8th or something or could berepeating blocks like this but has arepeating decimal expansion this is deepbecause what it says now suppose I gaveyou a decimal that didn't have arepeating decimal expansion did not havea repeating pattern of any kind thenthat means that number cannot be afraction now people often call fractionsrational numbers like a ratio of twowhole numbers so number it's not afraction would be called irrational andI'm going to write for you to write downfor you right now an example of anirrational number we can now prove atthis very moment that irrational numbersactually do exist here's one it's points1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0and so on this number now it has apattern it's so near the pen but youknow what this pattern is you can figureout what the millionth digit is going tobe all the two millionth digit is goingto be so you know what this numberactually is you can figure it out but itdoesn't have a repeating pattern there'sno repeating cycle going on in whichcase this is some numbers on the numberline it's just bigger than one tenthcannot be a fraction it has delivererrepeating pattern there was not afraction this is our veryexample of an irrational number if itwasn't it drives me kind of crazy as ateacher a lot of books say that we allknow that pi for example is anirrational number the screw to is norash number we don't actually provingthose things as hard some books mightprove the square root of 2 is actuallyirrational doesn't have a repeatingdecimal but not pi pi r is very hard toprove that took mathematicians twomillennia to figure out how to provethat pi actually was an irrationalnumber is not at all straightforward butwhat I love about what we've just donenow dots and boxes where you can seeevery fraction that has must have arepeating decimal expansion thereforeany number you write down that does nothave a repeating this expansion must bean example for number that's not afraction we have a first example here ofan actual irrational number that we cansee and own for ourselves brilliant infact your term write down anotherexample of an irrational number isn'tthis grand
