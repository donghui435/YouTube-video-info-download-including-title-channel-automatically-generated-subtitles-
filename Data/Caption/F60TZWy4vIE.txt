okay welcome what I want to do is showyou how to solve this absolute valueequation absolute value of negative 5minus 4x plus 9 equals negative 40 nowwhenever we have absolute valueequations it's very important for us tomake sure that we isolate the absolutevalue sign okay because remember whenwe're solving for absolute value we'regonna find that positive and thatnegative value so it's really importantfor us to get rid of anything elsethat's outside perhapses value functionso the first thing you're going to do isI'm going to subtract this 9 to theother sidetherefore now I will obtain the absolutevalue of negative 5 minus 4x equals anegative 49 now from here in other caseswhere I'm showing is we can take ourabsolute value and set this equal to ourpositive and our negative value of ouranswer well it comes into a problem thatwe see right here is something I'mnoticing is I'm having the absolutevalue of some number we don't know whatX is equals a negative number and thatbecomes a problem because if we look atit you cannot have the absolute value ofsomething equal a negative number rightbecause let's say my number was you knowI don't know negative 3 well theabsolute value of negative 3 is stillgoing equal 3 the positive value of 3 isalways going to equal you know positiveabsolute value of 3 is also equal 3 soit doesn't even matter what's insidethis it doesn't even matter what'sinside this inequality when you solvewhen you get your any arms to inequalitywell if you stop when you get yourabsolute value function by itself andyou see that it's equal to a negativenumber you know that we're not going tohave a solution and again I'll remindyou the reason why is you can't havethere's no such thing as an absolutevalue of anything equaling a negativenumber you know absolute value of x isnever going to equal negative x so youcannot have this equal to a negativenumber so if you get this case just makesure you know that there's not going tobe a solution for the problem
