okay hello we've got very quick tutorialhere about radians and we'll go on totalk about our pan con sector area let'sget started one Radian lots of confusionabout this if I was to tell you what aRadian look like it's an angle and oneRadian is about that big that's aboutone Radian if you compare that somethingthat you're probably more familiar withif we draw one degree probably that'seven too big one degrees about that bigso there we go on degree one Radian itlike miles and kilometers are differentunits but it measures angles just thesame and how many degrees in a circle360 how many radians in a circle well aRadian comes about by taking one radiusand one radius mark sound if we goaround the circumference one Radian andso because we know that a radiant ifyou're familiar with sorry a radius ifyou're familiar with your circleformulas two pi times the radius goesinto the circumference so two pi radiansgo into the full circle this I think iswhere it gets a bit strange for somepeople because they tend to think thatthat's a formula it's not it's a numbertwo pi is about six point two eight andso what we're saying is about six pointtwo eight radians make the full circleit seems like a strange number to usefor a full circle 360 sounds tidier butactually as we'll see in lots offormulas and lots of mathematicalproblems it works much better for us soour equivalents what we can say two piabout six point two eight is theequivalent of 360 if we make the switchand sometimes little c is used perhapsthe easiest way to think about theswitch is if you think of 3.14 aboutRaelians 3.14 matches is equivalent toabout a hundred eight degree degrees soif I talk about PI by 2 radians I'mtalking about 180 degrees divided by twoI'm talking about an angle choose 90degrees if I talked about something likepi by 6 radians I would be talking aboutsomething equivalent to 185 at 6about 30 degrees if I wanted to talkabout 45 degrees well I'd be thinkingabout 180 split into 4 I'd be talkingabout PI / 4 radians so we canequivalence we have equivalence betweenradians and degrees just a differentmeasure nothing more we can still talkabout 1 Radian if we want and we canstill talk about 1.5 radius we don'thave to have pi in there pi is just acommonly occurring one because it fitsinto the full circle so 3.14 radians180 degrees if you want to make a switchbetween the two then what you can doexactly you could go from radians todegrees multiply by 180 divided by PIand if you wanted to go back fromdegrees to radians you shouldn't reallyneed to but if you wanted you couldmultiply by PI and divide by 180 but PIequivalent to 180 should be able to makea switch and the swap for you okay twoformulas very quickly what we can seewith Radian formulas let's give me twocircles and the idea that one Radianmarks how one radius can be very usefulindeed it means that we have a verysimple formula that if we have oneRadian let's say radius of fiveone Radian would mark out an arc lengthhere of one radius five and if we wenton another Radian we'd mark out anotherfive that very quickly tells us that thelength of the arc marked out is theradius times the angle if we mark outlet's say four radians and the radius is3 and then the arc length around theedge here the arc length is simply Rtheta radius times angle 12 if we areworking with let's say you're workingwith let's say PI and again it is PIthat tends to cause the problems withthese people get a little bit hooked upon the idea of Pi let's put a an angleand let's put a angles of that choosemaybe about 2 pi over 3 and if you'rethinking what's 2 PI over 3 or pi/180 PIover 3 62 of those about 120 degrees ifyou want to make a comparison so 2 PIover 3 radians let's call the radius 5what is the length of this arc here andthe length of that up there would beradius times angle in radians don't tryand do this in degrees it never worksand that will be 10 times pi over 3which is about 11 or something like thatif we put it in decimals but I'm gonnaleave it like thatvery good we could easily work out theflip side ofthat if we wanted we wanted the arclength around the other side it's theradius times the angle and the radius is5 and the angle well the angle 2 pi inthe full circle which means that we'vegot 4 PI over 3 and that'll be 20 PIover 3 would be my flip side and therewe gowe've got ourselves a nice simple arclength formula our next formula what wedo here let's take another couple ofcircles is we look at these and we saywhat about the area what about thesector area for these so it gives you athere's 1 Radian and what I want to knowis what is the area and your radius of 5the area of that sector is given by theformula 1/2 R squared theta a Radianformula once again nothing to do withdegrees put degrees in a pitch wrong sowhat have we got we've got 1/2 theradius squared times binding angle andbingo we have got 25 over to 12 point 5centimeters or whatever ice is squaredand we've got okay let's do one more tofinish off we have a sector and I'lltell you one good pie in this I'll tellyou that that's 2 radians I'll tell youthat that is for radius sector areafacts let me just go back one stepthere we go sector areaour radius squaredradius is for angle is 216 816 there wego 16 centimeters squared what if wewanted the area of this or the sectorwell easily enough sector area onceagain same formula radius still 4 butwhat is the angle well if this angle is2 on one side the full circle minus 2will be the other the full circle is sixpoint two eight minus the two we don'twant our 4 4 squared 2 pi minus 2 put itin your calculator if you want up therewe go centimeter squared we have got ourarea so there we gowe have two very simple formulas one arclength which is the radius times theangle in radians and secondly we havesector area which is a half radiussquared times the angle in radians neverin degrees and we have the equivalencethat PI radians is equivalent to 180degrees that is our conclusion forradians and simple Radian formula
