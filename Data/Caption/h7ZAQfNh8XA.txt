hey there everyone welcome back tomashup math my name is Anthony and thankyou again so much for joining me on thismini lesson just go ahead and getstartedhey everyone thank you for joining me onthis lesson where we are going toexplore the differences between similarand congruent so let's start off withthe question what does it mean when twothings are similar so let's start out bylooking at some pairs of everyday itemswe could probably describe each of thesepairs as being similar in some way couldbe based on shape color species functionor many other ways of describing thesethings but when it comes to geometry andlooking at mathematical figures ourdefinition of similar is much morespecific so let's go ahead and explorethat further by looking at the pair ofshoes notice that despite beingdifferent colors both images have thesame shape and this is still true evenwhen we change the size by making onelarger or smaller this is also stilltrue when we change the orientation byrotating them in one direction oranother so now as we discuss two figuresbeing similar we are going to focus onwhether or not they have the same shapeso here's another example of two similarfigures the two ghosts are differentsizes but they have the same shape evenif one is facing at different directionsand the other they still have the sameshapetherefore they are still similar nowwhen we say the same shape we have to bespecific in that the two figures areproportional to each other and we canillustrate this by overlapping the twonow from here we can clearly see thatthe figures are similar but since theyare not the identical same size we canalso conclude that they are notcongruent so now let's go ahead andexploreor why now moving forward let's keep thefollowing exploration questions in mindhow can I be sure that two figures aresimilar what is the difference betweensimilar and congruent can a figure beboth similar and congruent at the sametime and when is that cute ghosts goingto show up again so now let's go aheadand extend our thinking we have twofigures and we want to describe whetheror not they are similar and/or congruentto each other starting with similaritywe can see that these are both regularPentagon's so since they are the sameshape we can conclude that yes they aresimilar to each other and if we canvisualize overlapping the two figuresit's easy to see that taking the smallerPentagon and making it larger would makeit identical to the larger purplePentagontherefore they are proportional to eachother we can conclude here that thefigures are similar because they havethe same shape however we can see thatthese figures while being similarclearly are not the same size so we canalso conclude that the figures are notcongruent because they are not the samesize and we can add that both similarand congruent figures have the sameshape but congruent figures also havethe same sizeso let's quickly check out a few moreexamples look at the two figures shownhere in terms of them being similar Ican see that they are the same shape andthat they are proportional to each otherso we know that these two figures aresimilar however it is very easy to seethat they are not the same size so wecan also conclude that they are notcongruentlet's look at two more figures to seewhether or not they are similar we haveto change the orientation so thatthey're both facing in the samedirection which helps us to see that yesthey are the same shape they are bothregular hexagons we can also see byoverlapping the two figures that theyare identical in size so this pair offigures is both similar and congruentwhich leads us to the conclusion thatall congruent figures are similar butnot vice versa meaning that not allsimilar figures are congruent and thereis of course the possibility of asituation where two figures are neithersimilar nor congruent to each other canyou imagine what that might look like sonow you should have a betterunderstanding of the concepts of similarand congruent figures so keep these inmind as you continue to explore theseproperties and get into some moreadvanced problems so thank you again forchecking us out and I'll see you nexttimeall right so that's it for this lessonthank you again for stopping by I hopeyou found it helpful and if you didplease click that link below andsubscribe to our youtube channel leave athumbs up and a comment on this videowe could really use your support andalso don't forget to sign up for ourweekly newsletter when you join ourmailing list you get a free ebookdownload as well as weekly resourcestips insights and some cool contests andgiveaways as well so don't miss out onthat there's a link on this page you canclick to join the mailing list andthat's all you have to do so thank youso much again for stopping by and forall your support and I will see you allnext time bye
