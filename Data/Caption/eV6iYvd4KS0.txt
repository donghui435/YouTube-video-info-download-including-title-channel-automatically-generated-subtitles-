it's there we are well let me be alittle more mathematical and for thosethat want the true mathematical reasonsone negative times negative is positiveit's hidden behind the scenes in thisargument let me give it to you onebegins by listing the rules ofarithmetic that one thing should be truefor example we've already establishedthat we'd like to think that a times Bis the same as B times a we have areasonably that's true for positivecounting numbers we'd like to extendthat law to negative numbers as wellmany people like to believe thatanything times zero is also zero andthey also like to believe that you canexpand brackets what I mean by that ifI've got a times B plus C I could saythis is a c plus a whoops 8ap scuse meplus AC all right if you choose andthere was an if to believe these threerules then the math will force you tosay that negative times a negative is apositive number now these are the rulesare really at play behind my rectangleargument I just didn't make themexplicit but let me make it veryexplicit argument again let's look atnegative three times negative five andlet me show you directly those rules areforced me to say positive 15 okay firstof all this middle rule you have to sayif you believe it that negative threetimes zero is zerolet me write that zero in a funky waylet me write that as 5 plus negativefive that would still have to be zeroI've really not changed anything in theprevious line well if you believe inexpanding brackets you have to say atthe left-hand side of this line it'sactually negative three times five plusnegative three times negative five andit's still have to equal zero it's justthe same as the previous line well nowthere's my mystery object I'm quite surewhat that is but negative three timesfive five groups of negative three if Iswitch it around if you believe thatfirst rule there it isyou'd say this is negative fifteen plussomething scary is zero but look at thatwhat's the math telling me negativefifteen plus something is zero this guythat is this guy better be positivefifteenthese three rules of arithmetic if youbelieve to accept them force us to saynegative times negative is positive andthat's the true mathematical reason whythis is the case now if you choose notto believe these rules that's fine youwill invent a different kind ofmathematics in fact in the 1920s withthe development of quantum mechanicsfolks had to use a new system ofmathematics to let go of thiscommutative rule so in quantum mechanicssome of these rules are the windowthat's finds a new type of math and inthat math negative times negative isprobably not positive but themathematics we like to give our studentsin high school and in grade schoolthey like to say these rules are truewell as a pure logical consequenceoutcomes this consequence negative timesnegative is positive and that's thetruth
