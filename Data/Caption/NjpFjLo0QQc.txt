g'day and welcome to the tech mathchannel what we're going to be having alook at in this video is a way ofworking out the least common multiplenow first off what is the least commonmultiple well so we want to work out theleast common multiple for 72 and 60 theleast common multiple is the smallestcommon number that these numbers go intookay so we're going to have a look athow to do this now I have made anothervideo where we look at how about thisthis is a different method and it's areally good method for working at theleast common multiple of big numbers andit's fairly reliable in fact it's ahundred percent reliable so how doesthis one work now the first thing we'regoing to do is going to find this thingcalled the greatest common factor andthat's the hardest part of this doesn'ttake very long but what the greatestcommon factor is it's the biggest numberthat goes into both of these numbersokay so to say we were doing this theway we do it is we divide the smaller ofthese two numbers into the bigger one so72 divided by 60 this is their firststep is one with a remainder of 12 okaynow what we do is we look at theremainder here and we're going to carrythis on to the next stage so 12 is goingto be carried on to the next stage andthe smaller of these two numbers is alsogoing to be carried on to the next stageso 60 and 12 and we're going to have alook at now how many times we're goingto do a bit of repeat we divide thesmaller of these numbers into the largeone of these okay so 60 divided by 12the answer is 5 now that then there's noremainderand what this means are there's noremainderthis means it 12 I'll give it a circleis their greatest common factor okaythis is the biggest number that goesinto both 72 and 60 we looked at this ina different video did now how can thisbe used to work out the LCM though leastcommon multiple it's as follows and it'sreally really simple what we now do iswe divide 12 into one of these numbersis 12 this greatest common factor intoone or either 60 or 70 to the K so I'lldivide 12in 272 12 in 72 it goes six times okaysix times and what I do is I multiply itby the other one okay so six times 60now lace least common multiple is 360okay and it wouldn't have mattered Icould have gone 60 divided by 12 whichis five and times that by 72 and I wouldhave got the same answer okay so it'snot a bad little method for doing thisnow this is a actually a very accuratemethod to so we'll have a look at acouple more examples with this thatdon't panic straight away if you didn'tget that straight away don't worry giveyou a few examples of Seti right I'llgive you a nice easy example to go onwith that we'll have a look at right nowso say we wanted to work out the are theLCM of okay nice easy 145 and 20 and I'mgoing to put everything in order herebiggest number smallest number but ifyou don't have them in that order youcan rearrange them so they are so nowwhat do we do first we divide thesmallest into the largest number 20 into45 well that goes 2 times okay and thereis a remainderokay so 45 divided by 20 is 2 andthere's a remainder of 5 I move theremainder across now okay so 5 movesdown here and the smaller of thesenumbers moves down to the next stage 20divided by 5 okay that goes in fourtimes and there's no remainder so 5because there's no remainder 5 is ourgreatest common factor all right what dowe do now we divide this greatest commonfactor into our two original numbers towork out this least common multiple okso 5 into 45 okay 5 min to 45 goes 9times ok 9 3 times by 29 times 20 theLCM is 180 pretty cool right all rightnow you're going to be like ok that'snot necessarily always faster than theother method that we looked at in theother video and you correct about thisbut to reallymethod especially when you're startinginto Nastia numbers okay what about wedo something a little bit nastier whatabout I do say what's the lowest comethe least common multiple of okay let'sgo nasty here 1040 and 455 okay just togo a bit crazy I tell what after thisI'll Chuck on an even nastier example sowhat do we do divide the smallest intothe largest the smallest 1040 divided by455 okay so this divided by this we'regoing to get aa 2 with a remainder of130 array okay so what we'll do is wemove this remainder down to the nextstage 130 and I'm going to move thesmaller one of these downs 455 dividedby 130 okay how many times is thathappened ah goes in three times andthere's a remainder of 65okay still remain as having thatgreatest common factor yet we'll go onemore step I go another step when we goto 65 is going to move down the nextstage and 130 is going to move down tothe next stage of smaller out to another130 divided by 65 a that's two timesthere's no remainder so you don't thatmeans that means we're found ourgreatest common factor which is 65 okaythis is here GCF okay so 65 65 goes into455 seven times okay 155 divided by 65is seven times up by 1040 1040 and ourLCM is going to be seven thousand twohundred and eightysee that's where this methods reallycoolfrom working it with ridiculous numbersokaywhat about I'm going to give you themost nastiest example and most nastyit's the nastiest example that that yeahthat you might actually ever get okay sowhat about we do the LCM are fivethousand two hundred and two and twofour three one okay so you know you'regoing to do and divide one the othergoing to find this our greatest commonfactor first that one goes into that oneit goes in it goes in twice and there isa remainder of 340 what about you pausethis and give us a go and see here yougonow I've already started for you bitpause it so there you go all right okayso we're going to take the smallest onetwo four three one and I'm going todivide 340 into that okay how many timesdoes that occur so I'm just trying tofind a different color actually it goesin seven times and there's a remainder a51 okay is what's going to happen 51 isgoing to move down 340 is going to gothe next stage 340 divided by 51 you'regoing to get that what six times sixtimes okay that's going to be C 306 it'sgoing to be a remainder of 34 okay keepgoing34 is getting moved down 51 you're goingto see we're rapidly getting down to thestage we are we're getting somewherethough he's going to go in one time manalmost frighting the wrong pin one timeremainder 17 and 34 it's going to moveto this next stage divided by thisremainder 17 hey it's two times twotimes no remainderwe've got our GCF okay a greatest commonfactorokay so I'm going to see how many timesthis goes into one of these numbers whatabout 5202 divided by 17 if you do thatyou're going to get the answer of sothis one here divided by this one herein the answer of 306 times 2 4 3 1 okayand what this will be if you do thisyou'll get this are this least lowestcommon multiple of seven hundred andforty three thousand eight hundredninety-six okay and yes I did preparethat one earlier okay but I thought I'dshow you how this method can be usedokay now what do you think of thatmethod I'll tell you what is one hundredpercent accurate and the beauty of it itmeans you can if you miss out onsomething on the other method if youactually don't get a dent was thegreatest common factor you end up introuble but this one works all the timeanyway told you to think of this I thinkit's a great method you know it's seeyou next time bye
