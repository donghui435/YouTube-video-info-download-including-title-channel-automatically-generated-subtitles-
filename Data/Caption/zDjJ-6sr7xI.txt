a word that occurs often in logic is theword converse and it might sound alittle bit confusing but it's reallystraightforwardif you think about the converse of anif-then statement it's really justasking what is the reverse so thinkabout the offense statement if P then Qthe truth table for if P then Q is trueno matter what as long as you're not inthis one case where P is true and Q isfalse if P is true and Q is false thenif P then Q is not a true statement sowhen you're looking for the converse andyou have a statement that says if P thenQ the converse is exactly the oppositeits if Q then P so if we write down if Qthen P we may want to understand howthis looks like in terms of its truthtable so remember that there are fouroptions for P and Q being true and falseand if you think about it this is justanother if-then statementso let's look take a look anytime thatyou have Q true and P true here Q istrue and P is true so a statement istrue anytime that you have Q false andeat anythingthen it'll still be true so if Q isfalse and P is anything it'll still betrue so you get a true here and a truehere now the only time that if Q then Pis false is if you have Q true and Pfalse that's the only time you'll have afalse here so if P then Q is a verydifferent statement than if Q then P forexample if you think about divisibilityby four you might say well if you'redivisible if some number is divisible byfour then and I'll just write this arrowto mean if this then the number is goingto be divisible by two if it's divisibleby 4 then divisible by twowhat's the converse the converse isexactly the other way around soif divisible by 2 then divisible by 4now this is a particularly easy examplewhere we can see that in fact everysingle time that this is true this willalso be true so this whole statement istrue however every single time that anumber is divisible by 2 is it true thatthe number is divisible by 4 no becauseI can find many examples but all youneed is 1 a particular example issomething like n equal to 6 the number nis divisible by 2 but it's not divisibleby 4 so this is not a true statementhere's an example where we have oneif-then statement and we have itsconverse and it's converse is not trueso just keep in mind converses arepretty easy it's just the reverse
