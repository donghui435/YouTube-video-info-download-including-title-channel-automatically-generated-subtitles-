So in my last video I ranted about a taxi
driver who almost hit me in the crosswalkbecause they couldn¡¯t brake fast enough
in the rain, and I was thinking about thisproblem in a few ways.They couldn¡¯t stop before the crosswalk,
but really it¡¯s that they couldn¡¯t decreasetheir speed fast enough to get from 50 to
0 before hitting the crosswalk, or maybe it¡¯sreally that the slope of their decreasing
speed, out of all possible slopes, was nota steep enough slope.Too little deceleration.Now, some people after seeing my last video
protested my use of the term deceleration.Deceleration: is it even a thing?Or should we say¡­ negative accelleration?Because the opposite of speeding up isn¡¯t
slowing down, it¡¯s negative speeding-up.And that¡¯s the problem with cars; they have
separate modes for forward and reverse.When you¡¯re coming up to a stop light you
don't slow down by putting the car into reverse,you hit the brakes.And after you slow to a stop using the brakes,
if you want to start going backwards backout of the crosswalk, it's not like you do
it by just holding down the brakes real hard.Deceleration stops when the speed of the car
reaches zero, and negative accelleration startswhen you go into reverse, and when you brake
while in reverse, slowing down your slowingdown, that¡¯s negative deceleration.Which is also known as acceleration.Yep, hitting the brakes while in reverse actually
speeds you up, in the positive direction,because really we¡¯re talking about velocity
not speed.Velocity: it¡¯s speed that cares.About direction.Care-Speed.BUT IF WE HAD HOVERCARS, there¡¯s no frictional
attachment to the relative zero position ofthe earth, no friction-based brakes that care
about things like whether you¡¯re stoppedor not.In a hover car, you¡¯d be zooming up to the
crosswalk and instead of decellerating byhitting the brakes, because there are no brakes,
you'd hit the reverse thrusters that accellerateyou backwards, which would slow you down,
I mean negatively care-speed you up to speedzero but instead of stopping, the hovercar
would keep on the reverse thrusters and smoothlycontinue the deceleration curve until it were
back out of the crosswalk.And possibly very far away so that I don¡¯t
come after it on my hoverboard.Like, here's the regular taxi: vroooom eeeeeee-shnk.
mrhhhhshnk.And the hovercar: vvvvvv pffwhshhh.Clearly superior, and a much smoother ride.Good drivers avoid these sorts of nondifferentiable
changes in accelleration... y'know, the sudden-changeanglybits.Although in real life there¡¯s lots of little
slope-iness going on everywhere in here...Mm, slopes.I always found that weird, that you'd get
a smoother ride if you kept decelleratingin a hovercar until you're going backwards,
than if you just stop.Which is why to understand what it's like
to drive a hovercar I find it helpful to lookat the 2nd derivative, oh, did I mention care-speed
is the 1st derivative of position over timeand accelleration is the 2nd?Calculus.The art of lookin¡¯ at slopes.Side note: I'm pretty sure the reason Newton
gets the credit for inventing calculus insteadof Leibniz was that someone was like hey,
newton, what are you doin', and he was like,I am integrating the derivatives of the differential
calculus, and it sounded so fancy that theydecided kids just had to memorize all of it,
while when someone asked Leibniz what he wasdoing, he was probably like, I'm lookin' at
slopes, I like slopes.Do you like slopes?I like slopes.Anyway that's how it goes in my head.But it¡¯s the second derivative I care about,
because when you¡¯re driving that¡¯s whatyou have control over.You can accelerate and decelerate using gas
and brakes, that¡¯s it.Unless you¡¯ve got fancy cruise control that
lets you directly input a speed, in whichcase you can sometimes work on a 1st-derivative
level.And someday we¡¯ll all use self-driving cars
where you just put in the position you wantto go and they calculate the rest, ah technology,
lowering derivatives for the common good.Although if we were going to work directly
with position rather than acceleration I¡¯dprefer straight up teleportation but if you
like differentiable modes of transportationthen hovercars are the mathematically more
beautiful choice of vehicle with which tonarrowly avoid hitting pedestrians, just look
at that smooth flat deceleration that createsa constant sloping down-wards speed that goes
right through the stillness of 0 to continuebackwards, which means your position over
time as you approach the crosswalk and backaway again is the perfect smooth curve of
a parabola.And whenever you buy a hovercar you should
always check the range of your second derivativebecause more powerful thrusters means steeper
slopes for your first derivative and tighterparabolas.Parabola!It's got all the slopes!Look at the slopes!It's calculus! (lookin' at slopes).
