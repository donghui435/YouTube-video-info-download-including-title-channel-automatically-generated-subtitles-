OK, I know some people aren't
into green bean casseroles,but I like them.Plus, they remind
me of vector fields.Each green bean is
like a little arrow,and I just have the
urge to line themall up so they flow
in the same direction.Maybe a little wavy,
representing the vectorsof flow in a river or something.Maybe complete little eddies.Or maybe the beans could
represent wind vectors.Long beans would be
high-magnitude vectors sayingthere's a strong wind
in that direction,and short, low-magnitude beans
would mean low wind speed.You could have a hurricane
in your casserole dishwith the long beans of high wind
speed flowing counterclockwisenear the center, mellowing
out towards the outer edgesof the storm.The center would have the
shortest beans of all,showing the calm
eye of the storm.Oh, and if you're wondering why
I'm not curving the beans likethis is because while vector
fields might have a shapeor flow to them, the
vectors themselves don't.They're usually shown as
straight lines, or numbers,or both.But that's not because
they are straight lines.Vectors just represent what's
happening at a single point.It's like this tiny point
and this bit of windcan only travel in one
direction at a time,so the bean points
in that direction.And that tiny bit of
wind has a certain speed,which is represented by
the length of the bean.But the bean itself
is just notation.Vectors themselves don't have
a shape, just a directionand a magnitude, which means
a bean with a directionand magnitude is just as
legitimate a vector as an arrowplotted on a graph, or
as a set of two numbers,or as one complex number,
or as an orange slicecut with a certain
angle and thickness,or as shouting a
compass directionat a precise decibel level.North.East.I'll admit I'm not a huge fan
of individual vectors sittingby themselves without
meaning or context.One string bean does not make
a casserole or matherole,as the case may be.But fields of
vectors are awesome.They do have curves
and patterns, context,and real-world meaning.There are vectorizable fields
permeating this casserole dishright now-- the gravitational
field, for instance.Gravitational
forces are affectingall of my string beans, pulling
them down towards the earth.And so you could
use the string beansto create a vector-field
casserole that actuallyrepresents the gravitational
field they are currently in.Of course, this means
just lining up the beansso all point down.And since they're all affected
by basically the same amountof gravity, they should
all be the same length.If you are cooking
at a high altitude,be sure to cut your
string beans shorterby an negligible amount.Another favorite
vectorizable field of mineis also currently permeating
these string beans--the electromagnetic field.And if I had a giant bar magnet
as a coaster-trivet thing,maybe I'd want my casserole to
show the magnetic field thatis actually there.The points near the
poles of the magnetwould have larger vectors,
and they'd curve aroundjust like iron filings
do when you put themin a magnetic field.And the beans would show
how the force weakensas it gets further
from the magnetand goes from north to south.Or if you want to be true to
life and don't have a magnet,you could put
equal-sized string beansall pointing the
same way, and thenmake sure your casserole is
always pointing north, whichmight make it difficult
to pass around the table,but I think dish-passing
simplicity can be sacrificedfor the sake of science, or
mathematics, whatever this is.Speaking of which, you can also
invent your own vector fieldby making up a rule for what the
vector will be at each point.Like if you just
said for any pointyou choose, you'll take
the coordinates x comma y,and give that point a
vector that's y comma x, sothat this point, 0, 5,
has the vector 5, 0.And at negative 3, negative
1, you have negative 1,negative 3.And negative 4, 4
gets 4 and negative 4.It's so simple.But you get this
awesome vector fieldwhere the vectors kind of whoosh
in from the corners and crashand whoosh out.Anyway, there's lots of
other stuff you can do,but I'm going to go ahead and
pour some goopy stuff into hereand get this thing
casserole-ing.It may not look very inspiring
yet, but it's far from done.The most essential
part of a matheroleis an awesome oniony topping,
and I've got just the trick.I will even show it to
you in the next video.
