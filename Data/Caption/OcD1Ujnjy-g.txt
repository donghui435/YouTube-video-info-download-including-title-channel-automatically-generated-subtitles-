it's important to know the properties ofa rhombus why because you're going touse it in proofs true and falsequestions matching lots of thingsespecially when you're trying to findmissing angles and sides within aramisso let's get started the first key thingabout a rhombus is that it's aparallelogram so everything that appliesto a parallelogram also applies to arhombus so we have two pairs of parallelsides we also have four sides that areall congruent to each other not twopairs of congruent sides like arectanglethe second key thing is that thediagonals bisect the angles so if I drewin a diagonal here it will bisect thisangle into two congruent angles and itwill do the same thing to that angle sothese four angles will all be congruentto each other if I join the otherdiagonal it will bisect that angle andwill bisect this angle as well anotherkey thing is that the diagonals areperpendicular bisectors of each other sothey will always intersect at a 90degree angle and they're going to bisecteach otherso the diagonals of a parallelogrambisect each other but they don'tnecessarily intersect at a right angleor rhombus it has to intersect at a 90degree angle so just to remind yourselfthat these two things are not true forrectangles so for a rectangle thediagonals do not bisector angles and thediagonals and the rectangle are notperpendicular bisectors of each other
