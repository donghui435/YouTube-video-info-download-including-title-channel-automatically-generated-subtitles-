good morning friends topic for today'sclasses time speed and distance thistopic includes 10 feet distancedownstream of sceneLSP relative speed circular race numberof whites and it won't with Ebola thingsone by one with some examples so thatyou can easily understand this conceptnow I will start with this topic thebasic form like this topic is we allknow that distance traveled you can saythat this epsilon is equal to speed intothat that's one basic formula thedistance traveled is all equal to speedinto line when we consider the distanceDelta lies are measured in kilometersmeters well considers our kite this ismeasured in two hours or seconds when itcome on this field generally I haveincluded Okinawaover which is given as meter per secondwhen we may have a sweet I have given inelemental Baja or whatever saving itnow the first by here is how to convertyour sweet from Clarita power to meterper second suppose speed of the cursoris given 72 kilometers per hour and youhave another word into meter per secondwidow had this 72 clementa power means72 kilometerupon one hour now I wonder the world isit will only grow per second it meanskilo rental has to be converted intometers and all it has toin two settings I can say 100 meter haspower meters and one hour has 3600 sensemeans for The Heretic my speed into thelow rate will power the meter per secondfirst thing is I have to convert myElemental 2 meter and hours into secondstry let's say 72 in 2000 about 3,600 nowthis will be denser not to file to ateen pregnancy is 72 into 500 dailywhich is equal to 22 meter per second sowhat we infer this is the standardsection 504 any means when speed isgiven to kill a little buffer and youhave converted into meter per secondmultiplied your speed cyber Paula Deenand your speed astern over need to beDrupal set it all the hand when speed isgiven into meter per second you have toconvert it into a little buffer multiplythis by a deal by 5 and your speed isconverted into kilometer per hour sothis is your first step that you have tocram when speed is given equal topassword you can multiply it by 5 Iagree this will automatically beconverted into builder per secondsimilarly when speed is given into meterper second you have to multiply this ismy file and this will be converted intocolor it opal so boy I see speed of aperson is given as 20 meter per secondspeed of a person is given as 20 meterper second and we arelittle power we know it very well 20into 18 up on file final calls for ourspeed would be makin a 72 km/h thingthat we understood here that is how toconvert a speed power to middle persecond and slow meter per second todevelop power knocks release we havethis formula distance equal to speedeach time we try to understand therelationship between distance freedomthat distance is directly proportionallives heat distance is directlyproportional with speed when time isconstant similarly distance is directlyproportional to time their spirit objectthis speed is constant and speed andtime they are inversely proportional sowe can see the relation between spiritis inversely proportional what do youmean by this in the same time if yourspeed is more it means that is justeverybody will be move if the distancetraveled by you is samedo you then say when speed is more yourtime it will beright so we can say speed and time theyacceptable universally proportional nowthere is a need to understand thisconsented to the first informant thatsimply means the things which aredirectly proportional their racial ahsee suppose we know that distance andspeed are directly proportional right ifI say ratio of speaks of three personsABC is one measure to listening thereare three persons ABC and the race oftheir speed is one little two littlethree we have to find out what is theratio of the distance then we aredefined in the same time we know thatspeed and distance both directlyproportional when they show the speed isone racial to Allah show three three cansay the ratio that his death will alsobe one measure to ratio three your ratiowill be the same although if thequestion is achieve a ratio booth speedof three persons ABC is one little twolittle three we have to find what is theratio of their time theta there arethree persons ABC and the ratio of thespeed is what they should do recently wehave to find out in order to travel asaywhat will be the ratio of their timetaken now you look at speed and timethey are inversely were Muslim thatmeans let the race of the speed is givenand we have to find the race of theirtimeyou have to make it reverse it becomesas 1 upon 1 is to 1 upon 2 is to 1 upon3 else every 6 so we can say 6 littlefree nation - then we don't see us sowhen we have the same ratio their timetheta so we can say the ratio their timetaken is 6 special 3 they so - right wecannot make it as 3 ratio to ratio onethat will be wrong that can only happenwhen there are only two personssupposing I say only two persons arethere a and B and the ratio of theirspeed is given that is it - recently wehave to find this of their time takenwith a negative 3 the slope means whenthis of the speed is given to ratio 3and we have to find the ratio of thetime taken with either 3 - OH - howeverit because I can say speed is inverselywith time it becomes 1 by 2 ratio 1 by 3that automatically will be 3 - no Ithink the point is clear this concept isused is following some sort of questionsmain statement their speed ratio isgiven and we will find the rest of thetime we could easily found his ratiosspeed is given in the same time we havea foundation of the distance that willgive menow we use these concepts in so littleof substandard sources are there startwith my manga first IVs while going formy fist of the speed a man reaches 25minutes latequestion is why go ahead for my six ofthe speed a man reaches 25 minutes latewe find out what is initial time takenby the man to travel a distance what isinitial time taken by the man to travelthe distance means if its field is notdecreased what should be the heightlater by the men in order to travel adistance now we have two approaches forus in this question the first we sawwith the help of an equation approachand said it I also tell you how to gowith the ratio approach suppose speed ona person is X or in those villages andand SP time taken is equal to T rightnow as per the given condition s into Tis equal to Y distance traveled now itis given that if you go that for basketsof the speed means speed of a person is4 - - now it will get a speedo for myfifth which is waited a four by fivedays and he is laid by 25 minutes itmeans he has hit enterthat's more they get this into time isnow at distance if we go that small byfive of the speed we can say the speedwould before my finest and he did he isnamed by 25 minutes the time taken bythe person will be T plus 25 now we havea solvent and find the velocity that swill be danced about I rented my file Pequal to 40 plus hundred or I can say Tis equal to hundredsuppose we know of course is a steelpipe thickness T as it is equal to thistester now if you go that slow fastestof the speed it means his going tofollow a fifth of the speed and he is 25minutes late time taken by the personwill be T plus 45 no it's a very simpleequation I have to solve it inside thevalue of T right this is our SASapproach the same question can be solvedwith the help of the ratio notes how didit go for it it is given that y goingthat for wisest of the speed suppose oris then we will try to find the range oftheir speed to refer to D or is thespeed to loosely let or in the speed isone useful business for my son the ratiois 5 reason for that is or inversefilter new speedI know that the ratio of the time takenis reverse that because for racialfightsfo but I will take it why I am goingthat for my fifth of the split it meansif I say initial speed is 1 afterchanging the speed it becomes 4 by 5 Ican say the ratio of the speed will be 5is 2 so now after this if speed ratios 5ratio for thenow I can see and now in the speed hehas become Forex tank and a new spirit afighter stance and as per the facilityis given at least 25 minutes lateit means how much he plays now is thedifference X is equal to 25 we have tofind that t-shirt and make at least anhour ago Street for X that is 425 youranswer is equal to hundred than nofrills and this approach is taken as theratio approach we have taken that theperson goes and for my fifth of thespeed is Alicia spirit is one he goesfor breakfast it means the religion ofthe speed will be fire official food andwe can say the race of the time would itbe for the show side it means that isfor as this will be 5 X the differencein X that is equal to 25 financing theoriginal speed time taken by the personis 4 into 2500 second question on theSilver Line is speed of a personincreases by 20% here it is 15 minuteshoney what is the initial time taken bythe roster to travel a distanceit is with other person increases by 20%here it is 15 minutes ugly we have tofind out what is the initial time takenby the person to travel the distance ifI drove it the official passwordwhatever you do let her loose quit astime is equal to t SI - t is now adistance he increases the speed by 20%it means his speed would be a c2 in 2100well increase your speed by 20% you cansay the least it would be a sin to 120100 and he which is 15 minutes of theevenings time taken by nu is 15 minutesless t minus 15 I have a youth team whocan this hallway test will becomes about26 25 I can say v of T is equal to 60 -90 and T is equal to 90 so we can say heshould I have taken by the person isequal to 90 minutes same question may beanswered with this original approachalso how we can go for this speed of aperson ingredient by 20%it means if initially at 1 not without 6my effects because I have to increase by20% so we can see the ratio of the speedis financial things now it exhibits ofthe time taken that will be sufficientwhen he even sounded it means here taken50 minute less the difference in the onethe one is equal to 15 we have to findthe initial one that is original 6 6 isequal to 19 so Anthony the same that isequal to the speed of the person is onehis speed increases by 20% I can savethis is 1 now it has becomethey show their speed is biracial six wecan say the hints of their final basicspecified in this case here it is 15minutes early so I can see thedifference is equal to one when we saybodies 15 we have to find the initialone six will be equal to 19 our answeris said to be third is important sacredall this is a man goes at the speed of22 a little pond over here it is 15minutes late but if he goes at the speedof 50 included Obama here it is or I cansay we goes at the speed of 25millimeter per hour here it is 10minutes honey right what we have to findout we have to find out the distancethat man is running what should be theoptimal time taken by the man in orderto reach it thank and watch speed heshould maintain sole activity denied methree motions we have to sign down thefirst one is is manhole at a speed of 20he reaches 15 minutes late if you gothere this bit of 25 here is his 10minutes are we we are defined that isoptimal timing and speed that hereturned in timenow this consider you have twoapproaches the first approach is asimple equation approach here the speedis already considered speed of theperson is 20 and time taken by theperson his penis in this is he is laidby 15 minutes it means he has signaled15 minutes more and he was 15 I alludedinto the minutes and my speed is divided2 kilometer per hour so I can say 20into t + 15 upon 60 in the second casebut he is appalled at the speed of 25 hereaches 10 meters ugly that means 25 tminus 10 of 160 the course in that casehe would wait 10 minutes ugly we willstab little by Hitler to be 10 minutesless now I will finally here this wouldbe concerned out final 4 5 5 4 t + 60taken order to fire t-minus 50 T will beequal to 110 I can say thou evil timewill be taken by the person would be 110minutesthere is answer to this question becauseT is optimal time when he would be therein time so here I would say e will beequal to 110 minutes now I have alsosigned up at the stencil so this is notdistance and this is also the distancehere both in question at any place I canput t equal to 110 if you have to findthat distance I can say that distance isequal to 20 into 110 plus 15 upon 60 20with poetry and I can say that distanceis 120 gram of 3 kilometerthe distance potentially way I will findout a distance traveled from thisequation I have found the time right Iwill equal to 110 right now to put this100 and said this will solve it and wecan say that this sense is equal to 125upon 3 now we are going to find thespeed so we can see the distancetraveled is 125 over 3 upon their bigWi-Fi time is 110 minutes speed as weget closer to power we can work in twohours110 160 this would be taken as 125 by 3into 60 upon 100 and this will beanswered out 3 will go over 2 we can say250 upon 11 kilometres per hour that isthe required speed of the person hemaintains so that we get is in the threetype of forces will be asked about thishe will asking that distance first wefind the time then we will go over thedistance and if you ever find this fieldwe can find in such heavy now there aresome standards for Brazilif you have to only find that time thequestion is we are only find the timethat may also be found in such a wayinitially speed was plenty now willbecome 25 so we can see the ratio oftheir speed is for this effectinitially the speed was 20now speed is 35 2 we can say which ofthe speed is for a show file here inseries of their time is 5your spirits for the survival against avision of the time is my pleasure now inthe fuss yes here it is fulfill his lipsin the Senate is delicious ten winnershumbly we'll try and find thatdifference in their pendant with thefastest thumbs here it is 15 minuteslate in the second Astarte which is 10minutes public here I can say thedifference between their timing will be25 minutes because first of all is nowyour right now we can say the differenceis that in third time is 25 minutes herethe difference is the one the one isequal to 25 25 would be equal to 125means when the speed of the person was20 he has taken 125 minutes in that casehe was 50 minutes lateit means his time they come should be110 minutes that is when my tonsilsdidn't answer they ought to have them itis given that speed on the person was 20and after that it changes to 25 here Ican say the ratio of the speed is forthis of mine and I know that time isinversely proportion with speed so wecan say the ratio of their times will bev initial foo now it is given that inthe first instance he was 15 minuteslate in the second stanza verse 10minutes early the difference betweenthese two is 25 here that is when Z isequal to 1 so I can say 1 is equal to 25we have to find this file bygones if Iwill be taken as 125 but this file is sthe speed 20 and we know that when thespeed was 20 he reaches 15 minutes lateit means when he had taken 125 minutesthat is just eat more than the initialone twice for acts 15 my time would be110 minutes I think it's here similarlyif we have to only find the distance inthis question if you have to only findthat distance so women have moreapproached by they believe inelectrifying that distance so all of thedistance travel is equal to X so bothtotal distance that has to be traveledthis is equal to X right in the firstplace that is below 20it means he is taken time would be as my20 in the city is he is going at a speedof 25 which will be X about 25 in thefirst case speed of the person is 23 andsay time taken by the person in X about20 in the city gates speedometer is 25 Ihave taken would be X about 25 now wecan say that when speed is yes timetaken will be more we try to find thebeing that I am here he was have peopleat slicked hair nice 10x30 same as youconsider miss conditioners in that ideawould be 25 minutes I can say justsupply and this equals to 25 minuteswe divided by 60 why we have done thisbecause speed is given in two kilometerper hour and 35 in the minutes so weconverted into the hours now hold itelse there would be hundred five eighthsminus four X equal to 2500 160 X of 100equal to 25 of 160 X is equal to 25 intwo hundred upon sixty five one fivefive four three four twenty five we cansay that this sense is equal to 125 uponthree kilometer that binoculars the samedistance we have found when we haveformed this option we have a method thismay be very helpful when we are the onlyfind the distance you don't need tothink then no need to think anything butyou can but what you are just simplytake the distance in X a fast-food is 20X when I 22nd a speed is 25 X by 25enough Huskies omnibus 50 minute sendingis ugly white danglars it means thedifference is their time it is 25 so Ididn't say X about 20 minus X of35 is equal to 2560 just solve it andthere 125 of more 3 kilometersturbulenceI hope the concept is clear to digitalreproduction for the big time speed anddistance in which we have learned justhow to use the concept of time speed areformalized the sense is equal to speedinto time we just learned how to usethis concept here I would like todiscuss one very standard questionwithout stop it is it train travels 50kilometer in a no-risk of it is hetravels 40 kilometer in one we have tofind out what is stoppage time in theminutes per means how much minute wewill taste of it in an account this whatI can say is no focus is taken in 1 hourhe Thomas 52 meters if stoppage is takenhe tells 40 meters that means he travels10 kilometer less means if dopants is nocobalt is taken be llamas 50 millimeterifs nobody's taken he has particular sowe can see that he tellsless if stop indistinct right means forhow many minutes it took stop itthat is the time taken by him to travelthis distance of ten per meter meanstime takenif you have a scientist office time forwhat we can say for finding out thestoppage time we have to find the timetaken by a person to travel this 10kilometer right his actual speed is 50we can say in order to travel this 10kilometer time enter by the person is 10about 50 hours or we can say 1 uponfinal we will convert into winners thatis 12 minutes we can see in one of herstoppage time of the person is equal to12 minutes so our answer is he takes histop edge off 12 minutes per hour then hecomes over
