[Music]we're going to learn how to change thevalue of pi' by changing the way wemeasure distance before we learn how tochange the value of pi' let's review thestandard value why you've been told yourwhole life that pi is 3.14 first we needsome high school geometrywell pi is defined to be the ratio ofthe circumference to the diameter of acircle so to determine pi we just needto measure a circle but what preciselyis a circle a circle by definition isall the points that are a fixed distanceaway from a central point this is whydistance matters since distance is inthe definition of a circle the way wemeasure distance affects the shape andcircumference of the circle and thecircumference of the circle affects piethe usual way to measure the distancebetween these two points is given bythis formula using variables the formulalooks like this this is the familiarEuclidean metric metric is just a fancyword for the way we measure distance nowwe can draw a unit circle centered atthe origin which by definition is allthe points that are distance one fromthe point zero zerofinally we define PI to be the ratio ofthe circumference to the diameter sincethe circumference is roughly six pointtwo eight and the diameter is two thatmakes PI roughly equal to 3.14 but thereare plenty of other ways to measuredistance ways you use in your everydaylife let's say we're in Manhattan andI'm trying to give you directions fromMOH math the museum of math to MoMA theMuseum of Modern Art I'd probably sayit's 18 blocks away one block east and17 blocks north mathematicians call thisthe taxicab metric because a taxicabtraveling through a city grid can onlymove up indown or left and right it can't movediagonally so the taxi would have todrive a distance of 18 blocks to getfrom mo math to MoMA in other words thedistance in the taxicab metric from momath to MoMA is 18 units not the squareroot of 290 units that a bird would flyusing the Euclidean metric here's thegeneral formula for the distance betweentwo points using the taxicab metric sonow let's try drawing a circle of radiusthree in this metric that's all thepoints that are distance three from theorigin for starters we have these twelvepoints because a taxi can reach thesepoints by driving three blocks withoutbacktracking they're all distance threefrom the origin but here's where I'mgoing to break from reality and ruin themetaphor of a taxi instead of focusingon a physical taxi let's just look atthe formula for the taxicab metric whatif I wanted to measure the distancebetween 0 0 and 1/2 comma 2 and 1/2 thisis like asking a taxi to drive half ablock east and then two and a halfblocks north well that's not possiblesince it would drive through buildingsbut our formula still works math isn'trestricted to reality the taxicab metricsays that the distance between those twopoints is 1/2 minus 0 plus 2 and 1/2minus 0 which is 3since the taxicab distance between theorigin and the point 1/2 comma 2 and 1/2is 3 we need to put that point on ourcircle of radius 3 in fact now that weknow we're allowed to drive throughbuildings and the only restriction isthat we drive left right and up down notdiagonally we need to add a bunch ofpoints like negative two point threecomma zero point seven one and a halfcomma negative one and 1/2 and negativeone point 4 comma one point six allthese points are taxicab distance threefrom the origin and belong on ourtaxicab circle ofthree if we keep filling in the pointswe eventually get a shape that lookslike a diamondthat's the taxicab circle now let'scompute pi the ratio of thecircumference to the diameter to figureout the circumference we need to figureout how long each of the four sides isin this diamond looking shape let'smeasure the length of this side itextends from the point three zero to thepoint zero three we need to measure thedistance between these points using thetaxicab metric to get from three zerotwo zero three we have to drive threeblocks west and three blocks north whichis six blocks total so the points aredistance six away from each other thatmeans the line has length six that'skind of weirdyour Euclidian intuition might tell youto use the Pythagorean theorem andcompute that the line has length squareroot of 18 but your intuition and thePythagorean theorem don't work intaxicab land the line has length sixin fact by similar reasoning all fourlines have length six which means thatthe circumference has a total length of24 now the diameter of our taxicabscircle is six that means that pi is 24divided by six which is four not 3.14we've looked at two different ways tomeasure distance the Euclidean andtaxicab metrics and the circles createdby those metrics but as we mentioned inthe beginning of this episode there area lot of different ways to measuredistance let's go back to the Euclideanmetric where the distance between twopoints is measured this way let'srewrite it this way the Euclidean metricis also called the l2 metric because ofall the twos in the formula what happensif we replace all the twos by threeswell we get the l3 metric what does thecircle look like under the l3 metricthis it's all the points X Y such that Xcubed plus y cubed all to the one-thirdis equal to one the circumference ofthis circle measured using the l3 metricis roughly six point five two whichmakes the value of pi under the l3metric roughly three point two sixthere's nothing really special about thenumber three we can actually replace itwith any number P that's greater than orequal to onemathematicians call these LP metrics andthey're used all the time so what docircles look like under these LP metricswhen P equals one you get the taxicabmetric we saw before so the circle lookslike a diamond as P gets a little biggercloser to two the circle begins to lookmore like the circle you know and lovewhen P equals two it's the Euclideanmetric and so we get a normal circlethen as P keeps getting bigger thecircle starts to look more like a squarein the limit as P goes toward infinityit turns into a square but here's theamazingly cool part about how thatchanges pi when P equals one the valueof pi is four then as P gets a littlebigger closer to two the value of pigets smaller when P equals two pi is thenormal 3.14 then as P keeps gettingbiggerthe value of pi goes back up toward fourso among the lp metrics 4 is the maximumvalue of the ratio of a circlescircumference to diameter and 3.14159and so on is the minimum that is pi isthe minimum value of pi there areactually metrics different from the LPones which gives smaller values of piit's a little complicated to write downthe details are in the description butthere's a metric whose circle looks likea hexagon and the value of pi it's threeexactly three in fact it's a theoremthat four metrics given by lineargnorm which is a technical term for thekind of metrics we've been looking atthe value of pi is always between 3 & 4inclusive so while pi is not always 3.14it's always kind of close what's yourfavorite metric let us know in thecomments and we'll see you next time oninfinite series hello this week I'mdoing comment responses from the jointmathematics meetings which is a hugemath conference and I have the awesomeprivilege of working for their pressteam which means that I'll spend theweekend interviewing awesomemathematicians but right now I'm goingto respond to your comments about ourvideo can you hear the shape of a drum alot of you wanted to know does thisquestion make sense in other dimensionsit does and in fact it makes sense inother contexts the famous topologistJohn Milner pointed out that there are216 dimensional tour I that sounds thesame a torus is just the fancy math wordfor a doughnut so he's really sayingthat there are 216 dimensional doughnutswhose eigenvalues of the laplacian arethe same so in that sense they sound thesame but they have a different shape huhI got a good chuckle out of people likeChris Morano who were really frustratedthat I used the triangle which is thelaplacian symbol instead of theupside-down triangle squared theupside-down triangle is sometimes calledthe nabla or del symbol these are thesame things mathematically identical butI really like that people are debatingabout which symbol to use because itreally shows that mathematics has anaesthetic to it that there's qualitiesthat besides the literal meaning of thesymbols that matter so keep arguingabout those things Calvin Jones askedwould you expect those two drums toactually sound the sameI don't know uh the real world isn'texactly my thing I work in the mathworld and I know that those two drumshave different shapes but produce thesame eigenvalues so in that sense theysound the same there's a more detailedsense in which something could sound thesame which is called homophonic and iincluded a link to that but that's sortof a technical thing I think he's reallyasking about the physical question cuzwaves interact with space as they comeout of the drums they interact with yourear as you hear it and I have no ideawhat the answer to those questions areand I would love it if one of youexperts in the real world could answerthose questionsalright that's it for this week see youguys next week[Music]
