a solar eclipse is an absolute delight
to behold and so i'm going to show youthe mathematics behind how we can
predict when they're going to happeni'm recording this before the 2015
eclipsebut don't worry the information I'm
giving you now remain valid for at leastthe next nine hundred and eighty-five
yearsas you may have noticed the moon is not
transparentthis means that blocks the light from
the Sun and it casts a shadow occasionthat shadow moves across the earth and
if you're standing with a shadow fall'syour witness a total solar eclipse from
our point of viewthe moon has moved in front of the Sun
and completely blocked its light for asolar eclipse to work thoughthe moon has to be big enough to block
out the Sun and believe me this diagramis not to scalein reality the moon is 400 times smaller
than the Sun but in a fantastic cosmiccoincidenceit's approximately three hundred and
eighty nine times close-up on averageand that's close enoughit means from our point of view the moon
is almost exactly the same size as theSun in the skythis means it will line up and it will
completely block the disc of the Sun ifthe moon with any smaller or any further
awayit wouldn't be big enough from my point
of view to cause total solar eclipsesbut of course it could be bigger and it
could be closer and would still geteclipses but fantastically because the
apparent size of the moon matchesexactly the apparent size of the sun's
photosphere the bright surface of thesun it blocked out the bulk of the light
from the Sun but it doesn't block theSun Thank atmosphere as you can see from
this photograph taken in a total solareclipse the Sun has a very faint
atmosphere with fantastic structure init this is normally swamped by all the
photons coming from the rest of the Sunonly because our eclipses line up so
welldo we ever get to see it we are
incredibly lucky that from our point ofview the size of the moon matches
exactly the size of the SunI mean the probability of that happening
is literally astronomicalit may look like the Sun the Moon move
around randomly in the sky but that'snot the caseeclipses occur based on the some
earth-moon system the earth orbitsaround the sum and the moon orbits
around the earth and its when those twoorbits come into alignment and bring the
moon between the Sun and the earth thatwe get a solar eclipsealthough i should point out of course
once again that diagram was in no way toscare in fact there's pretty much
nothing in this videothat's to scale to illustrate what
happens during a solar eclipse here ihave the earth and you're going to be
the Sun so your line of sight of therays of sunlight coming out of your face
or whichever part of your body you shootthe Sun shines out of and then it hits
the earth except of course when the moongets in the white as it orbits around
the earthit causes eclipses and the moon orbits
the earth every 29.5 3059 days and sothere you have itthis is why we get a solar eclipse every
29 days 12 hours 44 minutes and threesecondsunfortunately it's not that simple of
course physics isn't that simplethere's actually more than one type of
lunar month poor exactly the same orbitso for a startthe moon doesn't go around the earth in
a circle actually follows an ellipsewhich means at different pointsthe moon is different distances from the
plant and its closest point it's 3603396 kilometers away from the earth and
its greatest distance its 405,000 504now the month i mentioned before the
29.5 three daysthat's the time the moon takes to be
from the point where its closest to theSun back to being closest to the Sun
again a different month is 27.5 fivedays and that's the time the moon takes
from being at the closest point to theearth back to being at the closest point
to the earth and the difference there isalmost two days and the reason for that
two day discrepancy is because theelliptical shape orbitduring the movies 21.5 five-day lap
around the earth the earth hasn't stoodstillit's orbiting the Sun it will have gone
for about 30 degrees of its orbit whichmeans even though the moon is back at
the same point relative to the earthit's no longer the same point relative
to the Sun it has to go a little bitfurther to go between Sun and the earth
once more and that's where the experttwo days comes from but it's not always
the same amount of time because themoon's elliptical orbit tracks with the
earththe direction is pointing changes
relative to the Sun so different pointsin the year it takes more or less time
for the moon to once again go betweenthe Sun and the earth that time I gave
you before the 29.5 three daysthat's just an average but it's okay we
can factor this all in we can do thecalculations on the elliptical orbit of
the moon as the earth goes around theSun and we can calculate how often the
moon goes between the Sun and the earthunfortunately it's not that simple yepthere was a third type of lunar month so
you're the son here we have the earththe earth is orbiting around you in a
fixed planethe man however orbits around the earth
in a different planeits orbit is tilted at 5.1 degrees from
the earth orbit around the sun and thisis why we don't get an eclipse every
single monththe moon has to both be going between
the Earth and the Sun as well as eithergoing down through the Earth's all that
or coming back up again and that is ourthird type of lunar monththe amount of time between the moon
going down through the Earth's orbit- when we get back to the same . and
there is 27 . - 12 21 days the shortestmonth yet and this explains why eclipses
are so rare we only get just over to ayear in fact we average 238 solar
eclipses per century but now we've goteverything sorted we can calculate when
they are unfortunately it's not thatsimpleremember themand elliptical orbit around the Earth
but that doesn't stay stilleither it actually drift by 40 points 7
degrees every year so it rotates onceevery eight point eight five yearsyes the moon's orbit orbits and so the
two points where it crosses the earth orbut drift around the earth over the
course of eight point eight five yearsand only when the moon goes between the
Earth and the Sun while one of thesenodal points is also between the Earth
and the Sun will we get a solar eclipseunfortunately it's not that simpleany second now unfortunately it's not
that simplethere's so much more to take into
account the Earth's orbit of coursethat's not a circleit's no lips as well and a lip that also
moves it rotates once every 20 and ahalf thousand years and the u.s. gravity
is a nice and tidy all knowfor a start the earth is in a perfect
sphere it's an oblate spheroid on top ofthat it's covered in water and the title
drag messes with everything and thenthere's the gravity between the moon and
the Sun so far already take into accountthe gravity between the Sun and the year
and then separately between the Earthand the moon but of course it's a
gravitational pull between the moon andthe Sun in fact the mutual gravitational
attraction between the Sun and the moonis over twice that between the Earth and
the moonthe direction the moon is traveling
relative to the Sun makes a bigdifference on its speed and that is
constantly changing in fact every singlenumber i have given you in this video
every direction every speed every angleevery time they're all only
approximations their averages the wholesystem is constantly changing it is a
wonder we have eclipses at allwhat this means is we can't make any
meaningful proper long-term predictionsabout solar eclipses but for the
reasonably near future we can and NASAhave gone through all of the years
between negative 1999 and positive threethousand they have analyzed all 60 1841
lunar months that's from New Moon to NewMoon and they've checked all eleven
thousand eight hundred and ninety-eighteclipses and put all the data up on
their website but to the undrained Ijust watching it happeningwe're back to a random movement of the
Sun and the moon in the sky andoccasionally they happen to cross but
then out of all this chaosanother cosmic coincidence steps forward
to save the datejust like the moon's apparent size
happens to match the sun's apparent sizethere is one special combination of the
three different types of Lunaand that happens to line up perfectlyif you take 220 three new moon months so
from closest to the Sun the closest tothe Sun and you compare that to 239 of
the month between the closest point ofthe earth to the closest point of the
earth and then you compare those two 242of the months between when the moon goes
through the Earth's orbit back to winour next goes through the earth orbitall three of those are pretty much
exactly the same length of time they allcome out spot on 18 years 11 days and
eight hoursand so it means if out of all this
random movement you somehow have a solareclipseyou know that 18 years 11 days and eight
hours later we will have had an integernumber of all the different types of
months in bold and so we will return topretty much exactly the same geometrythere will be another very similar
eclipse 18 years 11 days and eight hourslaterit's called the sarah cycle and allows
us to predict when eclipses are going tohappen in the reasonably near futureexcept of course unfortunately it's not
that simplethanks you're welcomein 2009 july twenty second i was lucky
enough to witness the total solareclipse when the moon shadow came across
the Pacific Ocean through Japan acrossmainland China and then out through
India because of the Saros cycleI know I can enjoy the next equivalent
to clips in 18 years 11 days and eighthours time and it will look like this in
the year 2000 27 on august secondexcept those eight hours are about a
third of the day and so the Earth'srotation won't line up everything else
willbut the earth will have spun about
another third of a rotation so theeclipse will actually happen over here
and then another Sarah cycle later in2045 on august 12it will be another third of a rotation
across and it will go through Americaand this cycle can also be worked
backwards before the 2009 eclipse is onein 1991 then 1973 1955 1937 1919 and
1901 you notice that over time theeclipses are actually working their way
up the planet and that is because of theslight mismatch of the Saros cycle with
the rotation of the moon's an ellipticalorbit around the Earth and it means that
the eclipses gradually drift further andfurther norththis particular Sarah cycle Sarah cycle
136 actually began on the fourteenth ofjune in the year 1360 on that day there
was an eclipse right down near the SouthPole is now gradually been working its
way up across the planet and the verylast one will occur on the thirtieth of
july in the year two thousand sixhundred and twenty-two right up at the
North Polethere are currently 41 active Sarah
cycles working their way up or down theplanetso there you have it the maths and solar
eclipses is an absolute mess becauseorbits are really complexcated however we do know solar eclipses
are amazing to watch if you can go andsee one do of course be safe and don't
blind yourselfand bear in mind that they're not gonna
be around forever partly because themoon is gradually moving further away
because of that title drag actuallydrifts about 3.7 centimeters throw away
from the earth every year which means itabout point six billion years it will be
too far away to cast a shadow on ourplanet but apart from that we have no
idea what the orbits will be like thatfar in the future according to our best
simulations in the next five billionyearsthere's a one-percent chance that
mercury will leave its orbit and eithercrash into Venus or the Sun in fact
there was a nonzero chance that in threepoint three six billion years the
gravitational force from Jupiter werenot mercury out of its orbit in turn
will impact on Mars that within slaminto the earthso you know enjoy eclipses while you canfor more math behind solar eclipses and
all sorts of diagrams and calculationsand plots and things that I can possibly
fit in this video's google checkoutNASA's five millennium canon of solar
eclipses i'll put a link to it in thecomments below is based on the fantastic
work of thread s been ax and geniuswhere you just want to see more videos
of me talking about mathsome of them a lot shorter and there's
much more mathematically certain thenjust click on the movethat's now orbiting meyeah
