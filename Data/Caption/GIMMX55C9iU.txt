all right in this video I just want todo a few basic questions related tofinding the quadrant in which an anglewill fall in the quadrant in which theangle will lieso suppose here's our little x-axis andour little y-axis there's onlyabsolutely a few things you have toremember one is the way in which welabel our quadrants again the top rightquadrant where X is positive and Y isalso positive that's quadrant 1 thiswill be quadrant 2 kind of the top leftcorner quadrant 3 is going to be ourbottom left corner and then quadrant 4is going to be our bottom right quadrantso I don't know every time I've alwaysseen these written people always useRoman numerals I don't know why soquadrant 1 2 3 and 4 makes you looksmart if you use a Roman numerals ok theother thing you need to remember welltwo things one right if we go all theway around if you go all the way aroundright we've gone a distance we'verotated 360 degrees and the conventionis again we measure angles from thepositive x axis if the angle is positivewe go counterclockwise if the angle isnegative we go clockwise ok so if you goall the way around we've gone 360degrees well if you've gone half wayaround that's going to be a hundred andeighty degrees well if we do half ofthat we're going to be at ninety degreesso and again right a little right anglemakes ninety degrees so if this is 90degrees this is 180 degrees if we addanother 90 we're going to get 270degrees and then we're back where westarted that would either be zerodegrees or 360 degrees so so again ifyou kind of don't move at all we saythat's zero degrees notice if you go allthe way around though we'rebe at the angle 360 degrees so this issomething else that's important you knowthere are many different angles thatwill put you kind of in the exact sameplace okay so let's just do a couple acouple basic ones here so which of thefollowing angles lies in the thirdquadrant we've got 45 degrees 195 andnegative 20 degrees so again this iszero degrees or equivalently 360 degreesif we go all the way around this is 90degrees at the top 180 over at the left270 at the bottom again this is if we'reusing positive angles and so the firstangle 45 degrees well certainly 45degrees is in between 0 degrees and 90degrees so 45 degrees the angle wouldjust be you know somewhere in the firstquadrant so that's not quite right we'llsee 195 degrees well 195 degrees ifwe've gone half way around we know we'reat a hundred and eighty degrees but thenwe would have to go another fifteendegrees so if we're at 180 and we gojust a few more degrees somewhere downhere this would make the angle 195degrees and certainly that's going toput us in the third quadrant again thisis quadrant one two and three so itcertainly it looks like 195 sore answerand let's just look at negative twentydegrees we might as well discuss thatone as well again since it's a negativeangle instead of going counterclockwisewe now go clockwise so negative twentydegrees would just put you kind of downa little bit in the fourth quadrantso this would be the angle negative 20degrees but again that's certainly inQuadrant four so that one's not correcteither so we said the first one is inQuadrant 1 195 is in Quadrant three andthen our last angle we said was inQuadrant four kind of switching againbetween Roman numerals and just regularnumbers so all right no big deal let'sjust do one more of these which are thefollowing angles lies and the secondquadrant negative 72 degrees 340 degreesor 120 so let's see let's talk about thenegative one first again we said this iszero degrees if you go counterclockwisethis is going to be positive 90 degreesbut if we go the opposite way that'sgoing to be equivalently we said it was270 degrees equivalently that's theangle negative 90 degrees again we'regoing clockwise well okay so zerodegrees here's negative 90 degreesnegative 72 degrees is going to besomewhere in between there so this wouldbe the angle negative 72 degrees againthis is in Quadrant four so that one'snot right 340 degrees well let's see wesaid if you go all the way all the wayaround you've turned 360 degrees well wedidn't quite go 360 degrees we went alittle bit less so it looks like to meour angle 340 degrees would also fallsomewherein the fourth quadrant so that would be340 degreesokay so again that one's not correctpositive 120 degrees we said if you'reat the top you're one way to describethat angle is positive 90 degrees if yougo halfway around hey that's 180 degreescertainly 120 Falls between 90 and 180so 120 degrees is going to be somewhereit's going to be somewhere in thatsecond quadrant so it looks like that'sgoing to be our answer choice in thiscase so this is very common stuff youknow finding the quadrant in whichangles lie you got to be able to do thisall the time so certainly one of thesethings that you you want to be able toget under your belt
