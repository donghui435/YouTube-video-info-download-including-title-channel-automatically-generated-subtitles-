You and nine other individuals 
have been capturedby super intelligent alien overlords.The aliens think humans look quite tasty,but their civilization forbids eating
highly logical and cooperative beings.Unfortunately, they're not sure 
whether you qualify,so they decide to give you all a test.Through its universal translator,the alien guarding you 
tells you the following:You will be placed in a single-file line
facing forward in size orderso that each of you can see 
everyone lined up ahead of you.You will not be able to look behind you
or step out of line.Each of you will have either a black
or a white hat on your headassigned randomly,and I won't tell you 
how many of each color there are.When I say to begin, each of you must
guess the color of your hatstarting with the person in the back
and moving up the line.And don't even try saying words
other than black or whiteor signaling some other way,
like intonation or volume;you'll all be eaten immediately.If at least nine of you guess correctly,
you'll all be spared.You have five minutes to discuss
and come up with a plan,and then I'll line you up,
assign your hats, and we'll begin.Can you think of a strategy guaranteed
to save everyone?Pause the video now 
to figure it out for yourself.Answer in: 3Answer in: 2Answer in: 1The key is that the person 
at the back of the linewho can see everyone else's hats
can use the words "black" or "white"to communicate some coded information.So what meaning can be 
assigned to those wordsthat will allow everyone else 
to deduce their hat colors?It can't be the total number
of black or white hats.There are more than two possible values,but what does have two possible values
is that number's parity,that is whether it's odd or even.So the solution is to agree
that whoever goes first will,for example, say "black" if he sees
an odd number of black hatsand "white" if he sees 
an even number of black hats.Let's see how it would play out
if the hats were distributed like this.The tallest captive sees three black
hats in front of him,so he says "black," telling everyone else
he sees an odd number of black hats.He gets his own hat color wrong,
but that's okaysince you're collectively allowed 
to have one wrong answer.Prisoner two also sees an odd
number of black hats,so she knows hers is white,
and answers correctly.Prisoner three sees 
an even number of black hats,so he knows that his must be 
one of the black hatsthe first two prisoners saw.Prisoner four hears that and knowsthat she should be looking for 
an even number of black hatssince one was behind her.But she only sees one, so she deduces
that her hat is also black.Prisoners five through nine are each
looking for an odd number of black hats,which they see, so they figure out
that their hats are white.Now it all comes down to you
at the front of the line.If the ninth prisoner saw 
an odd number of black hats,that can only mean one thing.You'll find that this strategy works
for any possible arrangement of the hats.The first prisoner has a 50% chance of
giving a wrong answer about his own hat,but the parity information he conveysallows everyone else 
to guess theirs with absolute certainty.Each begins by expecting to see an odd
or even number of hatsof the specified color.If what they count doesn't match,
that means their own hat is that color.And everytime this happens,the next person in line will switch
the parity they expect to see.So that's it, you're free to go.It looks like these aliens 
will have to go hungry,or find some less logical 
organisms to abduct.
