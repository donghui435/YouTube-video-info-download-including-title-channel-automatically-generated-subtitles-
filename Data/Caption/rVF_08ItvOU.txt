okay here's a little math slash chessproblem but you don't need to knowanything at all about chess to do thisso don't be turned off by that as alwaysfeel free to post a video response or topost your comments so I obviouslyencourage you to think about this beforeyou start reading comments or posting avideo response okay so here's thescenario so two people have a perfectlyconstructed chess board and they have anunlimited supply of pawns of exactly thesame dimensions so the first personplaces a pond anywhere on the board notnecessarily in the middle of a squarejust anywhere they want to the secondperson does the same thing they put apond anywhere that they want to on theboard and then you know it's the firstplayer's turn to go so again they put apond anywhere on the board that theywant to and play continues this wayalternating by putting pawns on theboard so the the idea is the firstperson that can't fit another pond onthe board is the loser okayso the first person that can't find aplace to put a pond on the board losesthe game so the question is with perfectplay who is the winner
