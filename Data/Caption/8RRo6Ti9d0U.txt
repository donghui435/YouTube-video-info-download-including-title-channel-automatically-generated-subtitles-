in this video I want to explain thedifference between factorial permutationand choose so if you take a look at yourcalculator just find the place where youcan see an N exclamation which is nfactorial and where you can see NCR andNPR in this video I'm going to show youwhen you should use these buttons now ifyou can't find these buttons on yourcalculator then you might want to throwit out and get a better one let's startwith n factorial for a really easyexample let's say that I have threethings like these three differentcolored markers and I want to arrangethem in a row so I could arrange themwith the blue one first and then purpleand red or I could keep the blue onefirst and swap these two like that or Icould put the red one first and then Ihave this option as well as this optionand finally I could put the purple onefirst and I have this option as well asthis option so there were several waysto do that let's count them out thenumber of ways to arrange three objectslet's think about the first position thesecond position and the third positionso when I hold my markers and I'mtalking about the first marker thesecond marker and the third marker Ihave three choices for what I want toput in the first position and as soon asI make that choice now I'm only going tohave two for the remaining let's say Ichoose red for the next position now Ionly have one left for this so it'spretty straightforward to see that thereare three choices for the first positiontimes the two choices for the secondposition times the one choice thatyou're remaining for the last positionand we write this as three factorial solet's just check it out let's see if itworks three and now I have to selectthis n factorial well I don't want topush the four so I have to use the shiftfunction and then push it and I getimmediately my answer six because I knowthat three factorial is 3 times 2 times1 which is 6now granted you can do three times twotimes one in your head but if you'rethinking about ten objects and you wantto arrange them in any in any possibleway and you want to know how many waysto do that that's 10 factorial so howwould you write that you would say thatthe number of ways to arrange 10 objectsis 10 factorial which is equal to 10times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 times 5times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 so youdon't really want to type all thosenumbers into your calculator and that'swhy we have the factorial button so youcan just type it in 10 now I'm going touse the shift and factorial so that'sthe answer for the number of ways toarrange 10 different objects in a rownow let's say you have 10 objects andyou don't care about arranging all 10 ofthem maybe you have 10 books and youwant to put only 4 of those books onto abookshelf or you might want to know howmany ways you could do that so let's sayyou have 10 books and you want to order4 of them only onto a bookshelf wellthen you really have the similar kind ofproblem where you're going to have 4positions that was of the 4 books thatyou're going to end up with but you have10 choices of books right now and so inthe first position you're going to have10 choices now that you've used up oneof the books you only have 9 books leftto choose for the next position and nowthat you've used up another book youonly have 8 choices and finally you have7 choices so this would be the number ofways to arrange four objects from acollection of 10 objects now you mightwonder why is it that I know that I'mmultiplying here let's think about aneasy example like what you're going tohave for breakfast let's say you havefour types of bread and you have twotypes of jam and you want to make toastwith Jam so first you're going to choosesome bread to use and then you're goingto choose some Jam to use so you havefour choices for your first task andyou're going to follow that by twochoices for your next task so basicallyyou could think about it asdecision tree where you're going todecide on one of the four options forbread and then once you've made one ofthose choices you have to now decidewhich type of Jam so the total number ofoutcomes is 8 so 4 times 2 so if youneed to perform two tasks or in generalmany tasks a series of tasks what youneed to do to figure out how many waysthere are to do it is to just multiplythe number of ways to do the first taskfollowed by the number of ways to do thesecond task let's take the example whereI'm arranging three pens we know thatthe answer is three factorial but let'sthink about it a little bit more once Ichoose one of the three things to gointo the first position my next task hasa different number of choices so what Ireally need to do is to look at giventhe information that I've alreadycompleted task number one that hasaffected my choice number two and that'swhy there's only two choices for thenext one and then only one choice forthe final one so it's a little bitdifferent from the toast it would be asif once you choose rye bread you're onlyallowed to choose strawberry jam andthen you don't have two choices anymorelet's take a look again at ten objectsand we want to order only four of thoseobjects we know that the number of waysto do that is ten times nine times eighttimes seven so that sounds a little bitlike factorial right because it lookskinda like that pattern but we stoppedat some point we stopped when we got toseven we didn't continue on six fivefour and three and two and one we didn'tdo that so if you wanted to just do thisdirectly on your calculator this is howyou would do it you would do ten permutefour because your calculator knowsexactly what that means and it says okayall you're trying to do is you have tenobjects and you would like to arrangeonly four of those objects and you'dlike to know how many ways there are todo that so if I have ten objects and Iwant to arrange only four of those and Icare about the order I need to use thisP button and P R so I have to use againthe shift to get this P and notice thatit'll tell me that that's what I'm usingnow I have to tell it what my R is my Ris fourthe answer is5040 as a double check let's make surethat we get five thousand and forty ifwe do it the way we know is correct andthat is ten times nine times eight timesseventhat's correct so if you type in tenpermute four into your calculator itwill give you this answer ten times ninetimes eight times seven but it willcourse give you the full product butlet's think about what it actually is sofar I've written 10 times 9 times 8times 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3times 2 times 1 so I've written 10factorial but we obviously know thatthat's not the answer the answer wasthis so I have to divide out by thepiece that doesn't make any sense herethis piece that's the piece that youdon't care about why do you not careabout that well you have these 10objects let's say you arrange all 10objects and you figure out the number ofways to arrange all 10 objects that's 10factorial but now you're only worriedabout the first 4 so the number of waysto arrange all that last part is notnecessary you don't need to worry aboutarranging those last six so you divideout by that when I divide out by 6factorial what have I done I've justcancelled all of this 6 times 5 times 4times 3 times 2 times 1 I'll use adifferent color all right so that makessense let's write this down completely10 factorial divided by 10 minus 4factorial that's exactly the same thingas 10 factorial divided by 6 factorialbut it's just a way to remember becausein general if you have n objects andyou're trying to permute only R of thoseobjects by the way permute means toselect with order then your answer willbe n factorial divided by n minus Rfactorial so now hopefully we understandwhat n factorial means and also what nPR or n permute are means what aboutthis guy over here and choose R how isthat different from NPlet's figure that out so I've writtenhere again the definition of n factorialwhich you should remember is the numberof ways to permute or order n objects ina row now NPR is doing the same thingexcept you only want to order R of thoseobjects so R has to be less than orequal to n so let's now think about whatwould happen if you have 10 objects orpeople or things or whatever let's say10 objects and now you want to selectfour of those but you don't care aboutthe order in which they are placed forexample maybe you're not putting bookson a shelf maybe you have people thatyou're selecting for a committee and itdoesn't matter if you pick Alice andthen Bob or Bob and then Alice becausethey're going to both end up on thecommittee so those sort of ways come outequivalent so what do you do if youdon't care about the order well all youdo is you can think let's say that I wasgoing to pick them where order mattersthat would be like using n PR or in thiscase 10 P 4 so here in our example we'relooking at the number of ways to selectwe're select means that order doesn'tmatter for objects from a collection of10 and we starting off by saying let'sdo 10 P for if we do 10 P for that'sgoing to give us the number of ways toselect four things or four objects butwe have some ordering on those objectsevery different ordering was counted sowe want to just divide out by how manyways there are to arrange those fourpeople what's that that's 4 factorial sowe get 10 factorial divided by 10 minus4 factorial this was just the definitionof 10 P 4 and then we have to divide by4 factorial because we've arranged andpicked our 4 people but all thosedifferent orderings were counted so whatwe have to do is divide out by thenumber ofto arrange those for people so that'sthe difference and PR means permuting orselecting with order and that's whatyou're going to get and PR and CR meansselecting without ordering and that'swhat you're going to get if you type itinto your calculator and see our ourlast example is if we have ten peopleand we only want to choose four of themso we don't care about the order inwhich we choose them we're going to doten then we again select the shift toget our choose function and then we putin the four and it equals 210 noticethat there are fewer ways to choose forpeople from 10 than there were topermute in fact if we took this numberof ways to choose the four people from10 and then we multiplied by the numberof ways to arrange those four people sowe would times that by 4 factorial weget back the number of ways to chooseand a range so you can choose andarrange or do it all at once with the Pso if you type into your calculator 10 C4 it's really doing 10 choose 4 it'scounting for you the number of ways toselect 4 objects from a group of 10 somaybe you have 10 people that have to goon a committee and you want to know howmany possible ways this committee can bebuilt and there's 4 members in thecommittee the answer is 10 C 4 see younext timewe could have two to the power of 32different possible 0 1 sequences
