Okay, here's a story that's not true.When I was a child I invented a machine.Not true.And all my machine was
was a row of boxes.And these boxes would go as far to the left
as ever I desired.Now, being a precocious child,
I gave this machine a very strange name.I called it a two-one machine
but in a funny backward way.But, I was a young child,
I knew no different.Okay, great.So what you do with this machine
is you put in dots.So I put in one dot.In fact, dots will always go in the right most box,
I get zoom¡ªWell, I get one dot, it's not very exciting.However, put in a second dot in the machine,
always the right most box, zoom¡ªThen something exciting happens
because whenever there are two dots in a box,they explode, kaboom,and are replaced by one dot,
one place to the left.Hence the name two-one machine.Get it?All right, so our two dots looks like this picturewhich I'm going to write as nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing, one dot, zero dots.So the code for two in a two-one machine
is now one, zero.All right, here comes a third dot.Always in the right most box?
Zoom.So what's the code for three?One, one.All right, four.I have a feeling putting in a fourth dot
is going to be particularly exciting.Here goes.Here it comes, right most box.
Zoom.Two dots in a box¡ªkapow!Dot.Ah! Again!
Kaboom!Dot.Wow.So what's the code for four?Nothing, nothing, nothing,
one dot, zero dot, zero dots.Bingo.Can you see what the code for five
is going to be?Zoom.
One, zero, one.How about six, can you see what the code
for six is going to be?Zoom.
Kapow!Dot.One, one, zero.Great.
Your turn.Thirteen.What's the code for the number thirteen
in a two-one machine?I've skipped some numbers,
watch out.Okay, there's something to think about.Play with it for a while.We'll definitely give the answer away
in a later video but try for yourself right now.Hours of fun to be had with a two-one machine.
