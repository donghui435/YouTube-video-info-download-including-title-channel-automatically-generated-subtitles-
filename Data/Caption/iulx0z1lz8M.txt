Use the quadratic formula to
solve the equation, 0 is equalto negative 7q squared
plus 2q plus 9.Now, the quadratic formula, it
applies to any quadraticequation of the form--
we could put the 0 onthe left hand side.0 is equal to ax squared
plus bx plus c.And we generally deal with x's,
in this problem we'redealing with q's.But the quadratic formula says,
look, if you have aquadratic equation of this form,
that the solutions ofthis equation are going to be
x is going to be equal tonegative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared minus4ac-- all of that over 2a.And this is actually two
solutions here, becausethere's one solution where you
take the positive square rootand there's another solution
where you takethe negative root.So it gives you both
roots of this.So if we look at the quadratic
equation that we need to solvehere, we can just
pattern match.We're dealing with q's, not
x's, but this is the samegeneral idea.It could be x's if you like.And if we look at it, negative
7 corresponds to a.That is our a.It's the coefficient on the
second degree term.2 corresponds to b.It is the coefficient on
the first degree term.And then 9 corresponds to c.It's the constant.So, let's just apply the
quadratic formula.The quadratic formula will tell
us that the solutions--the q's that satisfy this
equation-- q will be equal tonegative b.b is 2.Plus or minus the square root
of b squared, of 2 squared,minus 4 times a times negative
7 times c, which is 9.And all of that over 2a.All of that over 2 times
a, which is onceagain negative 7.And then we just have
to evaluate this.So this is going to be equal
to negative 2 plus or minusthe square root of-- let's see,
2 squared is 4-- and thenif we just take this part right
here, if we just takethe negative 4 times negative
7 times 9, this negative andthat negative is going
to cancel out.So it's just going to become
a positive number.And 4 times 7 times 9.4 times 9 is 36.36 times 7.Let's do it up here.36 times 7.7 times 6 is 42.7 times 3, or 3 times 7 is 21.Plus 4 is 25.252.So this becomes 4 plus 252.Remember, you have a
negative 7 and youhave a minus out front.Those cancel out, that's why
we have a positive 252 forthat part right there.And then our denominator,
2 times negative7 is negative 14.Now what does this equal?Well, we have this is equal to
negative 2 plus or minus thesquare root of-- what's
4 plus 252?It's just 256.All of that over negative 14.And what's 256?What's the square root of 256?It's 16.You can try it out
for yourself.This is 16 times 16.So the square root
of 256 is 16.So we can rewrite this whole
thing as being equal tonegative 2 plus 16
over negative 14.Or negative 2 minus-- right?This is plus 16 over
negative 14.Or minus 16 over negative 14.If you think of it as plus or
minus, that plus is that plusright there.And if you have that minus,
that minus isthat minus right there.Now we just have to evaluate
these two numbers.Negative 2 plus 16 is 14 divided
by negative 14 isnegative 1.So q could be equal
to negative 1.Or negative 2 minus 16 is
negative 18 divided bynegative 14 is equal
to 18 over 14.The negatives cancel out, which
is equal to 9 over 7.So q could be equal to negative
1, or it could beequal to 9 over 7.And you could try these out,
substitute these q's back intothis original equation, and
verify for yourself that theysatisfy it.We could even do it with
the first one.So if you take q is equal
to negative 1.Negative 7 times negative 1
squared-- negative 1 squaredis just 1-- so this would be
negative 7 times 1, right?That's negative 1 squared.Negative 1 times 2 is
minus 2 plus 9.So it's negative 7 minus 2,
which is negative 9, plus 9,does indeed equal 0.So this checks out.And I'll leave it up to you
to verify that 9 over7 also works out.
