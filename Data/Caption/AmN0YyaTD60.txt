Hexaflexagons-- they're
cool, hip, and hexa-funto play with, right?Wrong.Hexaflexagons are not toys.With the increasing number of
hexaflexagons finding their wayinto homes and schools,
it's important to be awareof proper flexagation
regulationswhen engaging in flexagon
construction and use.Taking proper precautions can
help avoid a flexa-catastrophe.Do not wear loose clothing
when engaging in flexagation.If you have long
hair, tie it back,so it doesn't get caught
in a flexagation device.Ties are also a common
source of incidents.Stay alert.Never flexagate while
under the influence.When using a hexaflexagon,
sudden unexpected sidesmay appear, and drugs like
alcohol can slow reaction time.If you aren't sure what kind of
flexagon you're dealing with,it's safer to temporarily
disable the flexagon.Flexagons can be disarmed
by using scissorsto cut them apart.You can cut across
the original seamwhere the paper strip
was taped together,which may appear on the
edge or through the faceof the flexagon.In an emergency,
however, flexagonscan be cut apart right through
a triangle, or on three edgesif you want to retain symmetry,
or into nine separate trianglesif you really want to be safe.You can even cut them in half
down the length of the paperstrip like this,
into two separate--Once you cut your
flexagon apart,you can figure out
what kind it is.If it has nine triangles,
that's 18 triangle sides.So at six triangles
per hexagon side,that's three sides
of trihexaflexagon.Note that some
flexagons might bemade from a double strip of
triangles that have been foldedin half, so that marker
doesn't bleed through.Don't let yourself be fooled
by the extra triangles.Avoid danger during
hexaflexagon construction.If you're not working
from a printed pattern,you might start your
flexagon by picking a pointon the edge of a strip of
paper, folding that 180 degreeangle into thirds to
create 360 degree angles,and then using the equilateral
triangle that resultsas a guide to fold the
rest of the strip of paper,zigzagging back and forth.Without proper
attention and focus,this could easily lead to
becoming unreasonably amusedwith the springy spring of
happy triangles that results.Always keep your hexaflexagon
in good working order.Pre-creasing all the
triangles both waysbefore configuring them into
hexaflexagonal formationwill help your flexagon operate
properly and avoid accidents.Keep a close watch on the
chirality of your hexaflexagon.That is, whether it is
right or left handed.Notice how in this
hexaflexagon, water flowsclockwise down under
the flaps, evenif you flip it over or flex it.Well, in this hexaflexagon,
it flows counter-clockwise.They're mirror images.The chirality is decided
when you fold and tapeyour triangles into a
twisty loop, and once taped,it is impossible
to change from oneto the other without
cutting it apart,at least in three-dimensional
euclidean space.A change in chirality
could be a signthat your flexagon
has been flippedthrough four-dimensional
space and is possibly a highlydangerous
multi-dimensional portal.With experience, a
hexaflexagon mastercan construct a hexaflexagon
in mere seconds.Some forgo tape and
scissors entirelyby folding a double
strip that's too longand tucking the extra in.This is an advanced
technique that should notbe attempted without
prior training.Beware topological changes.This family seems safe
from this philosoraptor,because they live
on separate planetswith a cold, empty vacuum
of space between them.But after a single flex,
the unfortunate victimsare now doomed, protected only
by the inconsequential barrierof their domicile.Your stars might explode,
your frowns may become smiles,your most pointy
of triangles mightbecome the roundest of circles.Perfectly healthy snakes
may turn into snake loops,or worse, become decapitated.Either state is
fatal for the snake,as having no head can
lead to starvation.This can be avoided by simply
marking where connections willbe across neighboring
triangles first.Afterwards, the lines can be
filled in however you like.Be aware that with
the trihexaflexagon,there are two
variations to each face.So you can simply draw one
side where triangles connect,and flip and draw the other.But in the hexa-hexaflexagon,
the main threefaces each appear
four different ways.If you use hexaflexagons,
keep an eyeout for signs of dependency.Overuse can lead to addiction
and possibly an overdose.Some users of hexaflexagons
report confusion,mind-blown syndrome,
hexaflexaperplexia,hexaflexadyslexia,
hexaflexaperfectionism,and
hexaflexa-Mexican-food-cravings.If you find yourself
experiencingany of these symptoms, stop
flexagon use immediately,and see the head of
your math department.With proper
precautions, flexagatingcan be a great
part of your life.Follow these simple
safety guidelines,and you should be ready for
a fun and safe hexaflexagonexperience.
