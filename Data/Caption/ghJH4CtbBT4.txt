welcome it's one of my favorite puzzlesof all time let's consider the powers of2 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 and so on my questionis simply do any of these powers of 2ever begin with a 7 you tried for awhile 128 256 512 1024 and it seems theynever begin with a 7 keep going keepgoing keep goingwhat we'd like to do now is brieflyexplain Benford's law now Bedford wasearth there's a fella in the 1930s whodiscovered in fact that Newcomb actuallybetter forty years older than him haddiscovered that in log tables andscientific data tables about 30 percentof the digits that seemed to begin witha 1 so look at the powers of two sortsof ones we see one for the bat and aboutsome percentage I feel things about 15%of just machines begin with the two andso on and about 5.8 percent of all datahas digits the begin with the seven thatincludes the powers of two in factthere's infinitely many powers of twothat do begin with a seven and in factI'll even say that's the five pointeight percent of them dothat's Benford's law what I should do inthis video is briefly explain the lawI'm not there to get to the detailsproperly start with in an essay that'salso on the website which you can readit all in full glorious detail there butlet's prove right now or listing leastleast let me get it going to believethat those gonna in fact be 5.8 percentof the powers or to begin with the 7 andif you're bored with this video what adoodle instead simply find the first onethat does its way up there alright heregoeslet me draw that benefits law so let'slook for a power 2 that begins with apoem that means I need a number 2 to theK whoops with my pen that's Arthurbetween 7 & 8 well that's not gonnahappen cause between 70 and 80 or tween700 and 800 and so on as we begin withit 7 has to be in some 7,000 to 8,00017,000 18,000 so forth that is I'mlooking some equation of the form somepower 2 that lies between 7 times 10 tothe N and 8 times 10 to the N now assumewere 3d with logarithms let's take thelog ins of everything here that meanslog of 7 plus n must be less than Ktimes log of 2 must be less than log of8 oops 8 plus andit is unlocking for multiples of log oftwo that lie between log of seven andlog of eight feet up to some integer nowpath up to integer part is a little bitannoying if I should draw some numberline here's the number one one two threefour I look for powers of two that liebetween log seven and log eight which issomething like here or an integer uphere or initiative up here or aninterested up here or energy up hereinstead of dealing with all these littleintervals of the same base at the sameshape let me take this number line andwrap it into a circle and have all theseregions lie on top of each other that isI'm going to consider the number linethere's now one great big circle likethis whoops if I actually draw it sothere's zero and there's also one andthere's also two three so this pointhere at Bizness all the integers here'slog of sevenhere's log of eight and what I'm goingto do is March the groups of log of twoaround the circle and see if they everland in this region here in fact whatI'd like to prove is the multiples ofblock of to Marsh around the circle andfill it up completely which case aglutamate solution say that's thefraction the powers of two that beginwith a seven and I forget at mycalculator I believe log of seven isabout zero point eight four five and logof eight is about 0.9 or three so thisis a represents a region about lengthzero point five eight that is the wholecircus so going to come for this oneabout point five eight of it correspondsto those that begin with a seven that isthat's where I've got the number fivepoint eight percent from log of agentminus log of seven is about five pointeight percent alright so in the same waythis is true when I bet to establish nowI get the number positive that beginwith a nine there'll be log of 9 minuslog of 8% but that is no if hasn't truethat begin with the three etc all rightour goal is now is to examine multiplesof log of two as they march around thecircle and we to prove that they'regoing to fill up this entire circlethat's two steps first of all I need thefact that log of 2 is an irrationalnumber that is- we'll never be a fraction a over B andthat's pretty easy to see if I translatewhat logarithms me that means to enterthe a of a B must be two raising bothsides to the beef power gives me a go tothe a is 2 to the B which is interestingcuz the left hand sides are mortal 5 andthe right hand side isn't so that'simpossiblewhich means writing log base 2 as afraction is also impossible all rightthat means it's a match around circlehis log base a to wherever it is his tolog base 2 his 3 log base a to his 4 logbase of 2 5 log best to his 6 log base 2so no two dots will ever land on top ofeach other why well if a two dots lineup sumption table chart means somemultiple of log of two basically equalsanother mod home log of 2 but rememberthis is wrapped around I could be off byan integer if I submitted to Canaan alittle bit of algebra means that this istelling me that log of 2 is the fractionK of n minus M that's not a fraction soit's not gonna happen so these multiplesof log of 2 will never land on top ofeach other on the circle the next stepis to prove that they actually fill upthe circle they don't actually justcontinually miss a gap they always missthis gap that I couldn't say that 5point 8 percent of the circleslegitimately filled up by thesemultiples a block of - well how do Iprove that they are fill up the entirecircle well what I'm gonna do now mypictures getting destroyed or messy thisis probably worse better to read myessay rather than to watch this videolet's divide the circle into say ahundred little evenly spaced pieces each1.01 wide and let's look at the first101 multiples of log of 2 log of 2 2 logof 2 well director 101log of 2 that means I'm trying to fit101 multiples into a hundred spacessomewhere there's got to be two modelsthat fit in the same space so that meansI've got one more to block of 2 plussome extra number of multiples a blockof 2 maybes and 91 of them or somethingwill get me within the same space 2.01wide well for diction 91 of them we canapply from here and get another 1.01wide less than point 1 why disappointingone wide so I could argue every 90 monthmodel of two if my number 91 is correctfills up the circle in spaces leftpoint one wide well point mums out toAmerica do 0.001 or 0.0001 and saymultiples a block or two I can flip thewhole circle of with no more than 0.0001and so on so this is this numbers quitearbitrary that means the powers are tolog of to the multiples of piggie pardonof log of two can never leave a gap ofany width otherwise just I could do itrepeat this argument says there'll betwo multiples that fall within that thatsize gap so there we have it very roughvery brief very quick but thesemultiples of log of two actually willnever land on top of each other and I'llnever have gaps that fill up any space Iwant to make you want to try to maketherefore they testily fill up thecircle and I can little legitimate saythat this fraction of them land betweenlog of seven and log of 8 that is thereare five point eight percent of thepower to begin with sevenwell this board is wonderfully messy soAmma's will just mess it up a bit morelet me assure bamaca space I don't getwhy the after my very first question cuzactually leads to yet another mystery ifyou check to the 46 begins of the Sun sodoes to 256 and to 266 and to the 76whoops and to the 86 and to the 96 andif I remember correctly to the 106doesn'tso my next mystery why these groups often if you keep going with the care comafor the next power of true that beginswith 70 a funny goes to string anotheranother string of the but separated bypowers of ten curious what's going onthereall right thanks very much
