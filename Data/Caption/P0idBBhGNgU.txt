who was Srinivasan Ramanujan the geniuswho leaves mathematicians speechlessborn in 1887 Ramanujan grew up in MadrasState now called Tamil Nadu in southernIndia he fell in love with mathematicsearly by age 11 he had exhausted themathematical knowledge of two collegestudents who were lodgers at his homewhen he was 16 he obtained the book asynopsis of elementary results in puremathematics by G s car though this bookwas essentially a study guide Ramanujanintensely studied this book with its5000 theorems and it is credited withawakening his genius Ramanujan spenthours producing his own new formulas ona slate with only the best findingstransferred to a notebook he was toopoor to afford much paper a simpleexample states that if a plus B plus Cequals zero then this formula relatingfourth powers is also true another earlyhead-turner is this equation involvinginfinitely many nested square rootsalthough Ramanujan had won a collegescholarshiphe had no taste for non mathematicalsubjects namely English Greek and Romanhistory and physiology and so he flunkedout of college twice while supportinghimself as a clerkRamanujan smash a mentor 'he'sencouraged him to show his work themathematicians in england the first twoprofessors to whom he wrote hf Baker andII W Hobson simply return Ramanujan Speypurrs without commentbut the third one the renowned Cambridgeprofessor gh Hardy had a positiveresponseRamanujan 'he's nine page letterincluded mesmerizing formulas such asthis infinite series involving thereciprocal of pi or this infinitecontinued fraction involving both PI andE when Hardy and his close collaboratorje little would read over the samplingof Ramanujan results they wereoverwhelmed and became convinced thatRamanujan was a genius Hardy would laterwrite these equations had to be truebecause if they weren't nobody couldhave imagined them Hardy invitedRamanujan to do research with him atCambridge and so in 1914 Ramanujansailed for England his formulas had Abbywitching effect on many researchers theHungarian mathematician george p¨®lyaborrowed one of the notebooks from hardybut returned it quickly because he wasafraid of getting sucked into Ramanujanswirled and stopping his own researchone research area that Hardy andRamanujan worked on was the theory ofpartitions let's start with an easyquestion how many ways can the number-7be written as a sum of natural numbersit's easy to list the possibilitiesordering the parts from largest smallestand find fifteen ways but how manypartitions are there of the number 50the number of possibilities explodes buta careful analysis shows that there areexactly two hundred and four thousandtwo hundred and twenty six ways in theirstudy of partitions Hardy and Ramanujanhad several breakthroughs todaypartitions are connected to many areasfrom as simple as the number of ways tomake change for a dollar using thesedifferent points can you count them allto bose-einstein condensation instatistical mechanics also connected topartitions Ramanujan discovered what arenow called the roger's Ramanujanidentities some fascinating propertiesof partitions follow from thesemysterious formulas here's an examplelet's restrict the partitions of 11 intwo different ways those where all theparts differ by at least two and thosewere each of the parts end with either 14 6 or 9 there are seven partitions ineach of these restricted classes theroger's Ramanujan identities imply thatthese totals match for the partitions ofany number n Ramanujan found lifechallenging in England with his longstanding health problems isolation andthe scarcity of vegetarian food in 1917he was confined to a sanatorium aninteresting story occurred during thisperiod Hardy visited Ramanujan in thehospital and said that he had ridden intaxi cab number 17 29 and remarked thatthe numbers seem to be rather dull noreplied Ramanujan it is a veryinteresting number it is the smallestnumber expressible as the sum of twocubes in two different waysindeedtwenty nine can be written as 1 cubedplus twelve cubed or nine cubed plus tencubedin fact Ramanujan found infinitely manyequations where the sum of two cubes isjust one away from another cubeRamanujan was the master of numbers uponhearing the taxicab story Littlewoodcommented that every positive integer isone of Ramanujan spur Sanel friends whenhe was eventually well enough to leavehe returned to India supposing that thewarmer climate and reconnection with hisfamily would bring him back to fullhealth upon his return Ramanujan wasoffered a professorship at theUniversity of Madras and was welcomed asa hero his strength however Abdo a andhe died at the young age of 32Ramanujan romantic story did not endwith his death decades later BruceBarron published many books aboutRamanujan findings in 1976 GeorgeAndrews visited Cambridge and found somenotes at Ramanujan had written hiddenaway in whren library these notes arenow referred to as the lost notebook andhave also been studied closely despitegrowing up in poverty and beingself-taught Ramanujan pitted his brainsagainst the accumulated wisdom of Europeand produced mysterious and powerfulformulas that still leave mathematiciansawestruck it is no wonder that Ramanujanhas been called the man who knewinfinityyou
