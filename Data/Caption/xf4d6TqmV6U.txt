Next we're going to talk about axis, and the
way we can show that is we have a horizontalaxis that we call X, and also we have a vertical
axis we call Y. And these are two axes, alright?Where they cross is called an origin, which
has the value zero, zero. Now we can thinkabout this axis as a number line with positive
values in the X axis, positive values to theright,
and negative values to the left of the origin.Similarly on the Y axis, we have something
that looks ninety degrees. We have one, two,three, four, five, and going the negative
direction below the origin, we have negativeone, negative two, negative three, negative
four, negative five. Now this can go on forever.And this plane, this rectangular coordinate
plane is sometimes referred as the CartesianCoordinate, and we can divide this plane into
four quadrants. The first quadrant has thevalues of X, all positive, and the values
of Y, all positive. The second quadrant hasnegative values of X and positive values of
Y. The third quadrant, we're going counter-clockwisehere, the third quadrant, X values are negative,
Y values are also negative. And then the lastquadrant, which is the fourth quadrant, X
values are positive, Y values are negative.So the Cartesian Coordinates are divided into
four quadrants: quadrant one, positive positive;quadrant two, negative positive; quadrant
three, negative negative; quadrant four, positivenegative.
