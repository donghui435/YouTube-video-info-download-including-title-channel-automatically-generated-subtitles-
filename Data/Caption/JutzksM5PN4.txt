- WELCOME TO AN INTRODUCTIONTO INVERSE TRIGNOMETRIC 
FUNCTIONS.THE GOALS OF THE VIDEO ARE TO 
USE INVERSE TRIG FUNCTIONSTO FIND AN ANGLE OF A GIVEN 
TRIGNOMETRIC FUNCTION VALUE,AND ALSO TO USE INVERSE 
TRIGOMETRIC FUNCTIONSTO SOLVE A RIGHT TRIANGLE.REMEMBER, YOU CAN THINK 
OF A FUNCTIONAND ITS INVERSE FUNCTIONAS TWO FUNCTIONS 
THAT UNDO EACH OTHER.HERE'S AN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS.LET'S SEE 
WE HAVE THIS FUNCTION F,AND X IS THE INPUT 
AND Y IS THE OUTPUT.WELL, THE OUTPUT OF F BECOMES 
THE INPUT OF F INVERSEAND F INVERSE OUTPUTS X.SO WHAT WE SEE HERE 
IS WHATEVER WE START WITHWE END UP WITH THE SAME THINGIF THESE TWO FUNCTIONS 
ARE INVERSES OF ONE ANOTHER.HERE'S A WAY TO LOOK AT IT 
FROM A TRIG STANDPOINT.IF I LET F OF X = SIN X, AND LET 
THE INVERSE BE INVERSE SIN.LET'S SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, 
I INPUT 30 DEGREES.WELL, THE SIN OF 30 DEGREES 
IS EQUAL TO 1/2.AND IF I PUT THE SIN RATIO 
INTO THE INVERSE FUNCTIONIT WILL RETURN THE ANGLE AGAIN.SO THE FINAL RESULT WILL BE 
30 DEGREES AGAIN.INVERSE TRIGOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 
ARE WRITTEN AS WE SEE HERE.Y = INVERSE SIN X.BUT WE CAN ALSO WRITE THIS 
AS ARC SIN X.AND INVERSE COSINE X 
CAN BE WRITTEN ARC COSINE X.AND INVERSE TANGENT X CAN BE 
WRITTEN AS ARC TANGENT X.THE THING TO REMEMBER IS THATFOR THESE INVERSE TRIGOMETRIC 
FUNCTIONS,THE INPUT IS A TRIG FUNCTION 
VALUEAND THE OUTPUT IS AN ANGLE.AND WE CAN USE 
INVERSE TRIG FUNCTIONSTO SOLVE THE FOLLOWING TYPES 
OF PROBLEMS.USE THE CALCULATOR 
TO FIND THE ANGLE, THETAON THE INTERVAL FROM 
ZERO TO 90 DEGREESTHAT SATISFIES THE EQUATION.SO WE KNOW THAT SIN THETA 
IS EQUAL TO 0.7523,AND OUR GOAL IS TO FIND 
THE ANGLETHAT WOULD GIVE THIS SIN VALUE.SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS TAKE THIS 
EQUATIONAND TAKE THE INVERSE SIN 
OF BOTH SIDES.NOW, REMEMBER 
THAT THESE TWO FUNCTIONSARE INVERSES OF ONE ANOTHER.SO THEY WILL UNDO EACH OTHER.AND THE RESULT OF THIS WOULD 
JUST BE THETA ON THE LEFT SIDE.AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE THIS --AND THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE 
RATIOSTHAT WE ARE USED TO SEEINGIN REGARDS TO ONE OF THE 30, 45, 
OR 60 REFERENCE ANGLES.SO WE WILL HAVE TO USE 
OUR GRAPHING CALCULATOR.SO LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND GET THAT OUT.AND NOW WE WILL USE 
THE INVERSE SIN KEY,WHICH IS HERE, 
RIGHT ABOVE THE SIN KEY.SO IF YOU PRESS SECOND SIN,IT BRINGS UP 
THE INVERSE SIN FUNCTION.THEN WE JUST TYPE IN 0.7523,AND THIS WILL RETURN THE ANGLE 
WITHOUT HAS THAT SIN VALUE.SO IT'S ROUGHLY PLOT 
48.8 DEGREES.LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND TRY ANOTHER ONE.HERE WE HAVE 10 THETA = 3.54.SO, AGAIN, 
IN ORDER TO FIND THETAWE CAN TAKE THE ARC TANGENTOR THE INVERSE TANGENT 
OF BOTH SIDES.AND, AGAIN, THESE TWO 
UNDO EACH OTHERAND THE RESULT IS JUST THETA.AND NOW WE CAN FIND THIS 
ON OUR GRAPHING CALCULATOR.SO RIGHT ABOVE THE TANGENT 
WE HAVE THE ARC TANGENTOR THE INVERSE TANGENT KEY.PRESS SECOND TANGENT.TYPE IN 3.54, AND THIS RETURNS 
THE ANGEL ROUGHLY 74.2 DEGREES.THERE'S A LOT MORE TO SAY ABOUT 
INVERSE TRIGOMETRIC FUNCTIONS.HOWEVER, FOR RIGHT NOW 
WE'RE JUST GOING TO USE THEMTO FIND ANGLES 
GIVEN A TRIG FUNCTIONS VALUE,AND ALSO TO SOLVE 
RIGHT TRIANGLES.SO HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE.WE WANT TO SOLVE 
THE GIVEN RIGHT TRIANGLEIF A = 44.3 CENTIMETERS, 
AND B = 55.9 CENTIMETERS.LET'S CALL THIS ANGLE A, 
ANGLE B, ANGLE C.SO SIDE A ACROSS FROM ANGLE A, 
44.3 CENTIMETERS.B, 55.9 CENTIMETERS.WE NEED TO FIND THE HYPOTENUSE 
AND THE INTERIOR ANGLESOF THIS TRIANGLE.WE CAN FIND THE HYPOTENUSE BY 
USING THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM.C SQUARED 
= A SQUARED + B SQUARED.SO C WILL EQUAL THE SQUARE ROOT 
OF THIS.LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND GO TO OUR CALCULATOR.AND C IS APPROXIMATELY 
71.3 CENTIMETERS.NOW, WE NEED TO FIND ANGLE A 
AND ANGLE B AS WELL.AND SO WHAT WE CAN DO NOW IS-- 
SO IF WE LOOK AT ANGLE A,WE CAN PICK ANY OF THE THREE 
GEOMETRIC FUNCTIONS.LET'S LOOK AT TANGENT.THE TANGENT OF ANGLE AMUST EQUAL THE RATIO 
OF THE OPPOSITE SIDETO THE ADJACENT SIDE.SO 44.3 DIVIDED BY 55.9.AND WE CAN FIND ANGLE AIF WE TAKE THE ARC TANGENT 
OF BOTH SIDES.THE LEFT SIDE WILL GIVE US 
ANGLE A.AND WE CAN FIND THIS VALUE 
ON THE GRAPHING CALCULATOR.SO SECOND TANGENT.AND WE CAN SEE OUR ANGLE 
IS ROUGHLY 38.4 DEGREES.NOW, WE KNOW 
THAT THESE TWO ANGLES, A AND BMUST BE COMPLEMENTARY.SO IF 90 - 38.4 WOULD GIVE US 
51.6 DEGREES FOR ANGLE B,AND WE HAVE SOLVED 
THE RIGHT TRIANGLE.LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ONE MORE.FIND THE ANGLES IN THE THREE, 
FOUR, FIVE RIGHT TRIANGLE.REMEMBER THREE, FOUR, FIVEIS ONE OF THOSE SPECIAL 
RIGHT TRIANGLES.BUT WE NEVER TALK ABOUT THAT 
THE ANGLES OF THAT TRIANGLE ARE.AND NOW 
WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE IT OUT.SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND JUST CALL 
THIS ANGLE A, ANGLE B,AND ANGLE C.WE NEED TO FIND ANGLE A 
AND ANGLE B.SO IF I TAKE LOOK AT ANGLE A--I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD 
AND USE SIN THIS TIME.SO IF THE SIN OF ANGLE 
A MUST EQUAL THE OPPOSITEOR THE HYPOTENUSE.SO SIN OF A IS EQUAL TO 3/5.SO, AGAIN, 
IN ORDER TO FIND ANGLE A,I CAN TAKE THE INVERSE SIN 
OF BOTH SIDES.SO THE LEFT SIDE WILL HAVE 
ANGLE A,AND THE RIGHT SIDE 
WILL GO TO OUR CALCULATOR.WE WANT THE INVERSE SIN OF 3/5.SO SECOND SIN 3/5.IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ROUGHLY 
36.9 DEGREES.AND, AGAIN, 
THESE TWO ARE COMPLIMENTARY.SO 90 - 36.9 WILL GIVE US 
53.1 DEGREES FOR ANGLE B.AND THAT TRIANGLE IS SOLVED.AGAIN, WE WILL DISCUSS MUCH MOREABOUT INVERSE TRIGOMETRIC 
FUNCTIONS LATER,BUT FOR RIGHT NOW WE CAN USE 
THIS INFORMATIONTO SOLVE RIGHT TRIANGLES.I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS VIDEO 
HELPFUL.HAVE A GOOD DAY.
