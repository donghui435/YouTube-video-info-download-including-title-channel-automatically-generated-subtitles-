this recording is taken from math apinrev.comthis is triangle ABC in which theperpendicular bisectors of each of thesides are drawn and this point is thecircumcenter to know if the circumcenteralways remains in sight irrespective ofthe type of the triangle we can changethe position of point a and observe thefigure while moving point a we can seethat as long as the triangle is acutewhich means all angles less than 90degrees the circumcenter remains insidethe triangle now let's move point a suchthat angle B becomes a right angle youcan see that the circumcenter lies hereon the hypotenuse ac it actually lies onthe midpoint of the hypotenuse so ifit's a right triangle the circumcenterwill not lie inside the triangle it willlie on the hypotenuse or you can saythat it will be the midpoint of thehypotenuse now let's try making angle Bobtuse yes we can see that thecircumcenter moves outside the triangleso if the triangle is obtuse thecircumcenter will lie outside thetriangle remember if acute then insidethe triangle if right-angled then on themidpoint of the hypotenuse if obtusethen outside the triangle let's look atright and obtuse case separately this ishow it will look for a right triangleall the perpendicular bisectors meet atthe midpoint of the hypotenuse whatabout an obtuse triangle this is how itwould look for an obtuse triangle thecircumcenter will lie outside thetriangle this angle is obtuse and thecircumcenter is this point where all theperpendicular bisectors meet thecircumcenter is actually the center ofthe circumcircle circumcircle iscircle that passes through all thevertices of a triangle for the righttriangle the circumcirclewill look something like this this is acircle drawn with the circumcenter asthe center and half the hypotenuse asthe radius all the vertices lie on thecircumcirclethe circumcircle of this obtuse trianglewill be huge so we need to zoom out abit it will be drawn like thisthis is the circumcircle of the obtusetriangle the more obtuse the anglebecomes the larger the circumcircle willgetyou
