hi this is pressed L occur in this videowe'll discuss the length of a helix or aspiral consider a cylinder where we havea spiral that's drawn from the bottom ofone end to the top of the other thatloops around one time the puzzle is whatis the length of this spiral we're goingto say the cylinder has a height of 3and the circumference of the base willbe equal to 4 can you figure out whatthe length of the spiral is go ahead andgive it a try when you have a solutionor you're ready you can keep watching tosee the solution that we present allright you could solve this byparameterizing the spiral and using theequation for arc length but being apuzzle there's a trick we unwrap thecylinder to form a rectangle and now thespiral is the diagonal of this rectanglethis rectangle has a height of 3 and thelength of the rectangle will be thecircumference of the circle which isequal to 4 so we can solve for thelength of the spiral as the length ofthe hypotenuse of the right trianglewith legs 3 & 4 and this will be equalto 5 did you solve it I hope you likedthis video please subscribe to mychannel you can support me on patreoncatch me on my blog mind your decisionson Twitter at pressure Locker and youcan get my books listed on my website
