A photo finishing store charges
customers a rate of$0.29 per photo to
print pictures.For new customers, the
store offers aone-time discount of $3.Write a function representing
the amount that a new customerwould have to pay to have x
number of photos printed.So x is the number of
photos printed.So just a regular customer would
have to pay the numberof photos times $0.29 a photo.So if we just said, let y be
the amount that a customerwould have to pay, a regular
customer would have to pay xtimes $0.29 per photo.So we'd write 0.29-- we could
put the dollar sign there ifyou want-- or 0.29-- we're
assuming everything isdollars-- x.That's how much a regular
customer would have to pay.But they're asking us a first
time, a new customer.And they say that the new
customer gets a one-timediscount of $3.So a new customer will
pay this minus $3.So this right here is pretty
much a simplified version of afunction that would describe
what a new customer would pay.If you wanted to get fancy,
this is a little bitinaccurate when the customer
ordered less than 10 photosbecause, let's say the customer
orders 10 photos.Then x is going to be 10 times
$0.29 is $2.90 minus 3 isnegative $0.10.The customer is not going to
pay negative $0.10, whichwould be like the store paying
them $0.10 for them to print10 photos, the customer's not
going to pay anything.So what we could do if we wanted
to make this a littlebit fancier, we could say that a
new customer would pay-- andthen we can say that's y, so y
is equal to 0.29x minus 3 if xis greater than 10, if the
guy or the gal ordersmore than 10 photos.It's 0 otherwise.Then they don't pay anything.If it's less than 10 photos,
they pay nothing.It's not like the store's going
to pay them, because ifyou're less than 10, or 10 or
less, actually, then this isgoing to become negative and
we don't want a situationwhere it's negative.So they're either going to pay
nothing, but if they get morethan 10 photos, then they're
going to pay based on thisfunction right there.
