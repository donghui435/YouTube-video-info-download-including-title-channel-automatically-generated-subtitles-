we've all been told that to divide afraction we need to multiply by itsreciprocal for example if we were askedto work out say 2/3 divided by 4/7 theclinic retold as youngsters is to saywhy literally make this 2/3 times 7/4 toget the answer1412 or 7 sixths fine that's all goodand dandy but you must admit that thisprocess is kind of mysterious why isthis division this Ovilus here's thename of that symbol suddenly changed toa multiplication by multiplying by thereciprocal of the fraction so theoriginal fraction itself so let's see wecan explore this question why isdividing by a fraction the same asmultiplying by its reciprocal let's bevery clear about it in the process andin order to be very clear we need tounderstand first and fully what is afraction in the first place so when Iwrite something like 6 excuse me to getthe pen when I write something like 6tooth 6 divided by 2 it's really adivision problem I have say six pies toshare mark say two boys that's clearlygood and give me three pies per boy sohow do I check this 3 times 2 is indeed6 or 20 pies cheered amongst five boysreally is going to be the freshened fourwell for once I'm showing one pieamongst two boys really is a meaningfulanswer it's called half a pie as we callone tooth 1/2 and so on so a fraction isreally a division problem nothing morethan thatOh one of the beautiful things aboutfractions which is also one of the mostannoying things about them is that theirrepresentation is not unique for exampleif I said three pies for four boys wellI can actually get the same result if Idouble the number of pies and alsodouble the number of boys that doesn'tchange anythingthere'll be six pies for eight boys isactually give the same amount of Piperboy as three Bias pies for four boyswell if they're still I tripled thenumber of pies and tripled number ofboys nothing's going to change us to bethe same answer nine pies for 12 boysmust be the same as the original threepies for four or hi multiplied by tenmillion and to another ten million intwo doesn'tso if this key fraction rule have a piesfor b-boys if I multiply the number ofpies up by some factor and multiply thenumber boys up by the same factornothing changesthis is the key technique C key stepthat makes all the fractions work theway they do in factories do you do itexplain this more fully have a look atthis fraction guide that's available atthe website just just download it it'sall there all right but to get to thereciprocal problem let's look at somemore complicated by sharing problemssuppose I asked us to share excuse melet's say two and a third pies amongst 4and 2/5 voice 2 which you'd sayyech go away that's horrendous but if Ifollow the key fraction rule I canmultiply the numerator the denominatoreach by common factor and a word changethe problem and in fact if I choose nicefactors I can make a problem that's nicenice and easy for myself I choose tomultiply the top by 3 and also thebottom by 3 that is the beautifulVantage 2 and 1/3 times 3 well 2 times 3is 6 plus 1/3 times 3 is 1/2 the topline is actually 7 bottom line is we 4times 3 is 12 plus 2/5 times 3 6 fifthsare still pretty nasty but so far I have7 12 plus 6 fifths I've made the topnice the bottom is still a bit messy butI can fix up the bottom by again bychoosing clever clever choice effectivefor the top and for the numerator thedenominator let's multiply each by 5this time so 7 divided by 12 plus 6fifths is really the same as 35 dividedby 12 times 5 is 60 plus 6 fifths times5 is 666 so 2 and 1/3 pies sharedamongst four and two-fifths of a boy isthe same as she ranked 35 pies among 66boys beautiful not too hard let's tryanother onesuppose I wish to say sharetwo-and-a-half pies amongst three and ahalf boys that I've made this a veryeasy one clearly there's a nice choiceof whateither top and bottom by let's multiplyeach by two that's the same as sharingfive poised pies amongst seven boys nottoo bad ah let's now do one that looks alittle bit nastylet's have say two-thirds of a pie to beshared amongst to four sevenths of a boyall right we can do this the top linesof fraction most people don't likefractions let's pretend I don't likefractions either let's get rid of thefraction you multiply this by cleverchoice oh yes let's choose three andwhat I do to the top I got to keep itbalanced by doing to the bottom scaleboth up on the same factor so thatdoesn't change the problem the top linenow becomes 2/3 times three that's toone line now becomes gosh twelvesevenths that bottom lines a bit of amess is a clever choice a fraction forthe bottom perfect for the bottom lineyes let's multiply this by seven andthis by seven and we now have 14twelfths my goodness that's the problemby just first tiled with two thirdsdivided by four sevenths there it is wehave 1412not a reciprocal in sight let's do thislittle more abstractly see what's goingon doesn't it up to done let's look at apies for b-boys divided by C by pies forD girls that is what's the fashion abeats divided by CDs very strange wellas the nice choice for top and bottom tomultiply by a factor by my factor sorryno injures off then yes a small pie thetop by B and let's Mull by the bottom byB while we're at it we can be cleverlet's also multiply at the bottom by Dand therefore the top by DS well that'snot changed my fraction what is the topbecome well the top is ad and the bottomis C and the DS will cancel B so there'sa general formula for eight beatsdivided by C deaths up if I look at thisthis really is my original fraction abeatstimes D over C that's the reciprocallike magic is just fallen into place soto practice this idea let me give yousome little pieces of magic as yourchallenge your homework after watchingthis little video to see if you explainwhy they're true little example if wedid say 2020 once divided by 4/7 theanswer shall be okay2020 once times 7/4 which is a hundredand forty over was that 84 I'm sure as acommon factor something around there anddivided by four that gives me 35 and 20months all right grantI believe all that goes even further wasthat sets of five and this is three buthere's something anything very curioussorry about that pause I look at thiswhat's 20 divided by 4 and what's 21divided by 7 my pen is not working onany couples today all right 25 by 4 is 5and 21 divided by 7 is 3it's that here's my question is it truein general that a beats / CDs isactually a divided by C over B dividedby D did I just choose some numberswhich by quittance happen to work thisway what is true in general homeworkquestion number one yes I'm a questionnumber two some teachers have kidsperform division of fractions as followsif they want to work out 20 20 once /4/7 they say put these fractions over acommon denominator all right 20 once andsevenths I guess I need to multiply thisthis latter guy while so I'll keep 20once on the bottom but if 4/7 I never do12:20 once then they claim ignore thebottomthe answers going to be just thenumerators / to each other a divided byfour that gives me 5/3 which is theanswer that I had before so here's mynext question is a beats / C teethsreally answer of well the right personand symbols for the server commondenominator and then just divide thenumerators very curious that true ingeneral or is that just a littleartificeactually I do explore I do store theseissues and many other things in thisguide so feel free to have a look at thefraction guide
