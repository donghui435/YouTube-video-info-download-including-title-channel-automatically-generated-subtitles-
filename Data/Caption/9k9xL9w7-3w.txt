today in January 2011those are breakthrough in a famous toughunsolved problem mathematics time to dowith the petition numbers in this videoI'd like to give a brief introduction towhat the petition numbers are give someresults about them and I'll try to provesome things about them too and then givea sense of what Kent owner and hiscolleagues announced a couple of monthsago about their breakthroughokay petition numberswhat are they what's really child's playactually so here's a game here are someblocks and imagine I'm just in mysandpit and playing with my blocks and Iwant to make trains suppose I want tomake trains the four units long but I'vegot lots of elderly that a one unit widetwo units wide three four five unitsword maybe six seven eight anotherbuckets down the road so I'm going toask how many trains can I make usingblocks of these dimensions well I meanmight range is simply a row of blocksthat make elect the fall which I'd liketo put three and one together and thatmakes a train which I'll describe asthree plus one of like four I guess Icould also actually put it in this orderand have a train of one plus three andthe question is how many differenttrains can I make with these blocksthere's there's two examples I guessI'll keep playing this game I can studyinto a train of two plus two and maybe atrain of just a block of four itself notvery exciting train but it's a train ahmaybe I could do with the table so becomplicated now I can do to one'sattitude okay so one plus one plus twoand I guess I could rearrange that intoa train of one plus two plus one all Iguess I can arrange rearrange that aswell into a train of two plus one plusone some people might not like thesethey might say that's basically the sameexample over and over against adifferent order that's a good issuelet's let's talk about ordered a momentbut I think I can still make some moretrains so what another train I can makelet's see I can do four ones and if Ireel to those it doesn't matter thatwould ever be the same answer so I guessanother option is for ones one plus oneplus one plus oneI've done very good Bohr technique herebut sort of round the room but it lookslike out of one two three four five sixseven eight there are eight ways to makea trainer for using my collection ofblocksthat's if I consider order important sofour blocks on a train sorry for a chainof like the four blocks if all isimportant it looks like there are eightways to do it if what is not importantlet's see not treasures handwritingexcuse meI guess those two examples would bedeemed the same now that example will belegitimateI guess the block of four is fine Iguess we decided those three would bedeemed the same and that set there thenthe how I ordered is could still be thesame so it looks like there's only onetwo three four five unordered partitionsof the number four I just use the wordpartition that's the official math wordfor ways to break down the number inthis case the number four into somesmaller parts it could be the wholenumber itself could be a whole bunch ofones could be things in between sothere's two types of petition numbersout there the ordered partitions and theunordered partitions let me talk aboutthose nextso just seeing if you want to make atrain at length for and I care about theorder of the blocks I use there areeight ways to make your train of lengthfour I may want to pause and play withus for a while and then she tried tofill in this table yourself butobviously first up is easy anyway it'sgoing to make a train of length one Iguess is just one way that I can fill inthese getting for numbers two three andcertainly for the higher numbers anywaysgoing to make a train of length twoif orders considered important well yourblock of length two or we do two onesthere's like there's only two ways nottoo badthree could be three ones it could bethree itself a good block of two and oneor can we block of one and two sothere's four ways to make a train oflength three exit exercise for you maybejust pause for a moment or play withthat turns out those sixteen ways tomake a train your length five which isthose thirty two ways to make a train oflength 6 and if you look at thesenumbers you suspect there might be anice mathematical formula going on herein fact it looks like a train at lengthand we have the number of possibilitiesis 2 to the 1 less than and whoops themup the number of Alden partitions is 2to the N minus 1 now why is that truehow can I prove that so really making atrain of length bands whose name isreaching it by Arisa which is thesehandy-dandy tissue how can I make atrain of length 4 well I take the basicfour blocks how could I look at thesefour blocks and see that there'sactually eight ways to make a trainlength 4 well there are three spacesbetween the blocks if I put a plus signin each of the spaces that representsthe solution one plus one plus one plusone measure if I chose not to put a plussign between the spaces and I've I'lldetermine a do well without Ella regarda lack of plus side as gluingso there's no plus side in that space inothers like our competition two plus oneplus one or maybe instead I'll choosenot to put a plus sign in the middle andbottom on a plus sign at the end this isvery smudgy but I will put a plus signin the middle they are the firstposition and like a plus sign meansgluing and a suddenlooks like I've got the train one plusthree so actually making partitions withorchids are important of length 4 isequivalent just simply choosing to put aplus sign in space or not to put a plussign of space there are two choices foreach space there are three spaces thetotal number choices must be two to thethree ways to make an order train oflength 4 that's 8 that explains ingeneral for n there are 2 to the N minus1 possible trains if all is consideredimportant because there are n minus 1spaces each space has two choices allright that's the ordered partitions nota break through thereit's the unordered partitions that areinterestingall right we have the ordered partitionnumbers licked their just powers of twonow that's movin on the unorderedpartition numbers here all thepartitions of the number for Isis orderdoesn't matter we get all of themanywhere we like it's become theconvention always put the higher numbersfirst and the small numbers near the endso the petitions of the number four wehave for itselfthree plus 1/2 plus two and two plus oneplus one and a whole bunch of ones sothere are the five and orderedpartitions of the number four in factwhen the mathematician says the petitionnumbers they usually think of these onesthan ways to do an order petitions ofthe number of each particular number sowhat's going onhere's n P then let's make stand for thenth petition number and we've just shownthe fourth one is five now you here'ssome fun and games if you like playingwith these blocks make sure you fill inthis table yourself example there's onlyone way to petition number one just haveone itself - can be - or could be oneplus one so there's two ways for digitnumber two number three is that thereare three ways 1 + 1 + 1 2 + 1 + 3itself and then things get a bit harderfor 5 it turns out there are seven waysto petition the number five you mightwant to check that the number six thereeleven ways and right now we should begetting excited because look at thesenumbers one two three five seven eleventhese are the primesso actually in order find the a formulafor the petition numbers always to do isfind a form with the primes it seems hmmthat's not be easy question ahunfortunately don't be fooled bypatterns forfeit 7 toes out of 15 waysto petition the number 7 and thenthere's twenty two ways to petition thenumber 8 not only check this and that'sdefinitely not prime for 9 I believeit's 30 ways for 10 I believe there's 42ways now I don't have these othernumbers in my head put on my trusty bitof paper these numbers tend to grow for20 it turns out they're 627 ways topetition number 20optional exercise double check that for50 things start to get a little bithairyit's 2004 two hundred twenty six ways topetition the number 50 for 100 thesethings grow mightyfirst try 190 million nine hundred sixtynine two hundred ninety two differentways and for a thousand I'm not going towrite the number it's about thirty twoto just long it's two point four timesten to the 31 there is a huge numberthese partition numbers grow incrediblyfast incredibly quickly so the unsolvedproblem that's out there well maybe notanymore lies of January 20 2011 is is itpossible to find a formula for thesepartition numbers there's been aroundfor centuries and the first person wemake a good crack at that was Leonardoil in the 1700syou
