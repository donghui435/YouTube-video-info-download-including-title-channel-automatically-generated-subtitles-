hey this is presto Walker from eachcorner of a parallelogram draw two linesegments to connect the corner to themidpoints of the opposite sides theseeight line segments bound in octagonwhat is the ratio of the octagons areato the parallelograms area thischallenging problem was given to eighthgrade students in Russia now one of thedifficulties of this problem is eventrying to draw the diagram so let me getthat started for you we start out withthe parallelogram now from each cornerwe'll draw two line segments to connectthe corner to the midpoints of theopposite sides we need to do that foreach of the four corners of theparallelogram in total we've drawn eightline segments and these line segmentsbound in octagon the question is what isthe ratio of the octagons area to theparallelograms area can you figure itout give this problem a try and whenyou're ready keep watching the video forthe solution so I hope you've given thisproblem a try and before I present thesolution I'm going to admit that I couldnot solve this problem there's just toomuch information and I wasn't able tofigure out the way to approach thisproblem to figure out the areas sowhat's the correct answer the answer is1/6 the amazing thing is that the answerapplies for any parallelogram which willinclude rectangles and even squares so Iwas stumped by this problem but howwould an eighth grader figure it outwell I looked up some solutions onlineand there are many different ways youcould do it some involving morecomplicated mathematical methodsthe method I will present in this videouses only basic geometric principles thesolution was emailed to me by MichaelKay who also suggested the problem sothe idea is to consider theparallelogram and divide it even to evensmaller parallelograms and we'll end upfinding some patterns the first step isto slice the octagon like a pizza intofour pieces of equal area by connectingopposite midpoints of the parallelogramlet me get started with some notationlet P be the parallelograms area and letX equal the octagons area we'researching for the ratio X over P so howis dividing this parallelogram going tohelp us well each quarter of the octagonhas an equal area therefore each quarterwill be equal to x over 4 next we'vedivided the parallelogram into foursmaller parallelograms and each of thesewill have 1/4 the area of theparallelogram so each of these will be Pover 4 now what we'll do is we'll takeone of these smaller parallelograms andthen we'll do the same thing so let'szoom into the parallelogram in the upperright quadrantlet's now connect the midpoints ofopposite side in this parallelogram todivide it into four smallerparallelograms each of these foursmaller parallelograms love one quarterthe area of the previous smallparallelogram so one fourth of P overfour will be P over sixteen now we'regoing to do this even one more timelet's focus on one of these smallerparallelograms and let's zoom in onemore time let's focus on just thisparallelogram and what happens if weconnect midpoints on opposite sides ofthis parallelogramonce again we're getting closer to thearea of this quarter of the octagon sowe again have four smallerparallelograms that'll be one quarterthe area of the previous parallelogramsso one quarter of P over 16 will be Pover 64 so we figured out one portion ofthe quarter of this octagon we now canlook at the rest of the portions of theoctagon in this little grid in the nextgrid just above we have a portion of theoctagon which is a trapezoid now thistrapezoid will have an area that's 3/4of the area of this small parallelogramso it'll be 3/4 of P over 64 this isbecause each trapezoid is a smallparallelogram minus a triangle that has1/4 the area of the small parallelogramin other words this portion is 3/4 timesP over 64 and we also have anothertrapezoid that's going to be 3/4 times Pover 64so we now have one final piece of theOctagon in this grid so what's this areawell look at the shape of this area ifwe expand it and scale it up it'sexactly going to be one quarter of theOctagon and we can scale it back down inother words this last piece is ascaled-down shape of the 1/4 slice ofthe octagon as we've scaled by 1/4 2times that means the area of thescale-down piece will be 1/4 times 1/4times x over 4 which is 1/4 of theoctagon therefore this will be X dividedby 64 so we're now pretty much ready tosolve the problem we have one expressionfor the area of 1/4 of the octagon as xover 4 and we've just figured outanother expression for 1/4 of theOctagonit'll be the sum of these areas that's Pover 64 plus 2 times the area of atrapezoid which is 3/4 times P over 64plus X over 64 because these expressionsboth represent the area of 1/4 of theoctagon we can set these expressionsequal to each otherwe can now bring the terms of X on theleft in terms of P on the right we canthen simplify and then we can dividethrough to get that the ratio of x overP is equal to 1/6 and that's our answerso I hope you could follow all of thosesteps with the zooming in but in caseyou didn't let me just present it on oneslide we divide the parallelogram byconnecting midpoints of opposite sidesthis gives 1/4 slice of the octagon intoeach of these parallelograms so if Xover 4 as each of these quarter sliceswe then divide the upper right quadrantor any of these quadrants one more timeby connecting the midpoints and then wedo it one more time we then have onequarter slice of the octagon in thissmall little grid of four parallelogramsthe smallest parallelogram will have anarea of P over 64 due to the scaling wecan then figure out the area thetrapezoids as three fourths of the areathe small parallelogram and then we havejust one more shape and that's going tobe similar to the entire one quartersslice of the octagon therefore we knowthis will be equal to x over 64 so we'vededuced two different ways to figure outthe area of one quarter slice of theoctagon we set these two expressionsequal to each other and then solve forthe ratio of x over P to be 1/6 so it'sa remarkable solution that only dependson connecting the midpoints of theparallelogram and then deducing the restof the areas from basic geometricprinciples did you figure it out andwhich method did you use to solve thisproblem thanks for watching this videoplease subscribe to my channel I makevideos on math
