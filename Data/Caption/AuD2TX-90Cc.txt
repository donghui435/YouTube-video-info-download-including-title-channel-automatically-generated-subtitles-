We're asked to write this right
here in word form, andI'm not saying it out loud
because that would give theanswer away.We have 63.15 that we want
to write in word form.Well, the stuff to the left of
the decimal point is prettystraightforward.Let me actually color code it.So we have 6, 3.Let me do it all in
different colors.And then we have a decimal, and
then we have a 1 and a 5.There's one common way of doing
this, but we'll talkabout the different ways you
could express this as a word.But we know how to write
this stuff to the left.This is pretty straightforward.This is just sixty-three.Let me write that down.So this is sixty-three.And instead of the decimal,
we'll write, and.Now there's two ways
to go here.We could say, and one tenth
and five hundredths, or wecould just say, look, this
is fifteen hundredths.One tenth is ten hundredths.So one tenth and five hundredths
is fifteenhundredths.So maybe I can write it like
this: sixty-three and fifteenhundredths.Just like that.Now, it might have been a little
bit more natural tosay, how come I don't say
one tenth and then fivehundredths?And you could, but that would
just make it a little bitharder for someone's brain to
process it when you say it.So it could have been
sixty-three-- so let me copyand paste that.It could be sixty-three and, and
then you would write, onetenth for this digit right
there, and five hundredths.Sixty-three and one tenth and
five hundredths is hard formost people's brains
to process.But if you say, fifteen
hundredths, people get whatyou're saying.Not to beat a dead horse, but
this right here, this is 1/10right here and then this
is 5/100, 5 over 100.But if you were to add these
two, If you were to add 1/10plus 5/100 -- so
let's do that.If you were to add 1/10 plus
5/100, how would you do it?You need a common denominator.100 is divisible by both 10 and
100, so multiply both thenumerator and denominator
of this character by 10.You get 10 on the top and
100 on the bottom.1/10 is the same thing
as 10 over 100.10/100 plus 5/100 is equal to
15 over 100, so this pieceright here is equal to 15/100.And that's why we say
sixty-three and fifteenhundredths.
