look at the decimal fractions on theboard seventeen point four five twohundred ninety two point three two andone point four nine what do you think iscommon amongst all three all three ofthem have the same number of digits inthe decimal part two two and twosuch decimal fractions are calledlike decimal fractions remember samenumber of digits after the decimal pointon the right hand side let's look atanother set of decimal fractions twelvepoint four six fifteen point one ninefive and two hundred twenty three pointthree nine one four here the number ofdigits after the decimal point are notthe same such numbers are called unlikedecimal fractions it was easy right solet me ask you a very simple questioncan we convert unlike decimal fractionsto like once to understand that we needto understand a very simple concept lookat the number four point six four is inthe ones place and six is in the tenthsplace so this number can be written asfour times one plus six times 1 by 10now look at four point six zero with thesame logic this can be written as fourtimes one plus six times 1 by 10 plus 0times 1 by 100 zero multiplied by anynumber is always zero so essentiallythis value is equal to this value whichmeans four point six and four point sixzero have the same numerical value whatabout four point six zero zero it equalsfour times one plus six times 1 by 10plus 0 times 1 by 100 plus zero timesone by one thousand as these two termsare zero we can surely conclude thatfour point six zero zero has the samenumerical value as four point sixit means that if we add zeroes on theright after the last digit of thedecimal part the value of the numberdoes not change now look at thisquestion we have to convert these threedecimal fractions into like decimalfractions as the number of digits afterthe decimal point are not the same wecan say they are unlike to convert theminto like decimal fractions the firstthing we need to do is find the decimalfraction which has the highest number ofdigits after the decimal point it's thisone as it has three digits after thedecimal point and the other two have 2and 1 respectively now all we reallyneed to do is make sure that we havethree digits after the decimal point ofeach number and to do that we just addzeros at the end of the number the firstnumber is two point nine two to havethree digits after the decimal point wejust add one zero so two point nine tozero and 495 point three nine threealike decimal fractions the next decimalfraction we have is fourteen point oneto get three digits after the decimalpoint we need to add two zeros here sothese two decimal fractions become likewe keep the third one as this 495 pointthree nine three that's how we convertunlike decimal fractions to like onesnow we look at one last concept in thisvideo what are equivalent decimalfractions to decimals fractions areequivalent if they have the same valuelook at these three pairs of numbers arezero point six five and two point sixfive equivalent we can see that thedigits after the decimal point are samein both the cases but the integral partis different it means these two decimalfractions do not have the same valuethese two decimal fractions are notprivileged what about these two theintegral part is the same but thedecimal parts are 4 2 & 4 2 0 but we hadseen that adding zeros to the right ofthe decimal part does not change itsvalue so the value of these two decimalfractions is essentially the same theyare equivalent decimal fractions whatabout these two decimal fractions theintegral part is the same and in thedecimal part we have just added zeroswhich shouldn't change the value rightno that's incorrect adding a zero beforethe last digit of the decimal part willchange the value so point zero five isnot the same as point five these twodecimal fractions are not equivalentyou
