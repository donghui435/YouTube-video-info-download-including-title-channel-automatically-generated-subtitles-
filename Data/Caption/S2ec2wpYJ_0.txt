welcome to another one of my math videoshere we have a really cool problem thatdemonstrates the power of exponentialgrowth so as you can see we have theearth in the moon and the distancebetween the Earth and the moon is384,000 kilometers now on the earth wehave a piece of paper now this is atypical piece of paper so it's not drawnto scale and the thickness of a typicalpiece of paper is 0.1 millimeters so thequestion for this brainteaser is howmany times do you need to fold thispiece of paper before it becomes thickenough to reach the moon now once againthe thickness of this paper is 0.1millimeters and you can assume that youcan fold this piece of paper as manytimes as you would like even though theworld record for folding a piece ofpaper is I think 12 times you can assumethat you can fold this as many times asyou want so how many folds would it takefor the thickness of this piece of paperto reach the moon so I decided to makethis brainteaser multiple choice do youthink you need to fold the paper a 42times B 42,000 times C 42 million timesor D 42 billion times so take your timethink about this problem if you want andpause the video now if you don't want tosee the solutionso let's start by looking at a side viewof this piece of paper once again thesepictures are not drawn to scale so weknow this piece of paper is 0.1millimeters thick and every time we foldit is going to double in thickness soafter one fold is going to be point twomillimeters thick after two folds isgoing to be point four millimeters thickand after three fold it's going to bepoint eight millimeters thick so I thinkyou get the idea by now so I'm going tospeed up the process a bit if we doublein thickness after every single foldafter ten folds the paper is going tohave a thickness of ten point twocentimeters now compared to the distanceof the moon which is 384,000 kilometerswe're still not even close but comparedto the original thickness of the paperthis is actually over a thousand timesthicker than 0.1 millimeters sobasically what we just did was wemultiplied 0.1 millimeters times two tothe tenth power now if we fold thispaper twenty times it's going to be 2 tothe 20th power times thicker which isten point five meters this is over amillion times thicker than the originalpiece of paper now if you're lookingfrom outer space the paper is not goingto get noticeably thick until about 40folds after 40 folds it's going to be ahundred and ten thousand kilometerswhich i think is a hundred and tenbillion millimeters but you think is onepoint one trillion times thicker thanour original piece of papernow if the paper is already this thickand we're doubling every time we fold itwe must be really close at 41 foldsit'll be two hundred and twenty thousandkilometers and at forty two folds wellwe will have reached the moon and thensome it'll be four hundred and fortythousand kilometers thick so let me knowwhat you thought about this brain teaserin the comments below did it blow yourmind knowing that a piece of paper onlyneeds to be folded 42 times to reach themoon or did you think this was boring ortoo easy let me know in the commentsbelow I hope you enjoyed it and I willsee you in my next video
