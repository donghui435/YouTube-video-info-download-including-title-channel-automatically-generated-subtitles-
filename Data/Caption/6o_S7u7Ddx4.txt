all right in this video we're going totalk about finding a unit vector and theunit the unit vector for a vector V allwe do is we take our vector V and wedivide it by its magnitude or its lengthand what a unit vector is it's simply avector that points in the same directionas the original vector but we're goingto kind of alter its magnitude or lengthso that it has a magnitude or length ofone so nothing too terrible here let'sget three examples here let's find thecomponents of a unit vector in thedirection of each of these given vectorsso just to get vector here for it foreach one well so we've got the vectorthree comma four with components threecomma four let's find its magnitude youknow maybe we'll call this again vectorV so the magnitude of vector V again wejust take componentand we square if we add them togetherand square root of so 3 squared is 9 4squared is 16 that's going to give usthe square root of 25 which is simplygoing to give us 5 when we take thesquare root of it so really it says theunit vector would be this vector 3 withcomponents 3 4 but now we're dividing by5 and remember all that happens here youcan really think we're multiplying by ascalar which we are we're justmultiplying by 1/5 so we'll have 1/5being multiplied by the vector withcomponents 3 comma 4 and recall if youhave a real number out front all we dois just multiply it in so we'll get 3/5and 4/5 and that will give us our unitvector again it's going to be pointingoff in the exact same direction as theoriginal again but now it simply isgoing to have a length of 1
