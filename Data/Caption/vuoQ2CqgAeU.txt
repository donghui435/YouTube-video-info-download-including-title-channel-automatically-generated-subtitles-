so here in this video we're going tofind the circumference of a circle inthe formula that we use to find thecircumference is C is equal to 2 pitimes R and the C stands for thecircumference and pi is the never endingnumber which we usually round to 3.14and R is the radius of the circle andmost of the time for these problemsyou're given the radius so if you'regiven the radius you just need to plugit in to our formula and we can find ourcircumference however for thisparticular example we're given thediameter of the circle notice how thecircle has a diameter of 10 meters wellthe good news is is that if you're giventhe diameter it is really easy to findthe radius the radius is always one halfof the diameter and I'll write this downfor you here below just so it's easierfor you to remember so once again theradius is equal to 1/2 of the diameterso if we know that the diameter is equalto 10 then we know that the radius is1/2 of 10 so the radius is going to be 5meters and now that we know our radiuswe can use our circumference formula thecircumference is equal to 2 pi allmultiplied by our radius and now we knowthat our radius is 5 meters so I'm goingto plug in 5 meters for the radius andnow the only thing that we have left isjust multiplying we have 2 multiplied by5 so 2 times 5 is equal to 10 we stillhave our pi and we still have our unitswhich is meters so the exactcircumference of the circle in meters is10 PI but a lot of times your teacher oryour textbook want your answer indecimal form so in order to do this weneed to round PI into a decimal so theapproximate value for pi is equal to3.14 so I'm going to plug ina 3.14 4pi and once again we still can'tforget about our units which is metersand finally the only thing left is justmultiplying if you plug in ten times3.14 into your calculator we get 31point four and once again we can'tforget about our units which is metersso the circumference is approximatelyequal to 31 point four meters and thecircumference is just this outer edge ofthe circle or you could say the outerboundary of the circle so the distanceof this outer boundary of the circle is31 point four meters
