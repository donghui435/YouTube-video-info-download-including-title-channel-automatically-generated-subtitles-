hi this is Mario with Mario's mathtutoring coming to you with another mathvideo to help you boost your score inyour math class improve yourunderstanding and hopefully make math alot less stressful so in this videowe're going to talk about is how toconvert from fractions to decimals topercentages and any which order so whatwe're going to do here in this video iswe're going to talk about this chartright here and just whether you're givena fraction decimal or percentage how toconvert it into the other formats solet's start up here with five-eighthswe're going to convert from five-eighthsas a fraction to a decimal now when youhave a fraction when you see thisdivision bar this fraction bar canthat's really like a division sign sothis is really like five is beingdivided by eight so let's go ahead andlook at that so we've got five who'sbeing divided by eight or how many timesdoes 8 go into five so if you don't seethe decimal point it's going to be hereon the right side of the number okayfive and so what we're gonna do is we'rejust gonna go ahead and see how manytimes does 8 go into five well it goesin zero times does 8 go into 50 yes itgoes into 50 6 times 6 times 8 is 48we're subtracting we get 20 okay justbring down the zero it goes into 20 twotimes okay we subtract again bring downanother zero okay8 goes into 40 five times and that goesin evenly so we have as a decimal pointsix two five so let's go ahead and addthat to our chart here 0.625 now toconvert from a decimal to a percentagewhat we do is we take that decimal pointand we move it one two places to theright so it's just like this one twoplaces to the right now we have 62 pointfive percent okay so you're with me sofar we're gonna do some more exampleshere they're giving us the decimal pointto two now point two two is kind of likea shorthand way a little bit of asleighing way of saying what thisdecimal is this is actually 22hundredths now you can see that you wantto look at the last place that the thenumber has here which is theplace tens hundreds thousands right soit's in the hundreds place so if youpronounce that correctly it's twenty twohundredths which means that thisfraction is 22 divided by a hundred butyou can reduce that further to elevenfiftieth by dividing the numerator anddenominator by two so we're justreducing it to lowest form now to goagain from the decimal to the percentthat's pretty easy we just have to movethe decimal point one two places to theright so that's gonna be twenty twopercent okaynow in the next example they're givingus a percentage a hundred and fortypercent how do we go from a hundredforty percent back to a decimal wellhere what we're doing is we're actuallygoing to be moving the decimal point tothe left two places so this is actuallyone point four zero or you could justsay one point four another way to lookat it is percent per means divided bycent means hundred like a hundred centsand a dollar a hundred years in acentury a hundred feet on a centipedeand so on so percent you can think ofthis as a hundred and forty per 100 andthat'll also help us to convert thisinto a fraction okay which is a hundredforty over a hundred and we can reducethat to 14 over ten which is seven overfive or if you want to write it as amixed number one and two fifthsfive goes into seven one whole time withtwo left over so one and two fifths okaylet's just do a few more examples I hopeyou're enjoying these videos let's takea look at this example here two fifthswe want to convert that to a decimalright so two divided by five so thefraction bar means divided by so let'sgo over to here two is being divided byfive 5 goes into 2-0 whole timesokay 5 goes into 20 four times fourtimes five is 20 with zero left over sowe can see our decimal is going to be0.4 so this is 0.4 okay now to convertfrom the decimal to the percent we'regoing to move that decimal point one twoplaces to the rightwe're gonna have to put a placeholderhere since there's not a number there sothat's going to be a zero so it's goingto be point fouror zero okay two more to go 3.27 shouldwe convert it to a percent or to afraction let's do the percent firstwe're gonna move the decimal two placesto the right that's three hundred andtwenty seven percent and that's a bigpercentage right and if we move it okayto the right two places that's ourpercent but now we're going to go to thedecimal form so this is really three andtwenty seven hundredths so we can yousee that decimal point you can say theword and three whole and twenty sevenhundredths again hundreds because thelast digit here is in the hundredthsplace so this is three and twenty sevenhundredths okay last example two percentwe're gonna be moving the decimal pointone two places to the left that's pointzero two okay or you can think of thisas two percent two per hundred to partsout of a hundred which that will help usto convert to our fraction form okaywhich is one fiftieth so there you haveit so I hope you're joining these videosif you are go ahead and subscribe to thechannel go ahead and check out some ofmy past videos and I look forward toseeing you in the next video I'll talkto you soon
