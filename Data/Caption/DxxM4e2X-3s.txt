so now let's go over an example that'sjust a little bit different let's say wehave two point seven three five allbeing multiplied by a whole number offour so now I'm going to set these up sowe can multiply them together we havetwo point seven three five beingmultiplied by four so now remember thefirst thing that we have to do we needto multiply as if the decimals were noteven there so let's just multiply thesenumbers together as if that decimal didnot exist so we have four times fivewhich is just 20 carry the 2 4 times 3is 12 plus 2 is 14 carry the 1 4 times 7is 28 plus 1 is 29 carry the 2 4 times 2is 8 plus 2 is 10 so now here on ourfinal answer is when we need to go backto the original problem and count howmany numbers are to the right of thedecimal in our first number 2 point 7 35 we have one number to the right wehave two numbers to the right and wehave three numbers to the right of thedecimal and our 4 is a whole numberwhich has zero numbers to the right ofthe decimal so since we have three totalnumbers to the right of our decimal ourfinal answer also has to have threenumbers to the right of our decimal soI'm going to count our first 3 numbers 12 3 now I can place my point and noticehow we have three numbers in our finalanswer to the right of the decimal andyou should never have a trailing zero inyour final answer so our final answer isjust going to be 10 point nine four tenpoint nine four is exactly the same as10 point nine four zero so here are somevideos with some more example problemsrelated to the video you just watchedI really hope you're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you later
