Find the probability of
rolling doubles on twosix-sided dice, numbered
from 1 to 6.So let's just think about it.Let's think about all of the
outcomes, all of the possibleoutcomes, and then what fraction
of those outcomesrepresent us getting doubles.We want to roll doubles.So let's make a little table
here that'll give us all ofour outcomes.You have 6 outcomes on the first
dice, or the first die Ishould say.So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.So let's call this
the first die.And then the second die,
there are 6 outcomes.So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.This is the second die.So all of the different possible
outcomes are going tobe some-- you're going to get an
outcome-- so you could geta 3 over here.And then when you get a 3 on the
second die, you might havegotten a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
or 6 on the first die.Or you might have gotten a 5 on
the first die and then youcould get a 1, 2 3, 4, 5,
or 6 on the second die.So if I draw a grid here.If I were to draw a grid here,
let me do my best to draw aquick grid.Just draw it really fast. So
let me just draw this gridright here.Each cell of this grid, each
box in this grid, wouldrepresent an outcome.All of the possible outcomes.Let me finish drawing it.So there you go.And so just to get an
understanding of what I meanby it represents an outcome.This cell right here would
represent getting a 4 on yourfirst die and a 2 on
your second die.That's the outcome
it represents.It's one of the potential
outcomes.Now how many total outcomes
are there?Well you could look at the
area of this right here.The area of this is going
to be 6 times 6.You have 36 possible outcomes.So 36 possible outcomes.And it makes sense.You can think about
the first die.There's 6 outcomes.And then for each of those 6
outcomes, you have 6 possibleoutcomes for the second die.So 6 times 6.Or you can think of in
this grid, it hasexactly 36 cells in it.Now what are the outcomes that
satisfy our conditions?That entail us getting
doubles?What are the outcomes there?Well we could get a 1.If we get a 1 on the first die,
we have to get a 1 on thesecond die.If we get a 2 on the first die,
we have to get a 2 on thesecond die.If we get a 3 on the first die,
we have to get a 3 on thesecond die.I think you see where
this is going.4 and 4.5 and 5.And then 6 and 6.So how many of these outcomes
involve us getting double?Well, it's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 outcomes.So there's 6 outcomes
with doubles.So if someone asks
you, what's theprobability of getting doubles?The probability of getting
doubles when you rolled twosix-sided dice, numbered
from 1 to 6.It's going to be equal to the
number of outcomes that giveus doubles-- so it's going to
be equal to 6-- over thenumber of the total number
of possible outcomes.Over 36.And 6 over 36 is 1/6.Now I made sure that you kind of
understood that look, theseare all the possible outcomes.And 6 of them satisfy.So 6 of the 36.So there's a 1/6 probability
of rolling doubles.But another way you could have
thought about it is, you knowwhat, let's just roll
the first die.It's going to have some
number on it, right?The first die is going to
have some number on it.Now in order for me to have
doubles, the second die has tohave that same exact number
on it, right?So I don't care what
the first die is.It could be a 3, it could
be a 4, it could be a 5.I don't know what that is.But after I've rolled that first
die, in order to getdoubles, what the second die
roll is-- they might be almostsimultaneous-- but what the
second die rolls matters.And so whatever number I have
on the first die, there's a1/6 chance that the second die
is going to have that samenumber on it.So that's another way
of reasoning thatyou have a 1/6 chance.The first die does anything it
wants, but there's only a 1 in6 chance that the second die
is going to have the samething as the first die.Either way, you get to
the same 1/6 answer.
