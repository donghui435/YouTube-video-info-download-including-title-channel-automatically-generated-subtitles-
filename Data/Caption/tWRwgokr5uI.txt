okay this video I'll show you guys forthe central angle term is and also showyou guys how to prove itfirst of all we'll start off with sisteralcohol and then I will put down thecenter of the circle to be right hereand I will call this to be all and thenwe'll pick two points on the circle andlet me just pick this and that point Iwill call this to be hung a and Point Cthe central angle is that you justconnect a to the center and the centerto see this right here is the centralangle okay that's the more than one okayit has to be less than 180 degrees so aby definition of course this right hereis the outer piece but not this rightit's that you should want that wereferred it to but anyway now we aregoing to pick another point on thecircle but not on this arc anywhere fromhere to here and for my first picturelet me put down this point right here Iwill call this point to be B and then wejust connect B to a and then B to C okayand we have this angle that we haveright for the central English roomsaying is that this angle at the centerright it has to be twice as big as thisangle right here so for example if todayyou know this right here is 20 degreesthen that means this right here has tobe 2 times 20 40 degrees okay so let mewrite down a statement for you guyscentral angles rooms that measure ofangle a OC based on my labeling thisright here has to be two times themeasure of angle ABC okay so this ispretty much the statement and you mightbe wondering could B be right here but Iwill show you guys later on path let'sfocus on the proof on this picture firstDoudna put B on this okto that's notgood by anyway let's focus on thispicture first okay how can we do thisfirst of all you ought to remember thatthis right here it's the center of thecircle and when you go from the centerto the circle this is the radius that'salso radius so you know they are thesame rightand furthermore we can actually connectB to D Center as well now it's fair a PCthey are all connected to a center thisright here it's also the radius so thatmeans this has to be the same as thatand now by looking at the triangle onthe left this right here triangle aboit's an isosceles triangle and do weknow how big this angle is we don't sowe can just call this to be X and themoment I put this down to be X we knowthis angle will also to be X becauseonce again these two sides are the samethere's two angles will have to be thesame right and now do we know what howbig this anchor is we don't so but thething is that we don't know if thisangle is the same as that would notright so I would just you know pickanother variable I will just call thisto be Y once they say this angle is y Ican also tell you this right here is yas well by the same reason these twosides are the same right so these twoangles are the same as well okay now ifyou look at this angle and we have thistriangle on the left this angle a OBthis right here has to be 180 degreesminus X and X right so that's minus 2 Xlike that and similarly if you look atthis angle here and go be OC this anglehas to be 180 degrees minus y and thenminus y that's minus 2yokay so that's the idea now we are goingto make a connection between angle a orC and this angle right here and you seeangle a BC it's just X plus y kid I'mMac by the way let's find out whatmeasure of angle a OC based on the latebones that we have as we know this righthereso attitudesixteen right in the middle right hereso we must have 360 minus this and gothat we already know and minus thisangle that we also know right so I willhave 360 minus this angle which is 180minus 2x and then I will have minus 180minus 2y like this and the rest is justactually just doing algebra so we'lljust do this this right here is 260 andthere minus 180 and then minus minusbecomes plus and then minus this minus180 and then minus minus becomes plusall the good stuff 360 minus 180 minus180 is zero they all combine e to be 0so that's good we only have 2 X plus 2our left and we can factor out the 2 soI can write this down as 2 times X plusy and now what it's X plus y if you lookback X plus y it exactly angle a b c sowe did it this right here is 2 x measureof angle a b c okay so this is just onecase of the central angle theoremalright so hopefully you like it so farbut this is not done yet because what ifB is at a mod p start place and by PSare I mean like somewhere right here forexample you see the picture is notpretty it's not similar anymore but thestatements actually the same I'll try toproduce the best picture possible Idon't know anyway so let's say this is athis is C I still have this right hereis my angle AOC okay and this time Iwill pick point B to be right herethis is sadly more bizarre huh becauseyou see now if you connect the dots a toB and then C to be like thiswe are still saying this angle will betwice as biggestI go okay if this is ten that will be 20okay huh you know this is bizarrebecause you cannot just do that likeexactly I think if we connect the dotshopefully the dots will work out rightso let's see I was still like to connectpoint B to the center like this andwe're learning new things right first ofall this ring go this time I will justcall this to be X okay and if you noticefrom here to here it's a radius fromhere to here the radius though we knowthese two sides have to be the sameright so these two sides have to be thesame by looking at this triangle hereand go all CB I will just call this tobe Y okay I'll just call this to be Ynow this base angles whyI call this angle to be X already so howbig is this angle it has to be Y minus Xisn't it so I will just label this thisright here is y minus X okay sohopefully the picture is clear so farand now here's the beauty of all thegeometry this right here is the radiusthis right here it's also the radius soyou can look at this triangle a OB s ands also this triangle this right here isy minus X that means this angle herealso has to be Y minus X isn't it goodhuh now let's see what else can we dookay so far that's what we have this isangle AOC right here I want to come outan angle radius I can maybe to 180 minusthis and that let's take a look this isangle x and y how big is this angle wellthis little angle here has to be 180degrees minus X minus y rightand now by vertical angle because thisand that vertical angles they have to bethe same so this angle right here it hasto be 180 minus X minus y okaywhew okay let's see if we can't doanything right here finally let's take alook of how big this angle is right hereand you see this tear is that the stamenthat have right here it's measure of AOCthat's why I always want to come up witha OC first and that's what I did righthere right ALC is based on this and thatand subtracted from 360 this time a OClet me just ready start measure of anglea OC by looking at this triangleeverything allowed to be 180 instead ofthis triangle right for the angles Iwill stop with 180 and a minus thisangle which is y minus X and then thisangle which is minus 180 degrees yeahsometimes I say degrees sometimes Idon'tdoesn't really matter okay so this isthe expression that we have and now wecan just do some algebra which is nicethis right here is 180 degrees - why - -become plus and then this is going to beminus 180 degrees minus minus becomesplus X Y now 180 negative 180 canceleach other out - y plus y also saybye-byefinally this is equal to 8 plus X that'sthe 2x in the end what is X X is exactlyangle ABC because we yes so so this isstill 2 times the measure of angle a b cso good isn't itso and of proof right here hopefully youguys all like this okayyeah and if you guys are new to mychannel please subscribe I like to makemy videos for you guys and as alwaysthat's it[Music]
