another common model of multiplicationthat we use is the use of an array anarray is an arrangement of columns androws that create smaller squares thetotal smaller squares would give us theproduct to our answers an array isconstructed using the two factors in theproblem eight being the number ofcolumns and six being the number of rowsto comprise the array to figure out thetotal number of squares in the earlystages students might simply count byones to figure out the total number ofsmaller squares eventually we would hopethat the students would move into moreefficient strategies of skip countingstudents are very familiar with skipcounting by twos fives and tens and sowe would hope that they would be able todecompose or break apart this array tobe able to use those efficient quickskip counting methods so for thisproblem we have a six here which makesthem which we would be able to use theskip counting by fives very easily if wewere to decompose the array at thispoint this gives us five rows with eightin each row and we're left with onesingle row down here so then to solvethis we would to solve this this toparray we would then count by fives 5 1015 20 25 30 35 40 for the partialproduct of the top and then down belowwe have one row with eight in it whichwe have eight total squares and then wesimply add these two partial productstogether for total of forty-eight whichgives us the total number of squares forour array which is the product to ourproblem and as always we ask that thestudents label their answers so we havethe answer of 48 and we would want themto write 48 cans of soda
