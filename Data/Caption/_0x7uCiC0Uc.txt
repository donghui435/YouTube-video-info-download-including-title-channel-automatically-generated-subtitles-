welcome around the Year 300 BC a fellowby the name of Euclid devised analgorithm that is a method for workingout the greatest common factor of twonumbers for example suppose I wish towork out the greatest common factor of30 and 42 now now I'm writing this is afraction that me in a fraction but hereare two numbersI know 30 and 40 to at least have acontract of one that's true about anypair of numbers they're both even sothey have a common factor of 2 so andask what is the greatest common factorshared by these numbers well you couldsuggest suggested doing the followingtake the true numbers keep the smallerof the two as it is so I'll keep 30 is30 but adjust the larger by subtractingthe smaller number from it so 42 minus30gives me 12 now I've got the numbers 30and 12 let's repeat the algorithm keepthe small of the two in this case now inkeeping 12 but adjust the larger bysubtracting the smaller from it 30 takeaway 12 is now 18 now ask for thegreatest common factor of 12 and 18 wellto do that repeat the same algorithmkeep the smaller the to keep the 12 andadjust the larger by subtracting thesmaller format 18 take away 12 is 6 andwe'll do it one more time keep thesmaller of the two which is now 6 andadjust the larger by subtracting thesmaller from it12 take away 6 is 6 this gives me acommon value I try to go further thisalgorithm I ask myself which is more ofthe true there is no smaller so let'sstop so this seems like a naturalstopping point and in fact you couldsaid we have two common values that acommon value is indeed the greatestcommon factor the original two numbers30 is a multiple of 6 42 is a multiple 6and in fact 6 is the greatest commonfactor of 30 and 42 just approach thetechnique one time more time let's tryto work out the greatest common factorof safety 25 and 10 let's pretend wecouldn't see it was 5you could says keep the smaller andadjust the larger number by subtractingthe smaller from it again keep thesmaller and adjust the larger number bysubtracting the smaller from it and doit one more time because now we have twovalues of the same and the claim is thatis indeed the greatest common factor ofthe two original numberswhich this five is the greatest commonfactor of 25 and 10 I will do one moreexample that's a little extreme howabout something like 13 and 5 I thinkthe grades come affected there is onedoes the algorithm show one where heregoes keep the smaller and adjust thelarger keep the small of the two andadjust the larger by subtracting thesmaller from itget the small of the two now keepingthree and adjusts the larger keep thesmall of the two that's number two thistime and adjust the larger one and onemore time will give me a common valuekeep smaller and adjust the larger ofone yep the algorithm is telling me thegreatest common factor of 13 and 5 isindeed 1 now the important question whydoes this work well it's kind of neatwhat we're really doing is taking twonumbers let's say a and B and it's andsubtracting them from each other nowI'll pretend a is the larger here so I'mmaking them a and a minus B I claim andthis is the key to the algorithm thatany common factor of a and B is also acommon factor of a and a minus B andvice versa let me be specific supposehave the numbers 30 and 42 and I'm goingto adjust them to become 30 and withsubtraction they become 12 now let's seeto be specific what are the commonfactors of 30 and 42 when the both ofthe common factor of 1 they're both evenhave a convective - they're bothmultiples of 3 and they're bothmultiples of 6 now is it true that 30and 12 have the same common factorswell I both the common factor of 1they're both even have a contract of -they're both multiples of 3 and they areboth multiples of 6 and if you thinkabout it for a moment there are no othercommon factors so this process issubtraction it seems doesn't change thecommon factors of the two numbers you'retalking about in fact that makes senseif my original two numbers the samemultiples of 5 then that will remain amultiple 5 nothing's changed to it andthe difference of two multiples of 5 isagain a multiple of 5 if they're bothmultiples of 24 the right hand side willgive me more 24 so the process oftraction does not change factorsand conversely if you like goingbackwards is really a process ofadditionthis guy's a model of six this guy's amodel six I've kept the first one thesame I've added the two multiples of 6to get 42in fact if these two numbers on theright that multiple six addition willpreserve the fact that multiples are sixso again this factor of six is preservedso the process of traction or goingbackwards a slow process of additionwill not change the factors of numbersthat's it so if I do a process like 30over 42 and do this repeated maneuver ofsubtracting the smaller from the largerhere the common factors are one twothree and six again the common factorsare not changing do it one more time thecommon factors won't change do it onemore time the common factors won'tchange to another time until I get acommon value the common factors don'tchange now this is interesting what arethe common factors of 6 & 6 well clearlythe common factors are 6 & 6 are 6 isthe biggest common factor and all itsown factors so the common factors of 6 &6 are obviously 6 and it's and itsfriends which means the common factorsof 30 and 42 are 6 and all its friendsin particular 6 itself is the biggestcommon factor of the original twonumbers so the Euclidean algorithmstates the following works as followsthis let's get this clear start with twonumbers a / b and keep subtracting thesmaller from the larger until you get acommon factor common a common value nowthis process says common factors willnever change so the common factors of aand B are exactly the same as the commonfactors of D and D in particular thebiggest common factor of a and B is thesame as the biggest common factor of Dand D which is clearly D therefore if dis the biggest common factor here D isalso the biggest common factor therethere is one question could I ever dothis process of repeated subtracting andnever get down to a common value in theend well if you think about it of coursethat this process has to stop as I playthis game I'm dealing with pairs ofnumbers they're getting smaller I wishto stay in the realm of positive valuesso I'll never allow myself to get to 0in which case there's no way I can keepsubtracting and keep going on foreverwithout going beyond 0 so if I'm forcedmyself to stop at 0 that means I will bestopping at some point and the only timethat I'm going to stop is when the twovalues are the same when there is nosmaller to subtract from the larger sotherefore the equivalent algorithm mustindeed terminate to give me the greatestcommon factor of the two originalnumbers voila
