okay in this video I'm going to doanother example of solving a quadraticequation by completing the square so inthis case we have the x squared plus 4xminus 7 equals 0 so again the firstthing I'm going to do is add 7 to bothsides so if we add 7 to both sides thatwill give us x squared plus 4x equalspositive 7 and again I'm going to dothis trick well not really a trick it'sjust kind of a clever observation thatmake things to make things work againwhatever numbers in front of the X inthis case it's positive 4 we take 1/2 ofthat number so 1/2 of positive 4 isgoing to give us positive 2 and then wetake that number and square it whichwill give us positive 4 this new numberwe get out that's what we're going toadd to both sides of the equation andagain the left side now is a perfectsquare x squared plus 4x plus 4 is goingto factor as X plus 2 times X plus 2which we can write as X plus 2 squared7 plus 4 is going to give us 11 andagain now at this step we take thesquare root of both sides stick mypositive and negative on the right sideon the left side that simply leaves uswith X plus 2 we've got positive andnegative square root of 11well that's not a nice hole number Ican't really simplify down the squareroot of eleven either so I'm just goingto leave that alone but again now itsays we have two solutions we havewhoops we have X plus two equalspositive square root of eleven that'sgoing to give us one of our solutionsafter we solve it and then we also haveto take X plus two equals negativesquare root of eleven well in the firstone we'll simply subtract two and we'llget x equals the square root of elevenminus two it'll be one of our solutionsagain not a nice whole number but that'sokay and in the second one again we'lljust subtract two from both sides andwe'll get x equals negative square rootof eleven minus two as our othersolution
