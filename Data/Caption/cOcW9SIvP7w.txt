hey this is fresh shell Walker the greenring an annulus is the area between twoconcentric circles the line segment istangent to the inner circle and has alength of eight what is the area of thering in this video I'm going to presentfive different ways to solve thisproblem even if you can get the correctanswer you might want to keep watchingto the end of the video where I give abrief introduction to visual calculuscan you figure it out give this problema try and when you're ready keepwatching the video for the solution wellfirst adjust the diagram in several wayswe'll rotate the figure so the tangentline is horizontal next we'll draw theinner circle radius with the length of Bvertically the radius makes a rightangle because the line is tangent and itbisects the tangent line so half of thetangent line will be a length of fourI'll just draw one of the halves as aequals four finally draw the outercircle radius with the length of C to bethe hypotenuse of the right triangle thefirst way you can solve this problem isto make convenient numbers if theproblem was on a multiple choice testyou can deduce there is a singlenumerical answer that does not depend onthe dimensions of B and C so you canpick convenient values for B and C weneed a right triangle where one life isequal to four we might as well use thethree four five right triangle whichmeans B is equal to 3 and C is equal tofive now we can solve the problem asfollows we can calculate the area of theouter circle is pi times C squared sinceC is equal to five this is equal to 25pi we then can calculate the area of theinner circle this will bepi times b squared since B is equal to 3this equals 9 pi finally the area of thegreen ring is the difference between thearea of the outer circle and the area ofthe inner circle so we subtract thesetwo areas to get the answer of 16 pi ifall you cared about was the correctanswer you could mark this on the examand move on but there's a largerquestion why does the answer not dependon the dimensions of B and C in the nextfew methods I'll present some generalproofs and also give you some idea ofwhy this is true so first let's showthat the answer doesn't depend on thedimensions of the circles it onlydepends on the length a of the tangentsegment we can proceed similarly butwe're going to use the Pythagoreantheorem in a right triangle a squaredplus B squared is equal to C squaredwhich means a squared is equal to Csquared minus B squared now just like inthe previous method we calculate thearea of the outer circle this will be pitimes C squared we then calculate thearea of the inner circle this is pitimes b squared the area of the greenring will be the difference between thearea of the outer circle and the area ofthe inner circle so this will be pitimes c squared minus pi times b squaredand we know that C squared minus Bsquared is equal to a squared by thePythagorean theorem therefore the answeronly depends on the quantity a so when ais equal to 4 the answer again is 16 pibut we've proven this generally for anylength so it always will be pi times asquared there's a Miller special casethat allow you to solve this problem isto take a limiting case we'll let theinner circle radius be equal to 0 so ifwe shrink the inner circle the tangentchord will become the radius of theouter circle to show you what I mean bythisI created a demonstration on the websiteDesmondcalm it's a graphing calculator and acalculator and you could check it out Iprovided a link in the video descriptionso I created a graphical version of thisproblem I created some equations ofcircles I shaded in the green ring andwe have a tangent chord whose dimensionI set to be equal to a equals four ashalf of the tangent length the radius ofthe inner circle I started out with thevalue of 3I then calculated the area in betweenthe two circles using calculus and usingthe formula pi times a squared you'llsee they're equal to each othernow you can adjust these variables anddecimals so let's imagine shrinking theinner circle radius well obviously theouter circle radius will have to adjustdynamically and you can see that itkeeps shrinking as well when the innercircle radius goes all the way down tozero we get that the outer circle radiusis equal to 4 and that's exactly equalto the tangent chord length of a equals4 so you can see that the tangent curvebecomes the radius of the outer circleand so we can calculate the area you cansee that the area in these two formulasdoesn't change as you change the radiusof the inner circle it's only dependenton that length a equals 4 so what thismeans is we calculated that the area ofthe annulus is equal to pi times asquared which equals 16 pi and that'sapproximately 50 point 265 as shown inthe decimals interactive now just tofollow up this decimals interactive youcan also play around with the length ofthe tangent chord so you can see that ifthe tangent chord increases you'reactually are going to change the area inbetween the two circles and if thetangent gourd decreases it's also goingto change it and you can see the twomethods of calculation give exactly thesame numerical answer now for anyparticular value of the tangent chordyou're going to see that the area of thegreen ring is unchanged it only dependson the look that value of the parametera so it's an interesting interactive andyou can check it out and it'll give youa deeper understanding for what's goingonso now another way we can solve thisproblem let's return to our diagram wecan use textbook geometry in theintersecting chord theorem so let'screate some chords of the outer circlewe'll extend the horizontal line to be achord of the outer circle and we'llextend the vertical line to be a chordof the outer circle so we'll extend thevertical line this will be a radius ofthe outer circle and here will be thedifference between the radius of theouter circle and the inner circle whichwill be C minus B so now let me removesome of the things that we don't need wejust have the outer circle and we havetwo cores of this outer circleintersecting the second segment of thevertical chord is equal to C plus B sothe two chords of the outer circleintersect dividing each chord into twosegments the product of the two segmentsof one chord equals the product for theother chord of their two segments so thehorizontal chord is divided into twosegments four and four and the verticalchord is divided into two segments Cplus B and C minus B we multiply thesegments of each chord and set themequal to each other this simplifies tobe 16 is equal to C squared minus Bsquared that's the information we needand we now return to our originaldiagram we know the area of the Ring isequal to the area the outer circle minusthe area of the inner circle and thiswill be pi times the quantity C squaredminus B squaredwell we calculated C squared minus Bsquared is equal to 16 therefore we getthe area of the ring is equal to 16 piso this is just one more way that youcould solve this problem that doesn'trequire the Pythagorean theorem and youcan actually just get this based on theintersecting core theorem so now let meshow you one more way you could solvethis problem it's using a method knownas visual calculus or many cons theoremin 1959 Caltech student Mimi Kahn NASAkenyon devised a new approach to solvethe area of an annuals which led to anew proof of the Pythagorean theoremimagine rotating the triangle andconsiderthe area the tangent line sweeps out inparticular look at the area that side asweeps out it exactly sweeps out thearea of the annulus now we can considera discrete version of this processconsider the area the tangent linesweeps in 10 degree intervals these arethe shapes of the area swept out inapproximately 10 degrees and these arejust approximate shapes to give you anidea of what's going on is a sweepsaround and rotates so one way we cancalculus area is we're going to groupall of these tangents sweeps and we'regoing to rearrange them so they have acommon center point so we separate allof these tangent sweeps and now we'regoing to rearrange these so they're at acommon center point and we end up with anew shape this has exactly the same areaas before but what is the shapewell it should be reminiscent of afamiliar geometrical shape this will besomething which has a length a radius ofa and it's going to be a circle with theradius of a now technically the circleis the limiting shape for the tangentcluster when the tangents waves aretaking in infinitesimally small degreeintervals but even in these ten degreeintervals you could get an idea thatthese tangent cluster would be a circlewith a radius exactly equal to the sidelength a so the tangent sweep has thesame area as the tangent cluster becauseall you're doing is rearranging thechanges sweeps into a new shape so youcould imagine a special case or insteadof sweeping out over the annulus youactually have that length a sweepingaround a center point so what shapewould that make well that would make ashape of the circle exactly therefore wecan calculate the areas of the tangentsweep of a of the annulus instead oftrying to calculate that we couldcalculate it in terms of this tangentcluster well we know the area of acircle is equal to PI timeswe're therefore that's also the area ofthe annulus this sort of thought processcan be generalized and formalized intomannequin theorem the area of a tangentsweep is equal to the area of thistangent cluster regardless of the shapeof the original curve the tangent linesweeps furthermore what we've just doneis we've come up with a new proof forthe Pythagorean theorem just imaginethat in 1959 someone comes up with a newproof for a result that was known forthousands of years so why does thisresult in the Pythagorean theorem wellwe calculated the area the annulus isequal to pi times a squared but we alsoknow the area the annulus is adifference in the areas of the circlewhich will be pi times the quantity Csquared minus B squared so we can setthese two formulas for the area theannual is equal to each other we thencancel out the pi and rearrange to getthat C squared is exactly equals asquared plus B squared so we have a newproof of a thousands of year old theoremso that's the answer this problem didyou figure it out and which way
