Hello. I'm Professor Von Schmohawk
and welcome to Why U.In the last several lectures
we explored the concept of a "binary relation".We saw that the set of ordered pairs
which forms a binary relationis sometimes referred to
as the "graph" of the relation.So in a binary relation on R, the graph would
be a set of ordered pairs of real numbers.Since Cartesian coordinates can be used to
visually represent ordered pairs of real numbersthis is a way to visually represent
the graph of a relation on R.Graphing a set of ordered pairs can be usefulwhen trying to understand
how two quantities may be related.For example, could there be some correlation
between the height and weightof members of the
U.S. Men's National Soccer Team?Let's start by making a table
with the height and weight of each player.We can then create
a collection of ordered pairswhere the first element of an ordered pair
is the player's heightand the second element is his weight.This collection of ordered pairs
forms a binary relation.The domain of this relation
is the set of all height valuesand the range is the set of all weights.Notice that several players
have a height of 72 inchesor a weight of 170 pounds.But these values are listed only once
in the domain and range.This is because the domain and range are sets
and every member of a set must be unique.No member of a set
may be listed more than once.Now let's graph this relation
using Cartesian coordinates.For each ordered pairwe will plot the position of the first coordinate
on the horizontal axisand the second coordinate
on the vertical axis.Since height and weight
can only have positive valueswe can eliminate everything
except the first quadrant of the graph.We will mark the horizontal axis
in increments from zero to 80 inchesand the vertical axis
in increments from zero to 300 pounds.Now starting with the first ordered pairwe locate the value of the first coordinate
on the horizontal axisand the second coordinate
on the vertical axis.So the point corresponding to the
height and weight of the first soccer playeris located at this
horizontal and vertical position.Likewise, the ordered pair
corresponding to the second playeris represented by a point
at a horizontal position of 76 inchesand a vertical position of 210 pounds.Each of the remaining ordered pairs
is plotted in the same way.Notice that these points are very close togetherand take up only
a very small portion of our graph.However, we can rescale the graph so that
the points are spread over a larger areaand easier to see.When graphing only positive values
it is not necessary to start the axes at zero.For example, we could make the first division
on the horizontal axis 60 inchesand the first division on the vertical axis
100 pounds.Graphs of finite sets of ordered pairs
are called "scatter plots".Scatter plots allow us
to visually detect patternswhich may exist
in a relation between two quantities.For example, in this scatter plot
it is apparent that as a general trendthe weight of a player increases
as the height increases.We summarize this correlation
between the two quantitiesby drawing what is called a "trend line".This example illustrates what in mathematics
is called a "positive correlation".since on the average, as a player's height
increases, so does his weight.But, if as height increased weight decreasedheight and weight would be "negatively correlated".Or, if no trend between height and weight
was apparentwe would say they were "uncorrelated".When the data points are grouped
closely to the trend linewe say that they are "strongly correlated".If the data points are grouped
more loosely around the trend line
0:04:55.500,0:04:49.600
we say that they are "weakly correlated".A trend line is sometimes called
a "line of best fit"and there are various ways to draw this line.In general, a trend line is drawn in a waythat minimizes the distance
between the line and the data points.One way to draw a trend lineis to simply estimate the position
which seems to fit the data points the best.This is similar to trying to build
a straight roadthat comes as close as possible
to several different towns.The optimum path might be the one
which minimizes the sum of the distancesbetween the road and the towns.Many spreadsheet programs and scientific calculatorshave functions that mathematically
calculate trend lineswhich minimize the vertical distance
to the data points.One of the most common methods
is the "least squares" methodwhich minimizes the sum of the squares
of the vertical distances.Scatter plots can be useful for comparing
characteristics of different groups.For instance, if we graph
the weight versus heightfor the U.S. Men's National Soccer Team
in blueand the weight and height
for a random sample of men in redwe would see that the weights and heights
of the soccer teamwere much more tightly grouped
than the random sample.One reason could be
that the U.S National Soccer Team playersare in better shape than the average person.One important type of binary relation
which we will often encounter in mathematicsis a special type of relation called a "function".In the next lecture
we will see how to create functionswhich will allow us to visualize and analyze
many types of interesting and useful relationships.
