in this example we're asked to find thevolume of the given cylinder to find thevolume of a cylinder we use the sameformula that we use to find the volumeof a prism volume equals area of thebase times height notice however thatthe base of a cylinder is a circle andremember that the formula for the areaof a circle is pi times radius squaredso the formula for the volume of acylinder can be written as pi timesradius squared times height so to findthe volume of the given cylinder sincethe radius is seven meters and theheight is 10 meters we can plug thisinformation into the formula to get pitimes 7 meters squared times 10 metersremember that 7 meters squared is thesame thing as 7 meters times 7 meterswhich equals 49 meters squared and wehave pi times 49 meters squared times 10meters which simplifies to 490 pi meterscubed so one way to write the volume ofthe given cylinder is 490 PI cubicmeters next remember that pi isapproximately equal to 3.14 so we canplug 3.14 and for pi and we have 490times 3.14 meters cubed which equals onethousand five hundred thirty-eight pointsix meters cubed so another way to writethe volume of the given cylinder is 1538point six cubic meters
