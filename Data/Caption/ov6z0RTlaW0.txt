let's try answering a few questionsbased on lines and angles in this figurelines P and Q intersect and form fourangles in the center a b c and d here'sthe first question the measure of anglea is given as 75 degrees we have beenasked to find the measure of angle Dpause the video and try it out simple asP is a straight line angles a and D forma linear pair their sum will be 180degrees so if a is 75 then D willmeasure 105 degrees that was easynow look at the second one we have beenasked to find B plus C minus D try itout if you calculated each and performthe operations you have wasted a lot ofprecious timedon't forget time is of utmostimportance the measure of angles B and Dare equal as they are verticallyopposite angles so B and D would simplycancel out here what they're asking usis simply the value of C and as a and Care vertically opposite angles C willalso measure 75 degrees here's the lastquestion ignore the first two answerswhile answering this one we are giventhe value of B plus D we have been askedto find the measure of angle a as B andD are equal and as their sum is 210degrees each of them will measureexactly half of 210 degrees which is 105degrees and as awe form a linear pair a will measure 75degrees their sum is 180 degrees yes thequestions based on lines and angles arefairly simple provided you arecomfortable with the basics let's tryone based on three intersecting linesthree lines P Q and R intersect at onepoint and form six angles a b c d e andf the first question asks us to find thesum of all angles in this figure as P isa straight line angles a B and Ctogether would equal 180 degrees so aplus B plus C will equal 180 degrees andfor the same reason D plus E Plus F willalso equal 180 degrees that's it the sumof these two will give us the sum of allsix angles the total will be 180 plus180 which equals 360 degrees no matterhow many lines intersect at a point thesum of all angles formed at that pointwill always be 360 degrees next we havebeen given the sum of a and D as 80degrees and we have been asked to findthe sum of angles B and C as a and D arevertically opposite angles theirmeasures will be equal so both willmeasure 40 degrees each we know that Qis a straight line so the sum of anglesb c and d will equal 180 degrees we knowthe value of D it's 40 degrees so B plusC will equal 140 degrees one lastquestionfind the average of angles BC andsee ignore the first two solutions whenyou're looking at this one the averageof BC and D would be the sum of themeasures of these three angles dividedby three and that makes us think that weneed the measures of each of the anglesthat's incorrect we know that Q is astraight line so B plus C plus D willequal 180 degrees there you go we havethe sum directly the average will equal180 divided by three which is 60 degreesthat's the average of the three angles BC and D
