hi my name is Maria I'm a mathematicianand today I'm going to show you how tosolve linear equations with variables onboth sides so if I have an equation like3x minus 7 is equal to 5x plus 4 thefirst thing you want to do is get yourvariable on one side so I have a 3x andI have a 5x and the easiest thing to doto avoid negatives when possible is toget rid of the smaller coefficient so Ihave a 3 and a 5 I'm going to get rid ofthe 3 so because it's 3x positive theway that I would get rid of it accordingto inverse operations is by subtractingit so I would subtract 3x because when Ido that 3 X minus 3 X will cancel itselfoutso if I subtract 3x from this side ofthe equation I have to subtract 3x fromthis side of equation and I know that Ican only subtract like terms so I'mgoing to subtract it from the 5x so whenI do that 3x minus 3x cancel out and I'mleft with negative 7 it's reallyimportant to always remember to bringdown the sign that comes before thenumber I call it the leash bring downyour equal sign 5x minus 3x is equal to2x and bring down my plus 4 now that thevariables on one side I just follow thesame steps that I followed solve anyequation which is to use inverseoperations and always remember to getrid of addition or subtraction firstsomeone's going to do minus 4 on bothsides and when I do that I get negative7 minus 4 is negative 11 equals 2x 4minus 4 cancels itself out last step I'mgoing to divide by 2 on both sides andI'm going to get x equals negative 11halves or if I go I don't want to changethat to a mixed number would be negative5 and 1/2 my name is Maria and I justshowed you how to solve linear equationswith variables on both sides
