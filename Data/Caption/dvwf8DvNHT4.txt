So you might have been wondering, "How do
I use the different quotient with fractions?"Well, the simple answer is, the same way you'd
use it with any other type of function.But there is one small trick I'll show you
that'll make finding the difference quotientfor a rational function a whole lot easier.So now we know that this is the formula for
the difference quotient.With any difference quotient problem, we really
only need two pieces: f of x plus h, and fof x.This second term, f of x, is just the function
itself that we're given.This first term, f of x plus h, is whatever
we get when we replace x with x plus h inour original function.And regardless of the type of function we
start with, whether it's a fraction or not,we're still just looking for f of x plus h
and f of x.But let's do an example where we find the
difference quotient for a fraction, like thefunction 3 over x minus 2.Starting with the difference quotient formula,
we can replace f of x with 3 over x minus2, since f of x is always just the original
function that we've been given.Now all we need is f of x plus h.So we'll replace x with x plus h everywhere
in our original function, and we'll get fof x plus h is equal to 3 over x plus h minus
2.Now we can plug this into the difference quotient
formula for f of x plus h.Up to this point, this is exactly what we'd
do for any kind of function, regardless ofwhether or not the function is a fraction.But here's where the trick comes in.Once you get to this point, you need to start
simplifying the difference quotient, but you'vegot what we'll call the "little fractions"
inside the "bigger fraction".It can be confusing to simplify fractions
within fractions, but here's the trick todo it one easy step.You want to find a common denominator for
the little fractions.So the denominator of the first little fraction
is x plus h minus 2, and the denominator ofthis second little fraction is x minus 2.The easiest way to find a common denominator
is just to multiply these together.Don't feel like you need to multiply this
out; the vast majority of the time it reallywon't help you at all.Once you have this common denominator, you'll
want to multiply both the numerator and denominatorof the big fraction by that value.You can do that, of course, because when the
numerator and denominator are equal, the fractionis equal to 1, so we're really just multiplying
by 1, which of course doesn't change the value.So now we just need to do some distribution.When we multiply the common denominator by
3 over x plus h minus 2, it'll cancel outthe x plus h minus 2, leaving us with just
3 times x minus 2.When we multiply the common denominator by
the 3 over x minus 2, it'll cancel out thex minus 2, leaving us with just 3 times x
plus h minus 2.And in the denominator we get h multiplied
by the common denominator.And just like that, you've eliminated the
little fractions in one easy step.Now we can simplify the numerator by multiplying
everything out, and then canceling terms.Finally, we'll cancel out the h from the numerator
and denominator.That'll be our final answer, and that's how
you use the difference quotient with fractions.Could you use some extra help with math?Click the button to head over to CalculusExpert.com.It's where I've collected and organized all
