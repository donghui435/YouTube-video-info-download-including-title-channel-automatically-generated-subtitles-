welcome here's a little tidbit fromgeometry and we present you with achallenge I'll give you on a piece ofpaper a picture of a circle and ask youto find with find the center that circlefor me and the only tools they'll allowyour pencil so you can mark things anddraw things and a piece of paper anotherpiece of paper how would you do it welllet me read the answer but the realchallenge is actually explaining why theanswer works he goes I claimed the firstthing you do is just lay your piece ofpaper across the circle in some waywhoops my paper disappeared so that thecall of the paper the no degree anglelies at one point of the circle theother two edges intersect the circle attwo positions which I claim mark offereda maddening you should use the side ofthe paper then to actually draw thatline if you wish now that's really trueif that dotted red line reads thatammeter then we just repeat the tricklay the piece of paper at a differentposition across the circle see maybelike this still adore and then mark of asecond diameter and while I wear thosetwo dominas intersect that must be thetrue center of the circle okay so theseare obviously rely on classical is alsomy geometry course what's reallyventures here is to prove that markingoff an eye degree angle really doesacross bond to the dammit of the circlenow there's really two ways to do itmost people will actually get theconverse going first which is actuallynot relevant to the problem it's calledtalese theorem it's actually the oldestrecorded result in in all of geometry heclaimed that if you could I'd ammeterfirst then the angle subtended themedallion and it is 90 degrees greatthat's correct and bet that if you wantno quick way to prove it if you actuallyhave a situation like this draw threeradii this C X this must be X to Y thisMassoud why 180 degrees in a triangleyou can chase this through and provethat X plus y must be 90 but that'sirrelevant that's starting off with thediameter and proven got 90 degrees whatwe're doing is telling with 90 degreesand need to prove that we have adiameter so how do we prove that he goeswhen I present this result to mystudents I actually do it as anothertactile puzzleI draw on the board two dots imaginetheir nails or something on the board totax and I give the students a piece ofpaper yet again which has a built inlife degree angle and I ask thefollowing take that piece of paper andshove it somewhere up between those twoto tax and muck with the corner paper isand then do the same thing take thepiece of paper and shove it up there Ido it politely of course and a differentangle and repeat this take this piece ofpaper this 90-degree angle and positionit between the two decks at variousdifferent positions then you'll see thatthere's call is that piece of paper seemto mark out a curve and if you lookclosely most people want to say rightoff the bat that curve is actually acircle while my question is is it reallycircle how do we know that's a circleand that's the issue at hand that isgiven the night degree angle first howdo we know that is correspond to thecircle what most people would say if itis a circle or they're going to guess atthe center of the circle is the midpointbetween those two texts that's radius Rthat also be ready sir so the challengeto prove that this dotted blue linereally is a circle to say any point onthis is this shape has the property thatits distance to the midpoint is also ourthat's what we need to prove if weimprove that any point on this dottedcurve is equidistant from the two tax afrom the midpoint is just the midpointis from the two tax then we must have acircle how do we prove that let me justdraw clean a picture for starters sowe're given two fixed points deliverradius R radius R we've given some curvehere and we're asking if I draw thispoint here at 90 degrees is thisdistance also are the red dotted linewell the trick is to take this pictureof a right triangle and rotate it aboutthat midpoint 90 degrees and makeanother copy of it down here now I claimthis red shape really is a rectangle andit follows if this is angle X here therotated triangle has an angle matchingangle x over yonder and this is angledot this is also angled odd but hundredeighty degrees in a triangle if I lookat the original triangle 90 plus X plusdots 180 that tells me x plus dollars 90that is X plus daughter's 90 x plusdollars 90 I have a rectangle what weknow about rightthe diagonals of rectangles arecongruent and bisect each other I guesswe would have proved that in a previousshow episode so that's R and R thatmeans the other diagonals the samelength and it's also bisectors it mustalso be R and R which case yes thispoint up here is indeed equidistant fromthe midpoint in fact all these points onthe circle think we do some of themidpoint that is what I said the wrongthing all points on this curve equidisn't on this midpoint that curvetherefore must be circle voila so ifyou're given a flower pot outside I handyou a piece of paper you know how tofind the center of that flower pot justtake your piece of paper lay it acrossthe night degrees touch the corners andnow your mark of a diameter the flowerpoint and off you go um archaeologistssometimes run into this sort of problemand I'll leave this as a challenge foryou suppose you come across in yourdiggings the segment of a flower potthat is all you get is a broken rim ofsomething circular that's it you got anarc of a circle what the full circlejust an arc maybe it's the arc of awheel and it was a curve of a jar orsomething the question is using the verysimple simple tools could you nowcompute the radius of the circle fromwhich that art came you might want apiece of paper you might want to pencilin my own a piece of chalk I might evengive you a rule this time so youactually measure things how would youwork at the radius of circle from whichan ark came that's all we've got is thatmark could you find this locate thecenter of the circle good challengethanks very muchyou
