to construct an equilateral triangle westart with a base or a side and we makea segment with endpoint a and end pointB now because we know an equilateraltriangle has three equal sides we useour compass to measure the length ofsegment a B by putting the compass pointon a and the pencil point on B then wecan use that same setting to draw an arcup above our original segment we'regoing to take the compass over to pointB and draw an arc to intersect that arcnow we label that point of intersectionC then we draw segment AC and segment BCand we have an equilateral triangle
