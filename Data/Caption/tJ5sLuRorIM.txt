welcome in this video let's talk aboutone of the most beautiful formulas ofall time in all of mathematics in factEuler's formula e to the i-x perrolliequals cosine of X plus I sine of X thishas been in voted on as the mostbeautiful formula in mathematics andvarious newspaper polls and so forthit's kind of fun but it's a usuallydiscussed in second semester calculus atcollege levels or in BC calculus at thehigh school level once one knows Taylorseries we know the Taylor series ofcosine of X and sine of X and the Taylorseries of Eire the X you put thesepieces together if you're willing to getwork with a number I and I get thisfamous result would like to present hereis another wave has even a swift way ofgetting this formula if you're willingto believe that complex numbers behavethe way you do they do so here goes umit's astounding that this formula existsin the first place I think oilerpre-filters chair when you realize thisbecause it unites trigonometry which isreally quite a complicated theory andmakes all of it just a theory of powersif you willing to work with complexnumbers in fact all the trig identitiesone plays with just horrible I don'thave them in my head what I do in myhead instead is I work with e to the i-xinstead and then quickly use thisformula translate into trigonometryresults lovely formula fabulous formulalet's get going on it so I'm going toassume that we know some basic carebecause let me know how to take thederivative basic functions impact I'llbe very clear I'm going to assume thatwe know what the derivative cosine of Xis and that turns out to be negativesine of X and the derivative sine of Xis cosine of X and also like to mentionthat the derivative of e to the X infact this is the whole definition of eis why e is the right number to use incalculus that makes it easy and there'sa little pun there but I actually meanit the root of e to the X is for thesimplest thing it could be apart frombeing a constant namely its itself so Eis the natural base to use in calculusin fact I'll do a little video to talkabout this some more and ye what E isand why it's the natural number to usein this theory in any case there's Ijust need a slight variation of this onethe derivative of actually e to say the2x is really composition functions on achain rule the derivative e to the Xpart essentially times the drew theinsideit drew me to the x/2 does that this etimes 2 to the XS that functions almostthe derivative of itself and thederivative in general of e to the K Xwould be K e to the K X all right hegoes if you've done enough firstsemester calculus to get that far you'reset to derive Euler's formula let meshow you how sometimes I'm just clear myboard here suppose I'm looking for afunction y with the following propertywhere's my pen here goes out thederivative of Y to basically be itselflet's say K Y and whatever the propertyjust get things started it when I put inx equals zero it actually equals 1 wellof course we can think of a functionlike this I've just been doing one longy equals e to the K X we'll do aderivative Y the KX will be K times e tothe K X K times itself there we are andput in x equals zero that pops onebeautiful now that choose a very cleverchoice for K since I'm going to beplayful I can choose any value for Klike I like to choose I as my value of Kso they look for a function with theproperty that the derivative of itselfit is is I times itself sort my weddingsthe lock there and still I'd like tohave initial value of one can I think ofa function that fits that formula wellyes if I look at the left part here I'vejust been doing it all along I'll do itand again clearly the formula as my pencolor y equals e to the i-x fits thebillthe derivative itself would just be Iwill come down I times e to the i-x andy of 0 again is 1 so we're set to butboth pieces filling but if I think aboutit is actually another function thatfits well find out why the cosine of Xplus I sine of X its derivative of thisbeast is negative sine of x plus Icosine of X in fact from sneaky negative1 is really I squared that's I squaredsine of X plus Ison of X let me pull out a common factorI this is really Kirsten I'veaccidentally switched the order hereplus I sine of X which is I times itselflook at that it's derivative is I timesitself so I've got this first pops Attisfide does also satisfies the second partdoes Y of 0 equal 1 let's check Y of 0is cosine of 0 plus I sine of 0 cosineof 0 is 1 plus I times sine of 0 0 it'sone its checks then the theorydifferential equations if I give you afirst-order equation of this sort andgive you an initial boundary conditionthe theory says that these are these andsolutions are unique one has to questionwhether it's still true for complexnumbers but I feel pretty compelledright now to say I've got two solutionsto the same equation well I I'm verytempted now to conclude that these twosolutions must be the same so all I'mnow forced to say is that easy are Xmust be the same answer is cosine X plusI sine of X so it's are the same firstorder differential equation and is thesame initial start boom done there wearethis oil is formula done in a prettycompelling way that gets first-yearcalculus students first semester caracalstudents will be getting a high schoolstudents up up and running with this thereason I'm suggesting we put this herebecause I've encountered so many teachto the port in that precalculuscurriculum which i think is horrificthis formula and make kids practice withit so I would suggest you're going to dothis in your precalculus class emailswere to start calculus do somederivatives and derive this formula bythis method and then you've gotjustification why this formula isactually valid in a precursor class kindof wacky really I'd actually reorganizethe whole curriculum entirely but that'sjust me and yeah there we have itthanks very much
