hello Fredwelcome to the session on time speed anddistance this topic forms a key part ofvarious quantitative aptitude ormathematical aptitude sections incompetitive exams and it requires alogical bent of mind to be able to solvethese questions we will discuss thevarious items in theory variousimportant concepts formally and we willtake up some leading examples andquestions to make the key conceptstotally clear so let us get started withour study of time speed and distancetime speed distance as I said a veryvery interesting topic let us assumethat a car is moving from Delhi toBombay Delhi is a fixed point and Bombayis a fixed point and this is a movingobject that is traversing the distancefrom Delhi to Bombay three quantitiesarise the time that this car will taketo cover the distance from Delhi toBombay that distance itself and thespeed with which this object was movingso let me draw a simple diagram toexplain the relation between these threequantities so here is Delhi and here isMumbaiwe have a car that is traveling thisdistance along this direction now let ussay that the distance from Delhi toMumbai is D this is the distance D andlet us say that the body is moving thatis a car here is our car seems to be avery modern car let me put a red lighton top of it a flashing red light ismoving at the speed of s and let us saythat it takes a total time T to coverthe entire distance now we know thatspeed of the object is always equal todistance upon time so let me elaboratethis formula to make it crystal clearspeed of the body or the object is equalto distance covered by the object upontime taken to cover the distance so aswe know we have written this as s isequal to D upon T the fundamentalassumption in this discussion so far isthat the speed of the object wasconstant it was moving at a fixed speedhowever this will not be so always theobject may cover different distanceswith different speeds in which case wewill say that the object has had avariable speed pattern anyway we willcome to that later as of now let usassume that the speed was constant oncewe have this formula speed is equal todistance upon time s is equal to D uponT with us three very interestingrelationships arise so we have theprimary formula with us and now we willlook at three important relationshipsthese are logical relationships and somequestions can be solved directly usingthese relationships so let us get intothat the basic formula we have with usis speed is equal to distance upon timeokay now I have already told you thatthis speed here s was fixed it was notvariable over this distance T for whichit took a time of T so now let us seethe three derivationokay so here are our three derivedrelations first if speed is distanceupon time so this means that if distancecovered is constant then speed variesinversely as the time now when distancecovered is called constant then speedvaries inversely as the time means thatsuppose Delhi to Bombay is being coveredby three different objects this distanceobject a object B object C naturallythe distance is fixed so whicheverobject whichever car will have a higherspeed will take lesser time hence for afixed distance speed varies inversely asthe time I hope this is very clear sothis is our first relationship for fixeddistance speed varies inversely as timea very very important logical relationwhich can be used to solve questionsrelation number two from the sameformula we get time is equal to distanceupon speed so this means that if timetaken is constant then distance variesdirectly as the speed now let us saythat the car was traveling from Delhi toMumbai and then onwards from Mumbai toBangalore and if we say that the timetaken by that car to cover the distancefrom Delhi to Bombay was the same as thetime taken by that car to cover thedistance from Mumbai to Bangalore thenthe distance covered will be directlyproportional to the speed I hope this isvery clear so any object in fixedintervals of time will cover a distancewhich directly varies as its speed Ihope this is very clear and the thirdexample distance is speed into time allthese are derived from the same basicformula so that means that if speed ofthe objectconstant then distance varies distancetraveled varies directly as the time notthis is also very very obvious if thatcar under question is moving at a fixedspeed then it is very obvious that thedistances that it can cover will vary itdirectly as the time that it is going totake so my dear student we now havethree relations with us using the basicformula speed is equal to distance upontime take your time to understand thesethree logically because we will use themlater to solve any questionswe discussed earlier the differencebetween uniform speed and variable speedlet us again understand that at agreater length uniform speed if anobject covers equal distances in thesame time intervals then we say that theobject has a uniform speed however smallthose distances may be and however smallthe time intervals may be whereas ifthis is not so then we say that theobject has a variable speed thus if anyobject or a car for example or an ant ora space shuttle covers the samedistances in different time intervalsthen it is said to have variable speednow let us turn our attention to theunits of measurements and the conversionbetween the various units of measurementfor time speed and distancetime can be measured in secondsminutes per ARS seconds is denoted by sminutes by mi n and ours by H R or Hthis sense can be measured in meters Mkilometers km or miles a naturally speedwill be meters per second MPs orkilometers per hour kmph or miles perour mph so these are the units ofmeasurement one has to be extremelycareful while solving questionsregarding the units of measurement nowlet us focus on the conversion of theseunits another very important aspectwhile trying to solve the questionright so we just saw that time can bemeasured in seconds minutes and ourssimilarly we saw the distance can bemeasured in meters kilometers miles andso naturally speed can be measured inmeters per second mb/s kilometers perhour kmph or miles per hour mph let uslook at length on the conversion ofunits 1 R is equal to 60 minutes isequal to 60 into 60 seconds is equal to3600 seconds 1 kilometers is equal to1,000 meters is equal to 0.62 1 formiles but 1 mile is equal to 1 point sixzero nine kilometers so that brings usto a very interesting relation that 8kilometers is equal to 5 miles you haveto remember all this one yard is 3 feetand one feet is 12 inches 1 km/h isequal to 5 by 18 meters per second veryvery important to be memorized now howdo we get it very simple one kilometerper R is equal to 5 by 18 meters persecond can be derived by putting 1,000meters here in the numerator and 60 into60 seconds in the denominator when yousolve it you get 5 by 18 meters persecond so that means to convertkilometers to our just multiply it by 5by 18 and you get meters per second andto convert meter per second intokilometers per hour just multiply agiven value by 18 by 5 and meter persecond will get converted to kmphsimilarly 1 km/h 1 kilo meter per R willbe equal to 5 by 8 miles per hour sothis means to convert kilometer per R 2miles per hour multiplied by 5 by 8 andto convert miles per R 2 kilometers perhour multiplied by 8 by 5 I hope theseconversionsthese units are absolutely clear to usonce this basic learning is through westarted with the definition of speeddistance upon time we saw the threebasic relations when distance time andspeed respectively will be constant andthen we saw uniform and variable speedsand then the various units and theirconversion so now it is time for us toget into concepts and questions animportant concept if a man changes inspeed in the ratio M is to n then theratio of times taken to cover thatdistance becomes n is 2 m we know thisfrom the original learning when distanceis fixed we know that speed variesinversely as the time taken hence if aman changes his speed in the ratios M is2n in order to cover the same distance Dthen the ratio of time taken will changeto n is 2 Mlet us see a question based on thisbasic concept so here is a questionbased on the simple concept let me readit out walking at 5/6 of his usual ratea boy reaches his school 12 minutes latefind the usual time to reach the schoollet us solve this question speed of theboy is 5/6 of his usual speed so usingthe concept that we have just a deed weknow that time taken by the boy will be6 by 5 off the usual time taken whichbasically means 6 by 5 of the usual timewhich means 5 by 5 of the usual timewhich means 1 D plus 1 by 5 of the usualtime so actually 1 by 5 of the usualtime is the extra time that we aretaking now because our speed has gonedown by 1/6 5 by 6 is our speed and thathas resulted in this 1 by 5 of extratime that we are now taking to reach theschool so this means that reaching 12minutes late is covered by 1 by 5 T thisis the extra time we are taking that'swhy we are late and that late amount oflate is 12 minutes so this means thatunder normal circumstances the time Iwould have taken would be 20 to 5 whichis 60 minutes thus when he goes at hisusual speed he takes 60 minutes to reachthe school hence solve if you practicethis properly you can solve thisquestiondeli speed has become 5/6 so time willbecome 6 by 5 6 by 5 is 5 by 5 plus 1 by5 1 by 5 is 12 so 1 will be 12 into 560thats the answer can be solved mentallyin 10 seconds with some practice let ussee one more question on the sameconcept here is the second questionwalking late 13 by 11th of her usualrate a girl takes 3 minutes less toreach her school find the usual timetaken by the girl to reach the schoollet us solve this againin fact since we have already solved aquestion on this concept can you solvethis question mentally look at thescreen if she is going at 13 by 11th ofher usual speed it means the time takenwill be 11 upon 13th of the usual timethat means 2 by 13th of the usual timeless that means 2 by 13 will be 3 sothat means twice the time will be 39 sothat means the regular time will be 39by 2 which is nineteen point fiveminutes we have just solved it in lessthan 15 seconds let us write and solvethe speed is 13 by 11 of the usual speedso this means that the time this girl isgoing to take she the very sincere girlshe is walking faster than usual itseems is an important class today orsome exam so the time she is going totake will be 11 upon 13th of the usualtime so this means 11 upon 13 of theusual time will be usual time minus 2 by13th of the usual time 13 by 13 is 1that is T so again we reach the samelogicthat this increase of speed to 13 by 11has led to a saving of time of 2 by 13 Tjust like the previous example so 2 by13 of the usual time taken was 3 becausethat's how early she reached which cannow be easily solved so T is equal to 3into 13 divided by 2 which will be 39 by2 which is nineteen point five minutesso this means that she reached normallyin nineteen point five minutes so whatwas the concept we have seen we saw thisbasic concept here if a man changes thespeed in the ratio M is 2 n then thetime taken change in the ratio n is 2 mand then we saw these two questionsquestion 1 and question 2 based on thisconcept we can now move on to the nextconcept in time speed and distanceokay we now move on to an interestingconcept called average speed suppose abody moves from a point X to a point yat a speed of you and the body thenretraces this path from the point y tothe point X at a speed V if I now askyou what is the average speed of thebody for the entire journey perhaps youwill say u plus V by 2 but that would bea wrong answer the average speed has tobe calculated from the first principleslet us see how we will then have aformula a handy and a ready formula foruse in all such questions so as I saidhere is a point X and here is a point ya body moves between these two pointswhich are located D units apart let ussay that the body which can be a car ora man or a plane governs the distance Xto Y at the speed of you could be metersper second or kilometers per hour ormiles per hour doesn't matter as long asboth sides is the same and then retracesthe same path at a speed of V we nowneed to calculate the average speed forthis entire exercise this entire journeyso let us beginwe know that speed is equal to distanceupon time distance traveled upon thetime taken to travel that distance thismeans that every speed for a journeywill be the total distance traveled uponthe total time taken to travel thatdistance now if this is the case then weknow that the total distance traveledwill be D plus D X 2y is d and y 2x is dand the total time taken is t1 thet-too now what is Steven the time takento go from X to Y okay but we know thattime is distance upon speed so t1 willbe d upon you and by the same logic t2will be d upon V so this will now helpus calculate the average speed in thisformula I just substitute and I get to Dupon D by u plus D by V is the averagespeed so we will now simplify this themoment I simplify this I get every speedwill be equal to 2 D upon D V Plus D u Iwill take you v to the top d will becommon V Plus u I will simplify and thefinal answer is 2 u v upon u plus V sothe formula for average speed that wehave just derived is equal to 2 u v uponu plus V where we know that U and V arethe speeds with which a fixed distancehas been traveled so take a look at thisderivation once again and remember thisis average speed which is the derivedquantity so u plus V by 2 will be awrong way of calculating it I hope thisentire derivation is correct and I alsohope that you have understood the samelogic can be extended to three legs of ajourney or four or five it does notmatter let us take up a question tounderstand this formula betterokay so here is the questiona farmer goes around an equilateraltriangle shaped field at speeds of x yand z kmph on the first second and thirdside respectively and reaches back tothe starting pointwhat's his average speed for the wholejourney now we need to solve this verysimple question using the understandingof average speed that we just developedlet's have a look at the screen this isthe derivation of a formula I hope youremember that we just did it so insteadof a journey of two legs I will now makeit a journey of three legs and the samederivation will help us here is thefield which is basically an equilateraltrianglelet me give ABC as the names to thevertices that is the ends now because itis an equilateral triangle the threesides are mutually equal let us say thelength of each side is d units onceagain it can be meters or kilometersdoesn't matter as long as all of themare in the same units so you have DDD itis given to us that the farmer movesalong a B at a speed of X along BC atthe speed of Y and along CA at a speedof Z and now we are asked to calculatehis average speed for the whole journeyso let us get startedaverage speed of the whole journey wouldbe total distance upon total time takenD plus D plus D upon the total time letus say T 1 plus T 2 plus T 3 but we knowthat speed is distance upon time sonaturally time will be distance uponspeed distance is d and the speed is Xfor the first leg of the journey and soon so let me substitute this in theformula so the average speed will beso let us substitute these values in thestep above and we get average speed willbe D plus D plus D which will be 3 Dupon T 1 plus T 2 plus T 3but T 1 we have just seen is D ebonics T2 we just saw is D by Y and T 3 we havejust seen is D by Z this is ourdenominator so all we have to do is tosimplify this and after simplificationour final answer for average speed forthis particular case will come out to be3 D upon XYZ will be the denominator forthis equation here or this fraction hereand we will have D Y Z plus D X Z plus DX Y upon X Y Z this horrible-lookingfraction is actually nothing because dgets cancelled out from the numeratorand denominator and X Y Z goes to thetop so you are left with 3 X Y Z upon Xy plus y Z plus Z X s the final answerthis is how this question is solvedhence every speed will be 2 u v upon uplus V when we have two speeds underconsideration or 3 uvw upon u v + UW + VW when we have three speeds underconsiderationI hope this concept of average speed isabsolutely clear and the formulae can beused directly to solve any kind ofquestion based on this let us move on toa fresh new conceptokay here is the new concept if twopersons start at the same time from twopoints a and B towards each other soperson starting from a towards B and aperson starting from B towards a at thesame time and after crossing each otherthere will be some point at which theywill meet they cross each other andafter crossing each other they take xand y arts in reaching B and arespectively then we have a formula thatspeed of the first upon speed of thesecond will be under root Y by X here isthe formula so this is a special formulafor a special case where these two aremoving towards each other and they tookx and y are respectively to reach theopposite sides let us take a question toillustrate the usage of this simpleconcept and formulaokay here is the question a man startsfrom b2k and another man starts from k2bat the same time after passing eachother they complete their journeys inthree integer one by three and fourinteger four by five Earth respectivelyif the speed of the first is 12 km/hfind the speed of the second man now itis very obvious that we can directlyapply the formula that we have juststudied speed of the first ball speed ofthe second is equal to under root Y by Xwhere x and y other times taken to reachthe opposite end so let's try to solveit solution speed of the first uponspeed of the second will be under rootfor integer 4 by 5/3 integer 1 by 3 letus simplify this further this is thesame as 24 by 5 divided by 10 by 3 whichif simplified further is the same as 36by 25 under root which is the same as 6by 5 but we know that the speed of thefirst man is 12 so 12 upon speed of thesecond man will be 6 by 5 which meansspeed of the second man which is theunknown which we are out to find will be12 into 5 by 6 which will be 60 by 6which will be 10 kmph as the answer sothis is our answer which we obtained bya direct application of the formula thatwe had studied hereI hope this formula and thisillustrative example both are clear nowyou can very well ask me how thisparticular formula was derived would yoube interested in quickly seeing thederivation of this formula ok let meshow you how this formula was derived inthe first place so we are out to derivethe formula that we have just studiedand used so here is the point a and hereis the point B let us say the first bodymoves from A to B at a speed of a thisis small a and let us say the secondbody moves from B to a at a speed of Bthis is small V these are their speedslet us say they meetthe point in between @p let me take thewhole distance as D capital D and let mesay the distance from A to B is d1 sonow we have to derive the formula thespeed of the first body which was movingfrom A to B at a speed of a divided byspeed of the second body which wasmoving from B to a at a speed of B willbe equal to under root Y by X where Yours is the time it has taken to coverp2 a the second body and X ours or Xunits of time does not matter is thetime that this body took to cover thedistance B to be very very simple and wewill just solve it when they meet at Ptimes are equal the time taken to coverAP will be equal to time taken to coverBP because they have started at the sametime and when they meet naturally theirwatches will show the same lapse of timeso this means that t1 is equal to t2when they beat at P for the first timewhich means d1 upon a will be equal to Dminus D 1 upon B ok this is our firstequation which we can now rewrite as D 1upon D minus D 1 is equal to a upon Blet us just write it and keep it with usnow one day a met at P and they havemoved on to their respectivedestinations then we know that the timetaken by the second body to cover thedistance P a at the speed of B unitswill be d 1 upon B but this time isgiven to us as Y I hope you know thatthat was the statement that was theoriginal concept statement and by thesame logic the time taken by the body tocover the distance P be at a speed of awill be equal to D minus D 1 upon a butthat is given to us as X just dividethis by this so that gives us D 1 upon Bupon D minus D 1 upon a is equal to Y byX so this value of D 1 upon D minus D 1can be directly used from here equation1 this is our second equation so tosimplify this second equation is nowrewritten as D 1 into a upon D minus D 1into B is y by Xbut we know that the value of D D 1 uponD minus D 1 is actually a by B just putthat value here into this expressionsubstitute it so that will give us a upon B in to a upon P this already existshere will be Y upon X and this isprecisely what we were looking for sothis now gives us a square upon B Squareis equal to Y upon X or speed of firstupon speed of second is equal to underroot of the times taken to cover thatdistance in the opposite directions andthis is of a formula which we used onthe last page has proved I hope thisderivation is completely clear to youthe reason I took up this derivation isconceptual clarity you can derive anyformula for a competitive exam it isadvisable to remember formulae which canbe applied directly but not allquestions will have direct applicationsand so my advice to you is to always beready to derive anything quickly italways helps let us move on to the nextconcepthere is the concept if a body moves atan average speed of Vivaan kmph to covera distance of D kilometres withoutstopping and moves at an average speedof v2 kmphto cover the same distance withstoppages one or more then the stoppagetime per R is given by v1 minus v2 uponv1 a very nice and elegant formula wehave with the help of which a certaintype of question can be solved directlylet us see one such questionhere is the question a drain travels ata speed of 60 kmph between two stations240 kilometers apart without stopping itgoes at an average speed of 40 km pHwhen it stops what is the averagestoppage time per R let us solve itsolution when the train is moving at aspeed of 60 kmph it covers a distance of240 kilometers so obviously the timetaken to cover this entire distance willbe distance upon speed which is 240 upon60 which is four R's now the same trainwhen it is moving at 40 kmph coveringthe same distance will now require 240 aball 40 which is equal to 6 hours so itis very obvious that earlier I took fourR's and now I am taking six hours so thedifference of these two times which havebeen taken which is two R's will be mytotal stoppage time but this stoppagetime has happened over a total time ofhow many hours six hours and so myanswer has to be two by six which is 1by 3 R's or R is my stoppage time thisis the answer which is 20 minutes perhour I am stopping instead of solving itthis way if you wish to apply theformula that we have seen a little whileago then you can apply it directly letus see using the formula we get v1 minusv2 upon v1 as the answer v1 is 6tv2 is 40 v1 is 60 which is 20 by 60which is 1 by 3 oursper our bingo we have the right answerso whichever way you wish to use it doit it won't take much time either ways Ihope that the concept and theillustrative question both are clear solet us move on ok now to reviseeverything that we have done let us takea simple test of 10 questions which wewill call quick questions here they areon the screen just take a quick look atthe 10 questions and then we will takethem up one by one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and10 so let us get started with the veryfirst one question number 1 what's thelength of a bridge which a man riding at15 km/h can cross in 5 minutes now weknow that distance is equal to speedinto time now in this case what are wehave to find distance which is thelength of that bridge what is the speedgiven to us 15 K mph km/h what is thetime given to us 5 minutes which is 5 by60 ours so the moment I solve it 15 and64 5 by 4 which is 1.25 and what will bethe unit kilometres hence our answer is1.25 kilometers I hope this is clear wecome to question 2 question 2 readsMukesh walks 10 kilometers in 5 hourshow much time will he take to travel 28kilometers now speed of Mukesh is givento us as 10 by 5 kilometers per hourten kilometers in five hour distanceupon time that is speed which isbasically two kilometers per hour howmuch time will he take to travel 28 km/h28 km/h and the speed is already knownto us which is 2 kilometers per hour soour answer will be 14 and what will bethe unit ours because 28 was kilometresand 2 is kilometer per hour sokilometers get cancelled our goes to thetop and you have 14 ours as the answer Ihope this is very clear we move on toquestion 3question 3 reads if a cyclist covers 11kilometers in 3 hours so the speed is 11by 3 km/h find the distance covered in 5hours so we know very well that distanceis speed into time so here distance willbe speed which is 11 by 3 into timewhich is 5 so our final answer will be53 55 by 3 kilometers be very cautiousabout the unit's there is no otherproblem otherwise so the answer here is55 by 3 kilometers 11 by 3 was km/h and5 was oursours is getting cancelled out I hopethis is clear we move on to question 4 aman walks at 5 km/h for 6 hours and at 4km/h for trailers find his average speednow your natural inclination will be todirectly apply the formula to UV upon uplus V because that is what we havestudied but that would be wrong becauseremember in that formula distancetraveled was same distance traveled whenwe covered the distance traveled when wewent at a speed of U was the same as thedistance traveled when we came back at aspeed of V here the distance itself ischanging so you have to go back to thefirst principles let us do that at 5kilometers per hour for 6 hours how muchwill I cover 30 kilometers at 4kilometers per hour for 12 hourshow much will I cover 48 kilometers soaverage speed will be total distanceupon total time this is the formula weuse there also so total distance will be30 plus 48 which is 78 upon total timetime is already known to us 6 hours plus12 hours so a final answer is 78 upon 18which is 13 by 3 kilometers per hourI hope this question is very clear wemove on to question number 5 questionnumber 5 walking at 3/4 of his usualrate a man is one and a half hours latefind the usual time we have alreadysolved this question earlier if I go at3/4 of my speed then it means that timeI will take will be 4/3 of my usual timewhich means I have taken one-third ofusual time extra and this is 1.5 hoursso the time which is my usual time willbe one point 5 into 3 which is 4 point 5ours is the answer I hope this is veryclear we move on to question number 6what's the ratio of speeds of two trainsone traveling at 45 km pH and another at10 meters per second now if you don'ttake care of the unit's you are dead sobe very careful about units okay so theratio would be 45 upon 10 meters persecond so converted to kilometers perhour by multiplying it by 10 by 5 wehave seen that so 45 divided by 10 into18 by 5 once this is solved it leads usfinally to the answer which is 5 by 4 Ihope this is very clear so the ratio ofthe speeds of these two trains is 5 isto 4 let's go on to question number 7it reads in a minute how many poles willa railway passenger pass by if they arespaced 50 meters apart and the Trainspeed is 60 kilometers per are now it'sa very very simple question because itsays that my speed is 60 kilometers perhour and there are poles telephone polesfor example spaced 50 meters apart sohow many can I see in one minute goingat the speed of 60 kmph so 60 kilometersI cover in one hour so 50 meters I'llcover in how much time so first of alllet us just find the time taken to reachthe first Pole so 50 meters is nothingbut point zero five kilometers so at aspeed of 60 kilometres which I cover inone are the time taken to cover pointzero 5 will be 0.05 upon 60 hours whichis the same as 5 by 6000 ours not thistimepoint 0 5 by 60 ours is the time takento see one pole so in one minutehow many poles will I see so point 0 5by 60 hours was needed to cross thefirst pole or was required to cross thefirst pole or was able to show us thefirst pole so in 1 minute which isbasically 1 by 60 hours I will see howmuch very simple 1 by 60 into 1 dividedby 0.05 upon 60 which is the same as 20which is our answer so this passengerwill be able to see 20 poles per minuteif he travels or rather the train inwhich is sitting travels at the speed of60 kmph I hope this is clear we move onto the next question question number 8question eight reads a 200 meter longtrain is moving at 60 km/h how long willit take to pass a pole a straight polehas no length so basically this questionmeans that how long will this trainmoving at 60 km/h take to travel adistance of 200 meters that means itsown length and in that duration it willcross that pole completely so the answeris fairly simple 60 kilometer I cancover in one hour so 200 meters which is0.2 kilometers I will cover in 0.2 upon60 ours so let us convert this intominute by multiplying it by 60 so I getpoint to minutes but 0.2 of a minute is0.2 of 60 seconds so our final answer is12 seconds so this train takes 12seconds to cross that pole completelywhich is equal to the time it takes tocover its own length of 200 meters wemove on to question number nine I wantedto meet a long train that's questionnine is moving at 54 km pH how long willit take to pass a tunnel 720 meters longso you have the total distance to betraveled by this train will be its ownlength plus the length of the tunnelthat is the time the train will takefrom the point the engine enters thetunnel to the point the last course theguards course for example exists thetunnel so the total distance to betraveled will be the length of thetunnel plus the length of the trainwhich is 180 plus 720 meters which is900 meters so the question basically nowbecomes how much time will a traintraveling at 54 kmph take to travel adistance of 0.9 kilometers so time isdistance upon speed so our answer is9 upon 54 so 0.9 upon 54 if you solve itthis is 0.9 kilometers and 54 iskilometres per our so in ours justconverted to minute multiplied by 60 60by 54 which is 10 by 9 this is 0.9 sothat will give you 1 minute and theanswer to this question is 1 minute justsimplify and you will get 1 minute asthe answer the last question of a quickquestion series question number 10 hereit is it reads a train running at 30meters per second takes 30 seconds tocross a platform 600 meters long what'sthe length of the train very simple sothe solution is fairly simple theplatform is 600 meters long and let ussay the trains length is X so it isobvious that 600 meters plus X metersdivided by this is the total length orthe distance that the train has traveleddistance upon time will be speed thetime it took to cover this was 30seconds so 600 plus X meters upon 30second is actually the speed of thetrain that is 30 30 meters per second so30 into 30 is 900 so this will give youX will be equal to 900 minus 600 andthat means the length of the train isnothing but 300 meters so that takescare of all these ten quick questionslet's go through them once again we sawthese 10 questions which was a very goodrevision of everything that we havestudied so far and before I move on tosome leading questions again you can nowrevise all these 10 and try practicingto solve these questions mentally okay Ihope this is clear so let us now getdown to some more questions so here is aquestion remains travel 600meters to reach home partly by train andthe rest by car he takes 8 hours if hetravels 120 kilometers by train and therest by carbut he would take 20 minutes more if hetravels 200 kilometers by train andthere is by car find the speeds of thetrain and the car and we have been givenfour options as well here is thesolution what is the total distancegiven to us 600 kilometres to reach homepartly by train and the rest by car nowremember the distance given to us is 600kilometres and this is the distance tohis home so this is fixed in the firstcase he takes a dars and in the secondcase he takes 20 minutes more so that is8 integer 1 by 3 hours 8 hours and 20minutesso it is very obvious that the equationswill be formed in terms of time now weknow time is distance upon speed so letus try to form the equation for thefirst condition partly by train and therest by car let's say the speeds off thetrain and the car be x + YK mphrespectively so our first equation wouldbe 1 20 upon X this is the time takenwhen he travels by train plus thebalance is 480 by Y because total is 600so 120 gives you 480 by y will be equalto 8 I hope this is the first equationand this is clear to yousimilarly 200 upon X because in thequestion he says if he travels 200kilometersby train in that case the time taken totravel by train will be distance uponspeed which is 200 by X plus 400 by Ywill be equal to 8 integer 1 by 3 whichis 25 by 3 this is the second equationI hope this equation is also very clearto you now we have to solve these twoequations and we are given four optionsif you are very smartworking with options one by one you cantry to fit in the values using theoptions and see if things fit let us trythe first option directly we will try tofit in the first option X is 30 and Y is40 if I put 30 here in this equation and40 here in this equation I get 120 by 30which will be 4 plus 480 by 40 whichwill be 12 so you have 4 plus 12 whichis definitely not 8 so option one iswrong take option to 60 and 80 120 by 60is 2 and 4 80 by 80 is 6 2 plus 6 is 8the first equation is satisfied so theanswer is 2 you can also try the samevalues with second equation 200 by 60plus 400 by 80 and you will definitelyget 25 by 3 so answer is option 2 incase you do not wish to work backwardsfrom options then let us try to solvethese two equations we will try andeliminate X from here 120 and 1200 sothe LCM will be + 200 sorry so the LCMwill be 1200 so let us multiply thefirst equation by 10 and let us multiplythe second equation by 6 so the moment Imultiply the first equation by 12 andthe second equation by 6 I get 1 2 0 0by x + 4 8 0 0 by y is equal to 80 andthe second equation multiplied by 6gives me 1 2 0 0 byx + 2 4 0 0 by y will be equal to 50 Ihope this is very clear to you now wehave to solve these two equations justsubtract and the moment you subtractthis directly get cancelled out and hereyou're left with 2400 by y is equal to30 and so y will be 24 upon 30 which isequal to 80 which is what the optionnumber 2 gives you so you don't need tocalculate for option the speed of Xbecause it's 60 just look at the optionand get it hence of our final answersare X is equal to 60 and y is equal to80I hope the solution is very clear youcan once again have a look at thecomplete solution here this is a goodquestion and we have seen how to solvethe question working backwards from theoptions as well as working directlyusing the two equations I hope this isvery clear to you now we move on to thenext question excluding stoppages thespeed of ammo by is 63 kilometers perhour and including stoppages it is 36 kmpH the number of minutes per R for whichthe mobike stops is here is the solutioninitially the speed of the bike was 63game pH and later on the speed of thebike became 36 km pH here there were nostoppages and here there were stoppagesso this means that if I take thedifference this is the distance inkilometers which is covered extra when Iam moving at this speed so thedifference beingin kilometers this is the distance whichis covered extra when I do not stop soit is very obvious that the time forstoppage is equal to the time in which Icover 27 kilometers at the speed of 63km pH this equation will give us thefinal answer so it is very obvious 63kilometersI cover in 60 minutes so 27 kilometers Iwill cover in how many minutes 27 into60 upon 63 and the answer here comes outapproximately 25 point seven one minuteswhich is option number one the optionsare very close so approximation would bedifficult so we have solved it and wehave got twenty five point seven one asthe answer I hope this is very clearthis for the good question we move on tothe next the next question reads astudent walks to school at the rate of 2point 5 kmph and reaches 6 minutes toolatenext day he increases his speed by 2kmph and then reaches the school 10minutes early good he has learned hislessons well the distance of the schoolfrom his home is and we are given fouroptions here is the solution to solvethis question it is important tounderstand that the distance is fixed Ihope this is very clear to you thedistance from his home to school isfixed and we know very well thatdistance is speed into time let us saythe usual time that the student takes toreach the school is Tso now our equation would be D is equalto speed which is 2.5 into when he goesat two point five he is six minutes latesix minutes is 1 by 10 hours so T plus 1by 10 because we are taking T in us andspeed in kmph but distance also is speedwhich is 2 into the next day he reaches10 minutes early GERD now what happensthe next day the next day he increaseshis speed by 2 kmph so now the distanceis fixed to point 5 goes up by 2 becomes4 point 5 and he takes 10 minutes lessso that will be t minus 1 by 6 because10 minute is 1/6 of an hour all we haveto do is compare these two equations nowand when I compare and solve these twoequations I can easily get the value ofT which will be won by two R's but thatis not the question the question is whatis the distance so all I need to do issubstitute the value of T in either thisor this so let us substitute this in thefirst equation and we get D will beequal to this is moved down let me takeit slightly up D will be equal to 2point 5 into 1 by 2 plus 1 by 10 so thatwill be 2 point 5 into 6 by 10 and thatgives me the value of D finally as 1.5kilometers which in our option wasoption number 1 this is the answer Ihope the solution is absolutely clear toyou a very very elegant and simplesolution based on fixed distanceokay so let's move on to the next onethe next question a cyclist starts fromDelhi towards Gurgaon which is hundredkilometers away he is able to maintain aspeed of 20 km page in the first R afterwhich the speed Falls to 18 kmph he isable to maintain the speed for the nextstar after which it falls to 16.2 km/hwhich also he maintains for an hour inthe fourth R he is able to maintain aspeed of 14.5 8 kmph and so on how muchtime approximately does it take to reachBuddha and we are given four optionshere is the solution you will have toobserve the speeds carefully let uswrite down the speeds 20 becomes 18becomes sixteen point two becomes 14point five eight this is the first starthis is the second R this is the third Rthis is the fourth R and so on and thequestion is when does he reach Guga 20and 18 as you can see clearly 20multiplied by 0.9 will be 18 18 and 16point 2 there is a difference of 1.8 itis very obvious 18 into 0.9 will besixteen point two so the clue we get isthat the speeds are decreasingconsistently by 10 percent or this isthe GP with 0.9 as the reducing ratiosixteen point two into point nine againgives you one point six two less whichis fourteen point five eight and so whatwe have to now do is we have to keep onadding till we get a sum of 100 and thenwe have to get the exact answer so letus see let us try to do that fourteenpoint five eight into point nine givesme fourteen point five eight less onepoint four five eightthat gives me thirteen point one to twoagain let me reduce this by this was thefifth are actually again let me reducethirteen point one two five point ninethat gives me eleven point eight onethis is the six star but if I add up Ihave not reached hundred so far becauseI haven't again I reduce this by tenpercent 11.81 into 0.9 that will give mearound ten point six three and so on butif I add I can see that I have crossed100 by now at the end of the six starthe cumulative distances travel you canmake a table on this side also you canadd up here this will be 38 here 20 plus18 that would be 38 so I add thisfurther I get fifty four point two I addthis I get sixty eight point seven eighteighty one point nine ninety three pointseven one and here bingo we have crossedthis so it is obvious that gurga wasreached in the middle somewhere here soafter the six star and that is obviousbecause all the four options also tellus the same thing but here after the sixstar the speed is ten point six threekilometers per our we are moving at thisparticular pace and six hours are goneand we are left with hundred minusninety three point seven one so at thespeed of ten point six three kmph wehave to now cover the remaining distanceif you calculate it that value will cometo be around thirty six minutesthat is our answerso this is a slightly clerical questionbecause values had to be added up butthere is no other way of solving it andapproximation cannot work here becauseall other options are also six arts andsomething had it been five hours orseven hours then the only option withsuccess would have been correct but hereyou will have to actually calculate thatonce you are at ninety three point sevenone then the balance distance that youhave to cover which is six point twonine kilometers at a speed of ten pointsix three will take 36 minutes I hopethis is absolutely clear we move on tothe next question okay the questionreads n we start at the same time from Land M to go to MN l a distance of fortytwo kilometers their speeds are four andthree kmph respectivelythey meet at a point n then go to ml andreturn and meet at D find the distance Dn here is the solution this is L andthis is M a is starting from here and Bis starting from here the total distanceis given to us as 42 kilometershe says that their speeds are four andthree first they meet at n let us saythis is n now I have drawn n slightlycloser to M because a is faster theyhave met at n then they reach M and Land return and meet at D let us say thisis d so the question is what is thevalue of D n DN is to be found this isthe question not too difficult let's getcracking when they meet first for thefirst time when they meet for the firsttime we will have to remember that thetotal distance traveled is equal to n nplus MN which is actually the wholedistance 42 then they go to MN L so thatmeans they again cover a distance of howmuch 42 and then their return and meetat D so that means they have againcovered a distance of how much 42 sothat means when they meet at D thedistance traveled by both of themtogether has been 42 plus 42 plus 42 wehave just seen that and the totaldistance they have travelled hasactually become equal to 126 kilometersso I hope this is very clear nowso when a meets be @n the times theyhave taken to travel are the same and weknow by the basic principle that whenthe time taken is the same then thedistance is covered very directly as thespeed and so that means that distancecovered by a when he meets B for thefirst time at n will be 4 upon 4 plus 3this is the ratio of the speeds for n 3401 4 plus 3 into 42 total distance hasbeen broken down into these twoquantities so the distance travelled bya which is actually equal to L n isgiven by this equation 4 by 7 into 42which is 4 into 6 which is which is 4 by7 into 42 which is Ln and which comesout to be equal to 24 so L n is 24 themoment we know that L n is 24 we knowthe value of MN perhaps we may not needit when B meets a at D the totaldistance traveled by B till that time weknow that together they have covered 126so how much would be have covered whenhe meets a for the first time at theratio of the speeds 3 upon 4 plus 3 into126 so this gives you 54 kilometers butwe know very well that this 54kilometers which is the distancetraveled by B is actually equal to ml +LD but M L is already known to us whichis 42 so this means that the value of LDis now known and LD is 54 minus 42 whichis equal to 12meters so LD is known to us which is 12if you look at this diagram here we havejust found out LD which is 12 butremember we had already found out thevalue of L n the distance travelled by awhen he met B for the first time whichwas 24 so the difference is 12 which iswhat we had to find out and the answeris 12 which is option 2 I hope thissolution is very clear to you this ishow we have solved it using the firstprinciples and the final answer isoption 2 which is 12 so that my dearfriend was the complete session on timespeed and distance I hope you enjoyed itrevise it thoroughly get your conceptsin place and try to solve questionsmentally wherever possible I wish youall the best in application of whateveryou have learned all the bestyou
