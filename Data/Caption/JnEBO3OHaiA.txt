not divided that's a 12-foot tall snow sculpture and we did that in Breckenridge Colorado so here is a Mobius band that makes three twists okay by itself you know we don't care about the shape the Mobius band by itself is really no different to a mathematician than the rubber band it's just a loop okay we're not looking at the cross-section and the whether it's twisted or not it's just they're looking at the center line of the nut that defines the nut but once you take the mobi span and you split it down the middle it becomes a knot now it happens to be a trefoil knot because now if you have these strands being nice and soft you can move them around and they would be interlinked in exactly the same way as this copper structure if it's only singly twisted it will simply open up in a loop that's twice the size and actually has a full twist in it so it depends on how much twist it is if the mobis band is even more twisted like five times you may get this other knot that we had labeled as five sub one or something like that which seal gives an ever more coiling of that same thing we started out with a trefoil knot now and so here is roughly a trefoil knot and then we split this trefoil knot down the middle because it happens in this trifle not to be of a möbius structure so let me back up a little bit and show you two different try foils there to artistic trefoil knots i kind of call them like you know trefoil standing on its own two feet because they were carefully designed so that you know I can actually sustain them up they're not gonna topple over can you see a difference well I'm claiming one of them is a Mobius band and the other one is not let's figure out you know whether this one is twisted so I'm starting on the site or it's a camera up on the lobe here and I'm running my finger slowly down here I get to the underside of this foot I'm coming to the front here I'm getting around I'm staying here on the upper side of that foot I'm coming up here and I'm back started so masa on the same side so this one is double-sided okay I could paint this Irene and I could paint the other one red and everything would be fine but now let's compare that to the other Mobius band if I'm starting here again on your site I'm moving down here I'm getting to the bottom of this foot on the bottom of this highly curved little thingy I'm going through the middle staying at the bottom here staying at the bottom side coming around being at the bottom of this foot now I'm coming up the backside and so basically I'm coming off to the backside and I've gotten to the other side if I continue again sliding down here being on the upper side sliding over on the upper side here coming back and I'm coming back to where I started but I had to go around the loop twice Mobius and in that process I would have painted everything green right and there's no way I can paint one of the other side without the two colors running into one another at some point this is the idea of a Mobius triple knot and then we took a slightly different shape of again you can see this looks roughly like a a trifle not except it started out with a cross-section that was more or less you know rectangular originally but then we carved out the middle part to make essentially a split and because it's a mobis band when I do this I get a knot that is not really divided that's why we call it not divide it it's like a rollercoaster if you start on this side of the big lobe and you go around the whole roller coast by the time you come the first time back up on the mountain you're actually are on the other side and then you have to go once through more through the roller-coaster until you come back to where you started so it's just one long string you know essentially tied together and while when it was still fused without the gap in the middle it was a trefoil knot now it's a much more complicated knot how many crossings does this thing have actually not that easy to see but that was amazed at msri you know it's like a seven-year-old kid and I show them that and within seconds he said twelve and he realized wherever we had a crossing in our trifle not we now had split that we now get four crossings we have this situation and so indeed he is right you know now we have three times four crossings it's a 12 crossing knot so by the time you're kind of looking through the knot table you're already you know very far down there where there's thousands of different nuts right and that's just one of them I probably Christ is not I'm pretty sure that some of them are because I mean that makes kind of fun you know you wanna many of them has of these like figure eight configuration to go sometimes around the loop and then they go through the figure eight by the time you go a couple of times through the middle with figure eight it is very likely that they things are not it but you can never be quite sure there's some very complicated looking knots that you can find on the internet like when you look for something like difficult unknot or difficult trivial knot they show you not that you swear this is a real knot but actually it's not experimental part of DNA topology so the field is called the innate apology we study geometry and topology of circular DNA molecules or linear DNA molecules that locally behave a circles same with this one except it goes back so such the front curls back hold on the way down now you're going to take this lace put it under that loop
