but what makes it geometric is thatyou're multiplying by the same ratio thesame number to get to the next term soI'm going to show you a formula we'regonna be using here and that's this onehere a sub N equals a sub 1 times R tothe N minus 1 power a sub 1 is the firstterm R is the ratio what you'remultiplying by and is whatever term youwant to find so if you want to find the10th term N equals 10 and so on so goingback to this example here we're startingat 3 and you can see N equals 1 meansthis is our first term N equals 2 thatmeans that's the second term N equals 3is the third and so on but a sub 1 meansthat's the value of the first term a sub2 see this is a little subscript it justtells you that that's the term you're onthe second term the value of that termis 6 and so on so if we wanted to findthe let's see one two three four fifthterm okay N equals five we would startat three and we would multiply by twoonce twice three times four times okaywhy not five timeswell we already started at three thefirst term so we only had to multiply bythe common ratio - one less number oftimes okay because we were already herewe just took four times that's where theN minus one comes from and now the ratiowhy do they call it a ratio they call ita ratio because if you take this numberthis term and you divided by theprevious term 24 divided by 12 equals to12 divided by 6 equals two and sixdivided by three equals two so if youtake the term divided by the one beforeit that gives you the ratio and that'swhat you're multiplying by to moveforward to the next term and so on sosay we want to find the 10th term wellwe could keep multiplying by two okaywhich that's one way to do it that's arecursive way that would be like this asub 1 equals 3 a sub N equals a sub nminus 1 that just means you go back tothe previous term and you add not add inthis case you're multiplying by 2 rightokay so that's a recursive way to writethe formula you keep going back one termsee and mineone and then you multiply by two if youwant the sixth term you go back to thesix minus one the fifth term youmultiply by two but this is an explicitformula it takes you right there and sowhat you have is you have we want tofind the 10th term so we start off withthe first term which is three we'remultiplying by two nine times becausewe're already at three to get to thetenth term we just have to multiply oneless time and so this is just going tobe three times two to the ninth that'sthe value of the tenth term now if youwere to plot these points like if wewere to draw this on a coordinate axisso term number one is three term numbertwo is six term number three is twelveand if you can see this it's going up ata faster and faster rate this isactually an exponential okay anexponential curve whereas when we didthe arithmetic ones who is linear wasgoing up at a constant rate you keptadding that common difference here we'remultiplying by the ratio and you can seeit looks like an exponential equationthat variable is in the exponent okay sothat's how you work with this when theygive you a list well what happens ifthey just give you two terms like thefifth term is 80 and the eighth term isfive foursthey tell us it's a geometric sequencebut find the 12th term hmm how do wehandle that well what we're going to dois we're going to write a system ofequations so what we're going to do iswe're going to say the fifth term is 80the first term we don't know the ratiowe also don't know but 5 minus 1 is 4okay then we're going to say all rightthe eighth term so the eighth term isfive fours we don't know the first termwe don't know the ratio but we know that8 minus 1 is 7 so now we have twoequations ok two variables and we cansolve that system so what we're going todo something maybe a little bitdifferent than you've seen before we'regoing to actually divide so when wedivide see how the a 1s cancel oneanother out seven minus four when youdivide and you have the same base yousubtract the exponents remember that soit's R cubed equals 5/4 dividedby 80 when you divide by a fraction it'slike multiplying by the reciprocal sothis is five fourths times 180 I'm goingto reduce five goes in here once fivegoes in here 16 times so this is onesixty-fourth equals R cubed if you takethe cube root of both sides you can seethat R equals one-fourth okay okay sonow we know the ratio if we put it backin to any one of these equations maybeI'll just put it back into this oneright here we get eighty equals a subone 1/4 to the fourth power which is asub one times one over 256 if wemultiply both sides excuse me by 256 weget the first term which is I want to dothat on the calculator real quick hereit's 80 times 256 20 thousand fourhundred and eighty twenty thousand fourhundred eighty so if we put it all backtogether we've got a sub N equals thefirst term just 20 thousand four hundredand eighty okaytimes the ratio which is one-fourth tothe N minus one power okay so this isour formula our explicit formula if wewant to find the twelfth term a sub 12all we have to do is put in 12 there
