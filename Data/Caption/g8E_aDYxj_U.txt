all right now it's four so that's whatwe're gonna do binomial distributionstoday for statistics it's prettyinteresting pretty challenging but Ithink you can get it thinking againlet's first have a discussion start withthe real world problem supposeaccording to retail market group isactually true information retail marketgroup says that the probability of anyone recognizing the brand McDonald's is95% so does that make senseprobability that anyone working I threethousand ninety five percent that'snineteen out of twenty people that oneperson you know is like whatever yeahsuppose we select five people enemywhat's the probability that all fivewill recognize McDonald's so we cananswer that questionafter today what's the probability thatonly four will recognize McDonald'sgiven that each person's probability is95% and what was the probability ofthree people or two or one or zero wecan do all that stuffafter today okay and that's what thisfield helps us discoverso let's first understand what thisscenario means this scenario is called abinomial distribution and has fourcharacteristics let's talk about it in abinomial distribution first of all whatis by h1 right so it's - it's basicallycomparing between yes or no okay and ithas that's the fixed number independentthat's the last one here successfullyfailurehere we go let's start with this onemore we go in order fixed number ofchild so in this case five people fivepeople are being selected person 1person 2 person 3 2004 that's impartimportant about binomial next isindependentis it true like if I surveyed you andfind out whether you know McDonald'sthat won't affect whether you knowMcDonald's is that true your did youknow it or you don'tso each child is independent from eachother does that make sense okay and thenthe third is that its success or failurethat's by either success or failure twocategories there's no overlappingcategories so we need to recognizeMcDonald's or you don'tand finally the probability of successremains the same in all cases okay soit's always 95 percent per person nowlet's see if we can answer the questionwhat is the probability that all fiverecognize McDonald's so we've done thisit's a probability evolving or or andwhich one and and it is is it safe tosay that the probability of the firstperson recognizing McDonald's and thisperson and this person and a and M wouldbe all 5w all five okay so once they'reprobably building it the first personrecognizing the brand carat that isdecimal four nine five for this personthe probability the second person onenine five word and for herwhat are the chances of getting a strikelet's do a case study so is it safe tosay that we want probability of person 1& 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 so what are you doingyour ending them yeah pointsseven seven three seven seven threewhich is what percent seventy sevenpoint three percent let's open it for asecondthat makes x is that is that realisticfour point seven seven four okay andbecause you round this yeah all rightlet's do that and then it sort of makessense hopefully it makes sense and theidea is that yeah if there's a 95%chance of each person then when it makessense that as you get more and morepeople the probability of all of them isgoing to decrease slit yeah yeahquestions about that who doesn'trecognize people that are in villages orpeople that are worldwide Ohor what breaking ball in yeah now let'sshy probability of for recognizingmetallics okay so this is there's fivelines here so what's the probability thefirst percent plane that honey let's dopoint ninety five next so I meant bynext night when I try it next and thelast first elephant point point oh fiveone this is a person thank you forasking is the person who does notrecognize McDonald's would it make sensethat if there's a 95% chance ofrecognizing there's a 5% chance of nodsis that what you're gonna askyeah that's right I saw one of these yessure totallywhat's the probability of recognizingMcDonald's 95 percent you what's theprobability of them not recognizing mefive percent and this is four out offive recognizing okay alright so wewould do this except there was a problemthere's a problem here because this isonly one scenario this is the scenarioof recognized recognized recognizedrecognized notswhat well then it could be like nobecause this has been probability thatthe fifth person crap but the numberwould be any different appointed by mr.wood it's another way you can arrangefive people recognize another propertymultiplicatively whoa with regards tomultiplication the math is the samecorrect you're saying that if four pointfive over here the number I'd be thesame if you multiplyhowever the situation was different thesituation is this is only acknowledgingthe fifth person not recognizing thebrand McDonald's what about a fourthperson or the third but a second or thefirstthat could also happenedso this problem becomes now complicatedbut it would be the same it would bethis will be the same for each yeah yeahso do you agree that this is one way itcan happen that four out of fiverecognize McDonald's another way wouldbe if one of five is here and the samenumber the same probabilityanother way of 25 is here or here matteror here the order matters in terms ofwhich person recognizes in but itdoesn't matter like it doesn't have tobe like the first person recognized itdoesn't like there's no like specificdoesn't have to it just we have toacknowledge that everybody has theopportunity to not recognize well sayeveryone has the opportunity to be theperson who does not recognize it there'ssuch an equal opportunity yes so if youlook closely this is one scenario andthere are five of them so this is weakthis becomes a challenging problem let'sactually flip the page go here cuz Idon't want you to do that every timelet's read this the realize the numberof arrangements down for successes orsuccesses in one failure is 5c4there are let's redefine that this meansthe number of ways to arrange that's acombination I'm a race to arrange whator it doesn't necessarily matter hereit's just a different group four thingsout of how many fine so this is thenumber of arrangements of four out offive to choose from can we get thisnumber please it is fine in other wordsif you have five people you have fivepeople the number of groups of fourexisting inside would be fine thinkabout that for a second is that okayokay yeah yes if you have five peopleif you have five people the number ofdifferent groups of four is fine firstin one two three four that's one groupone two three five that's another groupone two four or five that's anothergroup and two three four five I get amonth one three four five I've missed onthembasically moving this one over this isone group one two three four we movethis one over one two three five movethis one over one two four five onethree four five there's your five groupsof four I feel like this is that crucialmoment where there I'm gonna make orbreak the lesson this is it this is themoment either we're gonna get it or notso this is the math behind it there arelet's put it up here I typed these notesmyself a very proud this is five ways toarrange a group of four these are thefour successes and this is the onefailure so this results in point two ohthree six twenty percent or so okayin other words remember this math wasfrom above here this is for successesone failure we do thatthis is 0.95 to the four and this is0.05 to the one but how many of thesescenarios existfive five five I can't describe howrelieved I am how much you said thatthis is one scenario right let me askyou this Cornelius what if I can be dereright okay and that's this scenario 95five nine five nine five oh five butpoint oh five could also be here rightthat's another scenario he wouldn'tstill be four nine five and a no fivefour four nine five seven oh fivehundred and that's another one of theseso there's five of these there's fiveways we can do this it's not okayyou're sure just five ways we can dothis but they're all the samemathematically speaking by thecommutative properties by demonstratedup here where it doesn't change the mathwe're always doing four successes in onefailure but this is the number of groupsof that the number of times that'spossible as we said here withEcclesiastes he said the number of waysto give an opportunity for the personwho does not know now I'm going to giveyou some really good news I'm going togive you some really really good newsyou can do all this on the calculatorall of this on the calculator and that'swhere we break off from the traditionalstatistics model we're going to give youone more example numerically this is theprobability that three out of fiverecognize the brand so how many groupsof three exists out of five can you tellme how many groups of threes is sevenfive put it up fiveit's ten huhoh yes so there's ten so who said didyou say timecan you explain what ten bees I'll startyou off with there are um so in threefive right uh there's ten possible waysto have three successes out of fivethat's right there's ten ways to havethree out of five so in other words backup to this scenario I was like this ithelps me there's ten ways to have 395 sand 205 say there's ten ways to do thatbut the math is always the same the mapis always the same there's ten ways butyou're still going to have three ofthese and two of these and that willresult in twenty one percent Yes Doctorprobability is the probability yes onlytwo percent things that's yourprobability of only three people out offive that make sense is that does thatlike fit ninety five percent of peoplerecognize McDonald's have three out offive of them maybe it's pretty low Idon't know how it went down that muchbecause ninety five is very high so theprobability the probability of tworecognizing or scuse me the probabilityof two where to go not recognizing thisthing the two not recognizing makes thefraction very small 0.05 squared ispoint zero two five see how many thismakes the number the result very smallcompanies yeah like McDonald's it'sreally important to get the most numberof people time to see your product thisis what we're getting at yeah numberlike out of five people losing oneperson really drops out heroes chancesyour ass giving the right path now theidea is that the reason this is so lowthe reasons to murder second is so lowthree out of five recognizing isactually good for McDonald's becausethey're acknowledging that the chancesthat two people do not recognize bringsthe probability very low its point ohfive times 0.05 and that makes thisultimately this makes ways down thepercentile for the percentage and bringsit really low so it's actually good forthem yes that's point oh five times 0.05that's the square and then you can dopoint nine five three times can someonegive you this number put an eight fiveseven point eight five seven so if youmultiply these three you'll get a pointno two one four okay now the good newslet's go into the calculator it'sfascinating that it actually existsthere so here it is the calculation isby no Madea binomial distribution okayit works as follows of NPR no punintendedthat is the pun but I don't intend it tobe okay let's actually explore so whydon't you get here and I'll catch up toyou hits second bears clear this secondwhere'd it gothere's initially methodlater oh it's down there binome pediawell scroll out the a Hyundai I'm gonnado againyeah Jordan come there is getting outgetting out there you goso hits second and then the Bears keyand now scrolling down scroll it downand we said in the front here is alpha astop bone you actually have it here manyof you don't have it this way you justhave it like sort of okay when the seesnothing is no different I'll just giveit to you it'll be like binome PDF andit goes like thatokay first step so whoa Bethel is a tagmy wall okay and is the first one numberof trials in this case the number oftrials is five so we put five in for anumber of chats five now I'm gonna takethe vandalism off okayfineP is the probability of success what isthe probability of success or not fiveif you're doing it to reduce 3x oh youput comma like it's kamek kamek what isCharliewhat child is the number of peopleyou're taking to recognize the brand inthis case it's my name so probability ofsuccess for each person's point ninefive again this is fixed this does notchange that's part of thecharacteristics of a binomial and the xvalue is the number of successes howmany successes do we want in thisparticular case the most recent one weneed three let's put three in enter andpaste and in fact it gives it to us thesame way you have it in your calculatoryour pattern it's very exciting it'svery exciting because your have to dealwith the whole lengthy formula let'sverify that we get the same thing forfive successes to probably did at thebeginning so the way that we call thisby the way if you don't know is secondenter if you'd second enter it brings itright back up the last thing you justdid and now so let's do it a number oftrials five chance for success pointnine five number of successes what do wewant to do now the first problem we didfirst one before that five let's do fivewhat do we expect to see before we hitenter point seven seven thirty yeahlet's do four it's a very good it's likethat's such a relief honestly becausewhy do I deal with all the formulacrunching it gets away from the pointI'd rather discuss the problem contextchewing with you and then just let youcalculate it like normalhey I'm dude yeah there is no one do Ithought you said there's someone holdit's not undo funnest yeah there's asecond insert you can insert stuff Ihave in a second delete okayready for the advanced calculator one yoyeah you are it's just as cool as thissomebody gives you more functionality ifyou think this is cool then you likeokay the next one is actually using thetables you could actually say I don'twant it for a set number of child'swatch let's go back here if I go secondmentor bring it back let's clear thisclear enter okay look closelythis is the number of trials this is thesuccess for child have I discussed howmany successes I want yet no I haven'tdiscussed so this will do it for everysingle situation so cool this will do apharmacy so I hit enter is any questionsabout that I haven't discussed successeshere so what do you put in Thanks I meantrial P P would be point nine five X youleave blank blank menu to get this nowthis is the list this is the list ofanswers this is the list of answers sonow what we're gonna do is we're gonnastore this it's store and store myanswer my answer is a list of numbersI'm going to store it into the column lii ii ii will give you l2 so store itinto l2 and now let's look at the tableby hangingthe stores right here stop edit I wantedto clear this out I want to clear thisout so yeah it's there it's there I wantto clear my tables so I'm going to clearmy tables that second memory or clearall this here all this there we go I'mgonna do it again shall we do it againyeah it's gonna get sweet so secondenter second enter second enter okaygrab this we hit enter the answer isthis is the list of numbers for allsuccesses all successes are here as alist I want to take my answers and storethem store my answer list into thecolumn l2 l2 is accessible by thebuttons second to right here second toand you notice we see store into l2 hitenter now have stored my list into l2 Igo to stat and edit and they're therethis is these are the answers for eachnumber of successes 0 successes 1success 2 successes 3 or and 5 do thesenumbers look familiar based on our whatwe've been calculating because wehaven't done it so the chance of no onerecognizing MacDonnell's out of fivepeople is exceedingly oncethe chance of one person out of fiverecognising McDonald's is also verysmall besides every mutation three times10 to the negative five right so it'sbasically four zeros and threeexceedingly exceedingly small and whenthat makes sense what it makes sense onezero zero zero zero very sorry that ifthere's a 95% chance of recognizeMcDonald's for each person that if oneout of five recognizes that chances arepretty low that you get like probablymore than one person and then this isthe chance of two people three peopleout of five four people out of five fivepeople out all right and what do youthink all these numbers add up to ahundred percent good job numericallywhich is table stack because you didreally well good jobthank you everyone say goodbye
