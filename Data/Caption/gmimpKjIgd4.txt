eight is going to be an even number nowlet's say someone gets really reallyhungry and they decide to come and takethese away from me now I have this muchI'm not sure how many because I haven'tcounted yet and I need to decide if it'san even or odd number once again I'mgoing to try to put them into pairs so Ialready have this pair then I'm going totake these two and put them into a pairand then I'm going to put this one intoa wait I can't put this piece of candyinto a pair there's not another piece ofcandy to put it with since I cannot putthis into another pair I realize thatthis is an odd numberI cannot pair this number so one twothree four five is an odd number I havetwo here two here and one all by itselffive is an odd number let's take a lookat this whiteboard and see how many evenor odd magnets we have oh wait I can'tmove these magnets is too strong itlooks like we're going to have to thinkof another way to figure out the evenand odd numbers I have an idea I can putthem into pairs by adding a circlearound twos when we find twos let's dothat together let's look at this top rowright here and count how many magnets wehave here's one two three four let's goahead and put them into pairs this is apair and this is a pair so four is aneven number because it can be put intoequal pairs let's look at the next rowhere's one two three four five six someof you are probably already catching onand you can tell right away is this aneven or odd number well let's see let'sput these into pairs and figure out ifthis is going to be even or odd let'scircle these two and these two and thesetwo look if you said even then you areright because they can all be put intopairs great job there are six magnetshere that can be put into pairs whichmakes six an even number now let's lookat this last rowis one two three four five six sevenlet's go ahead and put these into pairsto see if we have an even or odd numberlet's put these two together and thesetwo together and these two together andoh we can't put this into a pair becausethere's not another magnet to pair itwith right away we should recognize thatthis is going to be an odd number werealize we can't put it with anythingelse so seven is an odd number
