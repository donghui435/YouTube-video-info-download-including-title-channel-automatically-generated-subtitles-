think of this green thing as astationary point from this point sayyou're running towards the right at thespeed of 10 km/h this point isstationary and you are running towardsthe right at some speed how far fromthis point will you be after one hourI'm asking your simple questionthis point is stationary and you arerunning towards the right at a speed of10 km/h where will you be after one houryou will be somewhere here 10 kilometersaway from the starting point when itcomes to speed this is the concept weare used to we relate our position to astationary point here every hour we willkeep moving 10 kilometers further awayfrom this point and that's why we saythat the speed is 10 kilometers per hourrelative to this stationary object butlet's think of another situation takethe stationary point from this point atravels at the speed of 5 km/h to theright and B travels in the samedirection at the speed of 10 km/h bothleave the starting point at the sametime now I ask you another question whatis the speed of B relative to a you arenot asked for the speed of B relative tothe stationary point you are asked forthe speed of B relative to a let's zoomout to make some space here to know therelative speed let's look at theirpositions after one hour don't forgetthey leave at the same time so a will besomewhere here 5 kilometers away fromthe starting pointthat's because a travels at fivekilometers per hour and as B travels at10 kilometers per hour it would besomewhere here 10 kilometers away fromthe starting pointnow I had asked you the speed of Brelative to a so we have to find thedistance between a and B after the firsthour if this distance is 10 and this oneis 5 the distance in between will be 5kilometers what does this tell us ittells us that the distance between themhas increased by 5 kilometers after onehour if they travel for one more hourthe distance between them will increaseby 5 morekilometres it will be 10 kilometers sowe say that the speed of B relative to ais 5 km/h the gap between them increasesby 5 kilometers every hour and how didwe get this 5 it is the difference ofthe speeds of B and a it is 10 minus 5kilometers per hour if two bodies leaveat the same time and are traveling inthe same direction then the relativespeed will be the difference of theirindividual speeds to understand thefirst case imagine you're seated on theback seat of a car and you see thestationary object when you start movingat 10 kilometers per hour you see thatthe distance between you and that objectis increasing and to understand thesecond case imagine you are in thebackseat of the car and there is a carright next to you now both start movingat the same time you move at 10kilometers per hour and the other carmoves at 5 kilometers per hour thedistance between your car and the otherone is increasing yes but at a slowerrate as compared to the previous caseand that is why the relative speed islower in the second case you are movingaway from a car at a slower rate ascompared to the rate at which you aremoving away from the stationary objectbut what if the two cars are moving inthe opposite directions let's see thisis the green stationary point car amoves towards the left at the speed of 5kilometers per hour and car B movestowards the right at the speed of 10kilometers per hour and both cars leaveat the same time what will be therelative speed here where will the Kospiafter 1 hour let this be the startingpoint the speeds of 5 and 10 kilometersper hour so car a will be somewhere here5 kilometers away from the startingpoint and D will be here 10 kilometersaway from the starting point what is thedistance between them after one hourit's 15 kilometers the distance betweenthem increases at the rate of 15kilometers per hour that's the relativespeed every hour the distance betweenthem will increase by 15 kilometers butthere is another case of cars moving inopposite directionsassume that cars a and B of 40kilometers apart Kara moves towardsright at the speed of 5 km/h and car Bmoves left at the speed of 10 km/h theyare moving towards each other but itstill opposite directionswhat is the relative speed here what doyou think to know the answer let's seethe positions after one hour this is theoriginal distance which is 40 kilometersafter one hour car a will be here fivekilometers away from this point and carB will be here ten kilometers away fromthis point what happened here an hourago the distance between a and B was 40kilometers what's the distance betweenthem now the total is 40 minus 5 minus10 will give us 25 kilometers it was 40initially and is 25 after one hour thedistance between them reduced by 15kilometers 40 minus 25 is 15 kilometersand that is why the relative speed herewill also be 15 kilometers per hour howdo we get this 15 it is the sum of theindividual speeds 10 plus 5 kilometersper hour so if two things start at thesame time and move in the same directionthe relative speed will be thedifference of the individual speeds andif they start at the same time and movein the opposite directions the relativespeed will be the sum of the individualspeeds in the next few sessions we willlook at examples based on the concept ofrelative speedyou
