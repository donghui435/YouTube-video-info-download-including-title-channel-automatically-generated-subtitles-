in this video we're talking about how tosolve radical equations and there aretwo really important things to rememberwhen you're solving radical equationsthe first is you're always trying toisolate the radical in your equationonto its own side of the equation thereason you want to isolate it so thatyou can square both sides of theequation because when you square asquare root those two things cancel withone another and you'll just be left withwhat's inside the square root that's howwe're going to eliminate the square rootsign from the equation in order to solvefor our variable the second thing youneed to remember is that you always haveto double check the solutions that youfind to the equation when you're dealingwith radical equations this is not anoptional thing you have to do it and thereason is because whatever potentialsolutions you find to the radicalequation may not actually satisfy theoriginal equation so you always have todouble check to make sure that yoursolution or solutions are truly valid soin this first example we have the squareroot of x minus 2 and then outside thesquare root we have minus 6 is equal to0 so we know this is an equation becausewe have an equal sign we know it's aradical equation because we have aradical or a square root involved so ourprocess is going to be to try to isolatethe square root by itself in order to dothat we'll have to add 6 to both sidesof our equation so that we can cancelthe negative 6 and the positive 6 on theleft when we do that that'll leave uswith just X minus 2 or square root of xminus 2 is equal to 0 plus 6 or 6 on theright because we get these two to cancelso now we've isolated our square rootand once we have our square rootisolated we want to go ahead and squareboth sides of the equation rememberwhatever you do to one side of theequation you have to do to the other inorder to keep the equation balanced andas we said before when we square asquare root those two things cancelleaving us with just whatever's insidethe square root in this case X minus 2on the right hand side we get 6 squaredor 6 times 6 that's 36 and now to solvefor x we just go ahead and add 2 to bothsides of the equation we get negative 2and positive 2 to cancel on the leftleaving us with just X is equal to 38 sonow this is our potential solution tothe equation but in order to verify thatit's an actual solution we must plugthis back into the original equation tomake sure that the equation is true soplugging x equals 38 back into ouroriginal equationwe get the square root of 38 minus 2minus 6 equals 0 we get the square rootof 36 minus 6 equals 0 the square rootof 36 is 6 so we get 6 minus 6 equals 0or 0 equals 0 so this checks out that'strue which means that x equals 38 is infact a valid solution to our radicalequation let's look at a second examplehere we have the square root of x plus 6plus x equals 0 just as before our goalis going to be to isolate the squareroot on its own side of the equation inorder to do that we'll have to subtractX from both sides of the equation thatwill get positive x and negative x tocancel leaving us with the square rootof x plus 6 is equal to negative x nowthat we have the square root I salute iton its own we can go ahead and squareboth sides of the equation like thiswhen we square a square root we getthose two things to cancel leaving uswith just what's inside of our squareroot so we get X plus 6 is equal to andnow we have negative x times negative xso be careful with your negative signshere remember that this is two factorsof negative x or just negative x timesnegative x like this when we multiplytwo negatives together they cancel tobecome a positive so we just have xtimes X or x squared so we get x squaredhere and now what we need to do is getall of our nonzero terms on one side andget this equation equal to 0 so the waythat we'll do that we want to keep our xsquared term positive whenever we canwe're going to subtract X and subtract 6from both sides so minus X and minus 6so that we get positive x and negative xto cancel and positive 6 and negative 6to cancel that's going to leave us withjust 0 on the left and on the rightwe'll get x squared minus X minus 6 nowwe have just a standard trinomial thatwe can factor so we're going to say 0 isequal to X minus 3 times X plus 2 and ifwe want to double check to make surethat we factor this correctly we can sayx times X gives us x squared plus 2x anda minus 3x gives us a minus 1 X or minusX so that's right and then a negative 3times a positive 2 is a negative 6 so weget back to negativesix so we factored correctly thistrinomial above and now we can use thezero theorem to solve for X rememberthat the zero theorem tells us that if Ptimes Q is equal to zero then either Pis equal to zero and or Q is equal tozero and the reason that we know thatthat's true of course is because if Ptimes Q is equal to zero then in orderto make this equation trueeither P must be equal to zero so thatyou get zero Q equals zero or just zeroequals zero or Q equals zero where youget zero P equals zero or just zeroequals zero so the only way thisequation is true is if P equals zero orQ equals zero well if we compare thiszero theorem formula to our equationwhat we're saying is that P is basicallythis factor here of X minus 3 and that Qis this factor here of X plus 2 so ourequation is really P times Q equals 0just like our zero theorem formula sowhat that tells us is that the solutionsthen are each of these factors set equalto 0 individually so we can set x minus3 equal to 0 and we can set x plus 2equal to 0 solving both of these we'llget X is equal to positive 3 when we add3 to both sides and subtracting 2 fromboth sides over here we get X is equalto negative 2 these are now thepotential solutions to the originalequation but remember we always have toplug them back into the originalequation to make sure that they'reactual solutions so let's start with xequals 3 and plug that back into ouroriginal equation we're going to get thesquare root of 3 plus 6 plus 3 is equalto 0 3 plus 6 is equal to 9 so we getthe square root of 9 plus 3 equals 0 thesquare root of 9 is 3 so 3 plus 3 equals0 6 equals 0 and that is not true 6 doesnot equal 0 which means that x equals 3is not an actual solution to the radicalequation let's try x equals negative 2here we're going to get the square rootof negative 2 plus 6 and then we getplus negative 2 or just minus 2 equals 0negative 2 plus 6 is the same as 6 minus2 so that's 4 so the square root of 4minus 2 equals 0for is 2 so we get 2 minus 2 equals 0 or0 equals 0 that does check out whichmeans that x equals negative 2 is infact a real solution to our radicalequation so that's a perfectillustration of why you always alwaysalways must check your answers back intothe original equation because thesolutions you find here are not alwaysgoing to satisfy the original equationand in this case x equals 3 looked likeit was a potential solution but didn'tturn out to be an actual solution and xequals negative 2 was the only solutionto this radical equation
