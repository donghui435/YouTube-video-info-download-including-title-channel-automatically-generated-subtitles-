so here we're going to find the area ofa rectangle and the formula that we useto find the area of a rectangle is a isequal to the base times the height and astands for the area the B stands for thebase and the H stands for the height andthe base is equal to the length of thebottom or the top of the rectangle sincethe bottom and the top have the samelength and the height is equal to thelength of the side of a rectangle andsince both sides have the same lengththe height is equal to the length ofeither side of the rectangle so let'sget started right away with an exampleso here we have a rectangle with abottom side with the length of 4 incheswhich also means that our top side haslength of 4 inches and the length of theside of our rectangle is 3 inches whichalso means that the other side of therectangle is also 3 inches and the baseis equal to the length of the bottom orthe top of the rectangle since thebottom has a length of 4 inches then ourbase is going to be equal to 4 inchesand the height is equal to the length ofthe side of the rectanglesince the side of a rectangle has alength of 3 inches our height is goingto be equal to 3 inches and now after wehave our base in our height we can justplug everything into our area formulathe area is equal to the base and weknow that the base of our rectangle is 4inches so I'm going to plug in 4 inchesfor our base and this is all multipliedby our height and we know that ourheight is equal to 3 inches so I'm goingto plug in 3 inches for the height andnow the only thing that we have to do ismultiply 4 times 3 is equal to 12 and wecan't forget about our units area isalways Expressin square units such as square feet orsquare meters or square yards since wewere given inches in this particularproblem our units are going to be squareinches and now I want to show you anillustration just so this makes a littlebit more sense what I want to do is I'mgoing to divide this base which has alength of 4 inches I'm going to divideit into four equal intervals of one inchand now I'm going to do the exact samething for the height since the heighthas a length of three inches I'm goingto divide the height into three equalone inch intervals so now you can seethat we have a bunch of squares with thebase and a height of one inch so thearea of each square is one square inchand look how many square inches we havewe have one square inch we have twosquare inches we have three four fivesix seven eight nine 10 11 and 12 squareinches so this is just a littleillustration to show that the area isequal to 12 square edges
