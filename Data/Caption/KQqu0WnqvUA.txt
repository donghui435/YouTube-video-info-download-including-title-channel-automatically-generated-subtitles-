well welcome in this video we're goingto be completing the second half oflesson 11 for if you recall from thefirst half of the lesson what we weredoing is we're taking an equation instandard form getting it down tofactored form and then using thosefactors to find the zeros of the rootsof the polynomial in this lesson we'regonna work our way backwards what we'regonna do is we're gonna start out withthe factored form and then expand it outinto the standard form of the polynomialso you can see what the originalequation would have been that would havebeen graph that would give us thosezeros or those roots of that polynomialagain in standard form so this is goingto require a little bit more work alittle bit more algebra and somemultiplying of some polynomials togetherso you want to make sure that you havesome patience with this but it's reallynot that difficult so with that let's goahead and just jump into things bylooking at these examples here so inthese examples we're gonna be looking atwriting a polynomial when we know thezeros before we look at this examplethough it's really important that weremember from the factor theorem that Xminus R is a factor of the polynomial aslong as R is a zero so when they give usthese zeros negative 2 3 & 4 we canwrite the factors as X minus each ofthose zeros now remember minus anegative becomes a positive so when I dothis first one X minus negative 2becomes X plus 2 so that's one of thefactors the polynomial again because ofusing the factor theorem X minus 3 wouldalso be a factor of the polynomial aswell as X minus 4 because if we were toset each of those factors equal to zerowe'd end up getting our zeros ofnegative 2 3 & 4 so our goal is to getour equation to be in standard form sowe're gonna go and multiply thesetogether now you can use any method youchoose personally I like just using thisbox method not the X Box method the boxmethod where we create our boxand then we're gonna set these factorsnow it doesn't matter which two Imultiply first if I want to put the Xplus 2 and X minus 3 if I want to dothat first I could but we put thosefactors on the outside of the box andwe're gonna multiply these together toget it in standard form now we're gonnahave to do this in a couple of parts soagain we can't multiply all three ofthese at once but I mean there is a waywe could but it gets really complicatedI think it's I think it's easy if we dothis in two separate parts so let'sstart by multiplying these together sowhen you multiply x times X we get xsquared x times 2 would be a positive 2X negative 3 times X is negative 3 Xnegative 3 times 2 is negative 6 so Imultiply just these first two I end upgetting x squared now negative 3x plus2x is negative 1x or just minus X minus6 now I still have to multiply thattimes the X minus 4 so now I'm gonnacreate a box that's a 2 by 3 grid and onthe side that's got the 2 I'm going toput the two terms X minus 4 on the sidewhere we have three columns I'm gonnahave the x squared minus X minus 6 nowwhen we multiply these together we get Xcubed this would be minus x squared andthen this would be minus 6 X then minus4 x squared this would be a plus 4 X andthis would be a positive 24 so now whenI combine like terms we get our finalanswer in standard form it'll be X cubedthere's no other X cube so that staysthe same the minus 4x squared a minus xsquared though those combine to be minus5 x squared and then the negative 6 Xplus 4 X is negative 2x and then we havethe plus 24 so equation you can saywould be y equalsX cubed minus 5x squared minus 2x plus24 and that's it so again you start thekey here is you start by just puttingthe zeros in a factored form and thenfrom factored form multiply piecestogether to get your answer in standardform let's start by looking at the nextone together and then I'll have youmultiply it together on your own buthere we have one of the zeros is justzero well if I put it in factored form Xminus 0 is just X then we would have Xplus 5 and then we would have X minus 6so you can multiply this in any orderthat you want if you want to multiplythese two binomials together first youcan you can distribute the X the firstbinomial and then multiply those twotogether it doesn't matter to mepersonally you might want to justmultiply the two binomials together Idon't know whatever you choose so whydon't you pause the video and hit playwhen you're ready to check to see if youhave the correct answer okay so let'ssee how you did here so what I ended updoing is I ended up multiplying the twobinomials together the X plus 5 times Xminus 6 again if you had distributed theX through you only want to do it to justfirst binomial just the X plus 5 don'tdo it to both binomials otherwise youend up with the wrong answer so when youmultiply these together we end upgetting x squared positive 5x and get anegative 6 X and a negative 30 so wecombine like terms we get x squaredminus X minus 30 but don't forget wehave to multiply everything by X now andwhen you do that you get your polynomialof y equals x cubed minus x squaredminus 30x so hopefully you got that asyour answer nowtimes instead of having the zeros givento us they're going to instead give us agraph or maybe we have to graph theequation or a calculator to find thex-intercepts either way we have to lookat the graph and see where does it crossthe x-axis at because those are thesezeros what are the zeros the roots thex-intercepts are all referring to thesame thing so let's start there so thezeros again are the x-intercepts so wehave zeros of negative 6 negative 2negative 1 and positive 2 so next wewant to put it in factored form so infactored form we're going to use thatfactor theorem so the X minus negative 6becomes x plus 6 X minus negative 2becomes X plus 2 and we'd have X minusnegative 1 becomes X plus 1 and thenfinally we would have X minus 2 now whenwe multiply these together we couldeither do it just from left to right ifyou wanted to personally I would groupthis up into pairs first so maybemultiply the first two in the last twoor what I notice with this one is thatthese two are conjugates of each otherand if you remember that when wemultiply two conjugates somethingsignificant happens let's look at whathappens if you forgot so again you wantto do it set up your box now if youremember what happens you can go aheadand jump to the shortcut but if you'vegot what happens you want to follow onnow again this is special because theseare unique these are conjugates of eachother X plus 2 and X minus 2 so when wemultiply these we get x squared thiswill be 2 X this will be negative 2 Xand then we get negative 4 and if younotice 2x minus 2x is 0 so we multiplythese two together we just get x squaredminus 4 now you still want to multiplybecause we still have this X plus 6 andX plus 1we're still gonna multiply thosetogether so let's actually do that nextso we're gonna take I'll do that downhere I'm gonna multiply these togethernow so we'll take the X plus 6 put thaton the outside of the box and the X plus2 want to put that on the outside of thebox oh by the way for going back to theconjugates so if you didn't recognizethis the shortcut was if you multiplyjust the first terms and the last term'syou get your answer x times X is xsquared 2 times negative 2 is negative 4but that only works because they'reconjugates these are not conjugates sowe have to multiply it this way and whenwe do that we get x squared this will be6x to be a positive 1 X and then wewould get 6 so when we combine liketerms don't forget about that x squaredminus 4 we have to multiply by that butwhen we combine like terms we get xsquared 6x and X together makes 7 x andthen plus 6 so we are still not finishedyet now we have to multiply these twotogether so we're gonna multiply theseby setting up a 2 by 3 grid so I'm gonnaput the x squared minus 4 out here the xsquared plus 7x plus 6 I put that hereand when we multiply these together weget X to the fourth so be 7x cubed andthis will be 6x squared this is negative4x squared negative 28 X and negative 24so now when I combine like terms I getmy final answer of y equals x to thefourth now you got to be careful we'recombining like terms some of you mightbe in the habit of thinking all thediagonals are always like terms theseare not there's no other X cube so thatstays a 7 X cubed thissix x squared and minus four x squaredthose are like terms so together thatmakes two x squared and then the - 28 Xdoesn't have any other like terms andneither does the 24 so this would beyour final answer so again kind of along process nothing really thatdifficult about it though so why don'tyou guys take a couple of minutes I wantyou guys work on this one on your own soyou hear you have to count to see whereyour x-intercepts are it's a little biteasier by the way assume that this ishitting this x-axis at this point it'skind of hard to see that but we're gonnaassume that these are all integer valuesfor X intercepts so I want you guys goahead and do that figure out what thesefour X intercepts are gonna be and thenuse that to find the factored form andthen write your answer in standard formso pause the video and hit play whenyou're ready to check to see if you havethe correct answer okay so let's see howyou did here so your first step is wewant to find the zeros for this bylooking at those x-intercepts sohopefully you looked at that correctlybecause I could have thrown off yourentire answer just by getting thosewrong but our zeros would be negative 90 8 and 15 so in factored form youshould have had now the 0 of 0 wouldjust be X minus 0 which we could justput as X out in front if you had it inthe middle it doesn't matter but if thisis to be though this would be the bestway to write it and then you could havethe X plus 9 the X minus 8 and the Xminus 15 again in any order so now whatI did is I'm going to multiply thesetogether in two parts and then multiplythose what we get is these two parts toget our final answer so the x times Xplus 9 it just gives me x squared plus 9X now the other part I'm going to doover here and we end up getting on theoutside of our box you put these piecesso we get x squared minus 8x minus 15 Xplus 120 combine like terms and we get xsquared minus 23 X plus 120 now we'regoing to multiply these together so I'mgoing to set up a two by three gridlet's buy those we get X to the fourthminus 23 X cubed plus 1 xx x squared nowsome ones are gonna get rather largehere we get 9x cubed and then negative207 x squared and then plus 1080 Xcombine like terms we get our answer yequals x to the fourth minus 14 X cubedminus 87 x squared plus 1080 X wellthere you have itthat is lesson 11 more 11 for completednow so remember the first part of thelessonwe took an equation in standard form gotit to be in factored form to find thezeros in this part of the lesson theygave us the zeros we got it in factoredform and then we rewrote it to be instandard form so good luck now as youwork on your assignment
