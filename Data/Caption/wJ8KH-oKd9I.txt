let's look at some multiplication ofdecimals what you have when you aremultiplying by decimals is you no longerhave to line up the decimals like youdid when you were doing um addition andsubtraction but you do have to line upthe numbers as if the decimals weren'tthere so I would look at the point zerosix or six hundred multiplied by thefive tenths okay notice that I'm liningup the numbers on the right side when Igo to multiply I'm going to bemultiplying the six times five which isthirty but now I have to account for thedecimal points noticing right here Ihave two numbers behind the decimalthere here I have one number behind thedecimal and when I add up the two andthe three a two and the one I get threedigits behind the decimal that means inmy answer I'm going to have to have onetwo three numbers behind the decimalalso noticing here I have 30 thousandthsand I can always take off the zero onthe end which would leave me threehundredths for my answer another exampleI have for M two tenths times 12 whatI'm going to do is line up and sincethey both have two digits it really doesnot matter which ones on the top andwhich ones on the bottom I'm just gonnado them in order and twelve nowremembering I have to count the numberof digits behind the decimalobviously Ione in this problemwhere's the decimal under 12 againremember the periods at the end of thisis the decimal is at the end of thenumber which means I have zero herewhich means my answer is going to have atotal of one number behind the decimalpoint so what I thought is I can goahead and just start multiplying 2 times2 is 4 2 2 4 is 8remember to count over 2 times 1 is 2 1times 4 is 4 add up I got 10 carry 1gives me 5 and remember I've got to haveone number behind the decimal point somy answer is 50 and 4/10 Wowlooking at these numbers they can be alittle bit intimidating but rememberwe're gonna line up the numbers on theright so I'm gonna get out of point zerosix two five which is 625 10 thousandstimes my 56 hundreds okaylooking at my decimals I have one twothree four numbers behind the decimalthere I have two decimal or numbers downthe decimal here which will give me atotal of six numbers behind the decimalin my answer so going ahead andmultiplying it I got 5 times 6 is 30carry my 3 12 plus 3 is 15 carry one and36 plus 1 is 37 I'm gonna take away mycarrying ya and started yet byremembering move over 1 5 times 5 is 25ten plus two is twelve carry one andthirty plus 1 is 31 now adding them up0:10 carry 110 carry 1 5 don't carry and3 remembering I have 6 numbers behindthe decimal so there's 1 2 3 4 5 and yesyou must have a 0 to the front and againremembering any 0 on the end I can takeoffso my answer yes 35 thousandths one trapyou have to watch out when you'redividing or multiplying decimals is whenyou add and subtract you get so used tojust dropping it down and if you havethe same number of decimals in both ofthem you have two here and two hereremember you've got to add these up togive you a total of 4 in their answer sodoing this problem you've got the 1times 2 1 times 1 count over 1 times 2 1times 1 you've got 1 3 1 and it's soeasy to drop it down but notice if youdrop it down you won't have the rightnumber of decimalsyou've got the 1 2 3 and add your zeroin the front so be careful that youdon't fall into that add and subtract
