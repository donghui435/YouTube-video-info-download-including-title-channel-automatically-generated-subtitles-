I just want to show you lastly here wego how to make sure you can find how tomake sure you can find each of theseunderstandably fought because so far Ithink you've mostly been seeing it giveit two in a table or in a list butyou've got to be careful with Donna likethis you've got to make sure you read itproperly okay so we'll do them one at atime how do you find the mean here areall your scores now that you canactually read them how are we going tofind them in here what kind ofinformation you look on the side um whatinformation I gonna need okay good soI'm going to need to add up some schoollet's do them with me right what are thescores aren't adding up this is the moonthat we calculate in there 51 52 etcokay let's get them all down 51 50 to 6062 65 okay good someone can be addingthese up by the way don't forget this gohappens twice so you include it twiceright 75 and 75 what's next 86 87 andokay cool so you're going to get anumber and all that okay so you've doneboth having you you've added them up andthen what did you / 12 okay good so youcounted out there are 12 scores and thatgives you can you repeat the numberagain 79 15 yeah that's cool all rightdoes it seem like a reasonabledescription of the center of this groupyeah i think so i think it does andyou'll notice the reason why you canbecause look at it sideways this is apretty normal sort of set of data rightit's not like it's skee ball boiler yogaso that's all right the mode that'spretty actually no more up to a millionsorry the median that is two ways to dothis okay we'll find out whether it's 71in a second what's what's a quick waythat I could find out where the middlescore is yeahokay good so I could I could cross offscore so I can go there's one bottom andwhat a top bottom what you don't do usany water okay sure you guys anything ordon't like what if you put 70 you startfrom the final morning ah so I'm so gladyou asked that remember i showed youthis before right let's put some morescores on the NCR okay you kind of dizzyyou kind of have to count from bothdirections right because you want tomake sure you meet in the middle soyou'd say one at the bottom one at thetop one bottom one at the top and thenyou that I've got two left in the middleand that's why we took the average okayso you can see I'm counting both wayscutting both ways sir so far I went 123from the bottom this is the smallestnumber I went 123 from top is thebiggest numbers let's keep going bottomtop this is counting down I bottom toplike I have a look okay so it's going tobe between 71 and 74 so the median isokay now I'll just point out this waskind of reasonable like this wholecrossing off thing there are other 12scores right how would we do if thereare like 120 scores this would beforever okay is there a quicker way thatdoesn't require me to cross everythingoffwhat if I heard there is right he is theidea of the middle I said it was likesort of okay as a definition this isbetter but if I told you how many scoresthey were for instance if I said thereare a hundred scores you can tell mewhether little bit country which scoreshould it be yeah I need to say wellit's going to be around the 50th rightit's going to be around the 15 now toknow exactly let's think about a simpleone so if I have one two three four andfive you guys can all tell me it's sillywhich one the central one is right themedian it's clearly going to be threeokay what if I said I money aspect123456789 again instantly you can tellme it's fine right so how can we ratherthan just counting and looking at it howcan we go straight to three or five soyou just like just like / choosing inthe position of the number yeah verygood no what I point out it's a bitunusual right here's a bit of a trickyyou may want to drop this down whereyou've got comedian written down i'llget to recover the shortcut rather thancounting your way there right which isquite inefficient the shortcut is to sayif you've got n terms like like fiveterms or so scores or nine scores rightwhat you say is with that number in youadd one and you divide that by two whathow it works you've got five scores hereso I'm going to add one which gives mesix and then divide by two excuse me ohhow about this one the number of courseis 9 so I'm going to add one which givesme 10 and i divided by two which is mefive that's a that's a good questionboth of these you've noticed are oddnumbers right so there's a middle butthis one how many scores are Bentleythere are six scores so if I did thisprocess again right if i took that nowbut added one and divided by 2 this is 3a half what does that meanit's between the third and fourth termsyou can have to take the average rightdoes that make sense so this is a muchquicker way of doing things and that'swhy you should write it in from a bigbox around because if you have anydecent sized set of scores then can t goto take you forever okay find out howmany terms there are you need to knowthat I like your average or what haveyou add 1 and then advise the wholenumbers by two and then Tyler anywayyeah it works all the time or when youon the median directly or it will tellyou you should be halfway between thisone in that one okay I came to finishmodes easiest what's the mascot let's go75 okay fantastic so you can see it'sthe only one the tumbles up I will pointout and you maybe want to write thisunderneath where you've said mode it'sthe only one out of these three measuresthat you can have multiple ones right iffor instance I was the hijacker data andput in another 52 there's no reason whyyou can't save 75 and 52 they're boththe mode I recalled by middle and Icould say I could put in another one nomother 6552 and 65 and 75 they'realready removed okay so if for instanceeveryone in the class going differentscore on your doom then everyone's markwould be the moon it's not very usefulin that case
