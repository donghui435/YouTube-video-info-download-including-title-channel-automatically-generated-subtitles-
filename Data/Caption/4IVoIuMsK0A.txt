welcome let me talk about an issue thatactually drives me nuts as an algebrateacher for kids so many curriculum wantkids to memorize formulas and plug andchug when answering questions and inquadratics that topic is full of justmemorization of example an algebra mightask the student to examine the equationx squared minus 2x plus 2 and they mightask something like how many times isthis quadratic across the x-axis nowkids are meant to know the quadraticformula x equals negative B plus minussquare root of b squared minus 4ac allover 2a and they mention though thatthis quantity under the square root signis interesting because basically ifthat's a positive number then I canreally can take that square root andI'll get two solutions with thisquantity I guess they call thediscriminant is zero then there's onlyone square root so is the only number ofone square root which gives only onesolution and if this quantity happens tobe negative forget trying to take squareroots no solutions so basically and nowto book my head kids answer thisquestion how many times does cross thex-axis they're asking them to have theymemorize the form of discriminant andthen go check whether it's positivenegative or zero well when I teachalgebra yes I do derive the quadraticformula but that's just for interestssake we do not memorize it my kids willnever know why mean because they know itbut i'll never ask them to memorize bsquared minus 4ac I much rather test dothey understand quadratics rather thantesting have they memorized formulas sohow are my kids ask this question howmany times is x squared minus 2x plus tocross the x-axis well pictures picturesspeak a thousand word let's just drawthis thing and that's pretty easy andI'd like to focus on interestingx-values let me just focus on the X partof this equation and clearly I cansecond factor out an X from most apartso it's x times X minus 2 still with theplus 2 well this tells me just lookingat this x equals 0 and x equals 2 areboth interesting so at 0 somethinginterest is going on to somethinginteresting is going on or put an xequals 0 this former gets 0 plus 2 sothe graph is too high put an x equals 2into this former i get 0 plus 2 so I'vegot now too symmetrical pointsgical graph so it's a u-shaped graphit's symmetrical and maybe it's likethis or maybe it dips down below thex-axis of course on it or maybe justtouch it sooo nice but I can see fromthe picture that x equals 1 is where allthe actions going on because everythingsymmetrical so let me plug in x equals 1to the original formula i get the y at xequals 1 is 1 minus 2 plus 2 which isonce actually at 1091 hi so my graphmust actually be like this and juststaring at the picture how many timesacross the x-axis 0 times yes I do admitb squared minus 4ac is quicker but i'mnot interested in speed and much ratheri'm more interested in understandinglet's try another one maybe that makesme a weird algebra teacher here goeslet's try y equals negative 3x squaredplus 12x plus 5 how many times does thatcross the x-axis all right I'm going tofocus on interesting x values can I pullsome out we add let's focus on the Xpart I see a negative 3x in common whichleaves an X behind and a minus 4 that'sanother plus five right there that tellsme x equals 0 and x equals 4 interestingin fact if I put in 0 and for both ofthis big term goes to 0 plus 5 so hasvalue 5 at each of those two points tosymmetrical points on a symmetricalgraph that's actually a downward-facingknew that negative 3 tells me things aredownward tells me okay without anyfurther ado then must cross the x-axistwice so many times it across there's xaxis 2 times that picture speaks athousand words well towards two timesalgebra books like to really test cankids handle this by sort of beginnergiving more interesting questions aninteresting such a subjective term yequals 4x squared plus 8x plus K maybethe question now is find a value K sothat this graph just touches the x-axiswell i'm just going to sketch the thingagain pictures speak a thousand wordsi'm gonna look for interesting x valueslet's focus on the X part of thisequation anything I can do oh I see acommon factor of fourx is pull it for X and the store plus Khanging around this tells me x equals 0and x equals negative 2 are bothinteresting so here's negative 2 andhere 0 if at if I put in 0 to thisformula or put negative 2 I get thispart of 0 plus k now i'm not sure wherethe k is but i'll have two symmetricalpoints k hi now this 4x squared tells meis an upward facing u-shaped grassthat's going to be something like thiscoming upward and the question was firedby DK so it just touches the x-axis thattells me I want to come down and justtouch the XX like that well everythingsymmetrical I know all the action isgoing to happen at negative 1 so Ireally want in this picture is a valueof K so that when I put a negative 10comes out alright let's put x equalsnegative 1 0 for y and see what it tellsus so 0 would have to equal 4 timesnegative 1 squared plus 8 times negative1 plus K so 0 equals 4 minus 8 plus Kthat tells me k equals 4 does the tricklet me do a fourth example i guess icould example of a form another type ofquestion which i haven't really seen analgebra books but its its testingunderstanding or more than doing yequals negative 2x squared groups plus8x plus loops x plus k scrawly writingi'm so sorry find a value X so thatnegative 2x squared plus 8x plus K haslargest value 43 all right this time Iwanna grab as largest value 43 choose avalue of K to make that happen alrightwell draw a picture and good wave startdrawing pictures focus on interesting xvalues let's focus on the X part I'msitting pulled out there may be anegative 2x that leaves behind an X anda negative 4 and stuff plus K so rightnow I see that x equals 0 and x equals 4interesting dr. to seeand for if I put in 0 and for this termis 0 plus K each of these has value Kmaybe it's higher maybe it's loyalmembers an excellent question where itis but but but but but I know that I'mgonna have a downward facing newgraph at negative to tell us when thestick this is negative so I've got somegraph like this might be higher or lowerthan this and I got sure but all theaction is happening at two becauseeverything is symmetrical so basically Iwant a value of K is that this peak ishappening at 43 that means the graph haslargest value 43 so basically it tellsme when I put an x equals 2 I want Y tobe 43 let's plug that into the equationsee what happens why is 43 should equalputting in x equals to negative 8 plus16 plus K that tells me a k minus 80 kplus 8 sorry is a 43 that tells me kbetter be 35 you know you don't needformulas just do common sense thingsdraw picture pictures reveals so muchmore than formulas and once you've got apicture just use your brain just useyour common sense and sort of nuts yourway through these questions andeverything falls into place I muchrather have my students demonstrateintelligent thinking rather thanplugging and chugging into formulas Iguess have an opinion about this allright thanks so much
