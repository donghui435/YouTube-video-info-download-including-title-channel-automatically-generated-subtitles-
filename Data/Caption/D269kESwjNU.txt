the equivalent expressions equivalentexpressions hahahapretty much we can represent equivalentexpressions by using one of these littlesigns that kind of looks like littlerailroad tracks which we call an equalsign and when dealing with thisequivalent expressions pretty much meanthat this side equals that side meaningthat two expressions algebraic or youknow numeric are gonna have exactly thesame value so let's take a look at acouple equivalent expressions sevenequals sevenso therefore I can say that value on theleft side of the equal sign is equal tothe value of on the expression on theright side which is seven equals sevenfair enough right a lot of times weactually looked at this I can do threetimes four is equal to four times threeright this is when we use thecommutative property we said that threetimes four was equal to four times threethe values on the left and right sideare equal to each otherwhat else have we talked about so far wesaid a plus zero was equal to a where arepresented any real value or any realnumber but since they're a they have tobe exactly the same so we said that aplus zero equals eight now I know theydon't look like the same but what wetalked about was the value of both sidesof this equation are exactly the sametherefore they are equivalentexpressions so you know a lot of timeswhen we're talking about equivalentexpressions it's just a way to say thatyou know the left side is equal to theright side and they don't always have tolook alike right so one thing that youknow will start when we start lookinginto equations we could say that aequals nine this is an expressionmeaning the value of a is equal to nineso this side equals this side well ifthis side equals this side then what isthe valueI have to be well the value of a has tobe nine right therefore we can say a isequal to nine or the same value as nineso there's just a quick littledemonstration of the equivalentexpressions
