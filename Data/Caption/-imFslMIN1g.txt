so welcome to my video on changing animproper fraction into a mixed number sohere we have the improper fraction 9over 4 it's improper because we have anumerator of 9 which is bigger than ourdenominator and we want to change itinto a mixed number and this is donethrough long division so what I'm goingto do is since 9 is being divided by 4I'm going to use long division anddivide 9 by 4 so now I have to see howmany times 4 goes into 9 we know 4 goesinto 9 at least 2 times and if youmultiply 2 times 4 2 times 4 is 8 and ifwe subtract 9 minus 8 we get a remainderof 1 so since 4 goes into 9 2 times ourmixed number is going to have a wholenumber of two and since we have a 1 leftover and our remainder our mixed numberis going to have a 1 in the numeratorand our denominator always stays thesame since we have a 4 denominator inour fraction or could also have a 4denominator in our mixed number so 9over 4 is equal to 2 and 1/4 and I wantto show you an illustration so thismakes a little bit more sense since wehave a whole number of two I'm going todraw two whole pies and since we'redealing with fourths and we have 1/4 inour denominator we're going to dividethese pies into fourths and since wealso have a fraction of 1/4 I'm going todraw an extra 1/4 piece of the pie solet's count how many 4 for the pies wehave total we have 1/4 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9we have nine fourths of the pie or 9over 4so hopefully you can see that nine forceof the pie is exactly equal to two wholepies plus 1/4 so hopefully this makesmore sense how an improper fraction of 9over 4 is exactly equal to a mixednumber of 2 and 1/4 so here are somemore videos with some more exampleproblems related to the video you justwatchedI really hope you're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you later
