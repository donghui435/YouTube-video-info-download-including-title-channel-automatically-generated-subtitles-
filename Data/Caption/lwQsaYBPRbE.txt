ok today we're going to be taking a lookat how you go about finding the inversefunction all right now I have alreadylined out some steps for you to followall right the first thing you're goingto do is you're going to change your fof X to a Y step number two you're goingto then switch the X and the y thenyou're going to push step 3 solve theequation that you have for y and thenyour final step then would just be torewrite into function notation ok sowe're going to implement those foursteps on the given function I have afunction here f of x equals 7 over Xminus 3 all right step one it says tochange f of X to Y so that's what I'mgonna do right here I am going to changethat to a why I'm just going to replaceit so y equals 7 over X minus 3 okaystep two says to switch the X and the yso the Y is on the left the X is on theright all I am going to do is justliterally switch those two variablesaround so I will have an X on this sideequals 7 over y minus 3 all right now Ihave to go through I now have a newequation step three takes a little bitof effort because it NASA is solved fory so I'm going to go through thisequation I'm going to attempt to solvefor y all right first thing I want to dois isolate the 3 get the 3 over to theother side it says minus 3 doing theopposite of that would be adding 3 overthere and then adding 3 on the left handside as well the 3 is on the right handside are going to cross out when Ichoose to write the next line here Iwant to clean this up a little bit I'mgoing to go X plus 3 equals 7 over Yalright now I'm still trying to solvefor y I need to do the opposite of whatI see over here I've got 7 divided by Yalright the opposite of dividing by Ywould be multiplying by Y I'm gonna goahead and do that because I think it'sgoing to be a simpler approach here if Imultiply both sides by Y even though Iam trying to solve for yit's gonna happen is I'm going toeliminate this fraction so bymultiplying by y I can cross out the Y'son the right hand side and in essencethat has just then moved it over on theleft hand side alright I am gonna cleanit up rewrite the equation y parenthesisx plus 3 parenthesis equals 7 ok now Iam still trying to solve for y I want toisolate y and get it on one side byitself this is a binomial I've got a setof parentheses around that because whenI multiply both sides by Y in theprevious step I had to multiply it bythe entire quantity which turned out tobe a binomial so now I can divide bothsides because right there Y times thatbinomial I want to isolate my Y so I'mgonna divide by X plus 3 I'm gonnadivide by X plus 3 on the right handside left hand side those two binomialsare gonna cross out which is what wewant cleaning this up a little bit I'mgonna have y equals 7 over X plus 3 so Ihave now successfully solved thisequation for y fourth step says torewrite into function notation so I havefound this function right here that Ihave found is the inverse of my originalfunction my original function was calledf of X so when I rewrite in the functionnotation I need to indicate that it isthe inverse so the inverse of F is equalto 7 over X plus 3 and there you havefinding the inverse of a function
