so welcome to my video on the law ofcosines in my previous video I explainedto you how to solve a triangle using thelaw of sines and that's probably thefirst method that you should use tosolve a triangle however there's someparticular cases when you can't solve atriangle using the law of sines and youneed to use the law of cosines so I'mgoing to explain to you when you need touse the law of cosines and in how we useit so one case when we need to use thelaw of cosines is if they give us twosides let's say they give a side a and Cand they also give us the angle inbetween those two sides and notice howangle B is in between the two sides thatare given to us um so if that is thetype of triangle that's given to youthen you need to use the law of cosinesto solve the triangle and one more casewhere you have to use a lot of cosinesis if you're given all three sides ofthe triangle you're not given any anglesand you're just given all of the sidesof a triangle in this particular caseyou have to also use the law of cosinesto solve the triangle so that is mybrief introduction and let's get startedright away with an example all right solet's say we're given a triangle and weknow that the bottom side of thetriangle is equal to 12 units let's saythat we have another side of thetriangle and we know that it has adistance of 9 units and let's say thatwe know that this angle in between thosetwo sides let's say we know that thisangle is 50 degrees all right so like Isaid before we're given two sides and wealso know that the angle in betweenthose two sides is 50 degrees so forthis particular case when we're giventwo sides and the angle in between weknow that we need to use the law ofcosines all right so let's label ourtriangle let's say that this angle isangle alet's say that this angle is angle Bwe'll say that this angle is angle C andwe know that the side that opposite ofangle a has to be side a so we know thatthe side of a length nine is our side aand we know since our top angle is C weknow that the side that's opposite ofangle C which is the bottom side has tobe our side C so our side with length of12 is our side C and we know that theside that's opposite of angle B is equalto our side B which we don't know thelength of that side yet all right so nowthat we've labeled our triangle nowwe're ready to plug everything into ourlaw of cosines formula and I wrote allthe formulas on the right-hand side ofthe screen and all the formulas areexactly the same you can use any onethat you want based on how you labeledthe triangle because the way I label thetriangle we're missing side B I'm goingto use this formula that has a B on theleft-hand side because that's what we'retrying to solve for we're trying to findour B so I'm going to use our B formulabut everybody labels their triangledifferently you don't have to label itthe same exact way that I did so it'spossible that you could use any one ofthese these three formulas but all rightso let's plug everything in to theformula that that we know once againwe're going to use the second formularight here so that form that says that Bsquared is equal to a squared and weknow that our a is equal to 9 so insteadof a squared I'm going to put a 9squared plus C squared and we know thatour C squared is equal to 12 so insteadof C squared I'm going to put a 12squared minus 2 times a once again weknow that our a is equal to 9 times C weknow that our C is equal to 12 allmultiplied by the coastsine of the angle B and we know that ourangle B is equal to 50 degrees so I'mgoing to put the cosine of 50 degrees sonow that we've plugged everything inlet's try and simplify this a littlefurther so we know that B squared isequal to 9 squared which is 81 plus 12squared which is 144 and this is allbeing subtracted by 2 times 9 times 12times the cosine of 50 and if you plugthat into a calculator that is all goingto equal a hundred and thirty eightpoint eight four to one I rounded tofour decimal points because allintermediate steps I always round to tofour decimal points all right so let'ssimplify this even more we have Bsquared is equal to 81 plus 144 which isequal to 225 and this is beingsubtracted by 138 point eight four toone if you subtract to 225 minus 138point eight four to one we know that Bsquared is equal to 86 point one fiveseven nine so now we know the value of Bsquared but we need to find the value ofB we need to find a length of B so if weknow what B squared is it's quite easyto find B B is just going to be equal tothe square root of B squared so B isequal to the square root of 86 point onefive seven nine and you need to plugthat into your calculator and the squareroot of 86 point one five seven nine isequal to nine point three I rounded toone decimal point I always round myfinal answers to twoone decimal point so we know that ourside B has a distance of nine pointthree units and I'm not going to solvethe rest of this triangle for you justto save you a little bit of time I'm youdon't need to use the law of cosines tofinish solving this triangle that wouldtake you a lot a lot of extra time youcould actually use the law of sineswhich is a which is a bit quicker if youhaven't seen my law of sines video I'mgoing to make a link for you in thebottom right-hand part of the screen andI hope you enjoyed this and if you haveany extra questions leave a commentbelow and I will see you in my nextvideo
