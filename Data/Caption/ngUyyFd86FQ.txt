hi this is pressure Locker let's discussthe Monty Hall problem you're on a gameshow where you have the choice to pickdoor number one two or three behind twoof the doors is nothing and behind oneof the doors is a car you pick doornumber one the host who knows thelocation of the car shows you doornumber two is nothing do you stay ondoor number one or do you switch to doornumber three switching to door numberthree is actually the much better choicestatistically even though it seems likestaying and switching should not matterlet's do an experiment to illustrate whywe are going to randomize the locationof the car and we're going to imaginepicking one of the doors where the carisn't and deciding whether it's betterto stay on door number one or switch todoor numbers two or three whichever onewas not empty initially it seems likestaying or switching does not matter butas we do the experiment a hundred timeswe find that switching is a much betterstrategy almost two times better thanstaying the reason is that when you stayyou only win when the car was initiallybehind door number one when you switchyou will win if the car was behind doorsnumber two or three the Monty Hallproblem seems like a paradox because ofhow it stated imagine the host tells youlook you can stay on door number one andyou'll win only if the car is behindthat door or I'll allow you to switch towin on doors number two or three and bythe way when you switch I'll open one ofthose doors where the car is not behindnow it's obvious that switching allowsyou to win for two doorswhereas staying only allows you to winfor one door please subscribe to mychannel I make videos on math and gametheory you can support mind yourdecisions on patreon to get exclusiverewards you can also catch me on my blogmind your decisions on Twitter at preshtellWalker or get my books at Amazon
