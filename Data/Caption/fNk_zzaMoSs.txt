"The introduction of numbers as coordinates
is an act of violence."！Hermann WeylThe fundamental, root-of-it-all building block
for linear algebra is the vector, so it'sworthmaking sure that we're all on the same page
about what exactly a vector is.You see, broadlyspeaking there are three distinct but related
ideas about vectors, which I'll call the physicsstudent perspective, the computer science
student perspective, and the mathematician'sperspective.The physics student perspective is that vectors
are arrows pointing in space.What defines a givenvector is its length, and the direction it's
pointing in, but as long as those two factsare thesame, you can move it all around and it's
still the same vector.Vectors that live in the flat planeare two-dimensional, and those sitting in
broader space that you and I live in are three-dimensional.The computer science perspective is that vectors
are ordered lists of numbers.For example, let'ssay that you were doing some analytics about
house prices, and the only features you caredaboutwere square footage and price.You might model each house with a pair of
numbers: the firstindicating square footage, and the second
indicating price.Notice that the order matters here.In the lingo, you'd be modelling houses as
two-dimensional vectors, where in this context,"vector" is pretty much just a fancy word
for "list", and what makes it two-dimensionalis the factthat the length of that list is 2.The mathematician, on the other hand, seeks
to generalise both of these views, basicallysaying thata vector can be anything where there's a sensible
notion of adding two vectors, and multiplyingavector by a number, operations that I'll talk
about later on in this video.The details of this vieware rather abstract, and I actually think
it's healthy to ignore it until the last videoof thisseries, favoring a more concrete setting in
the interim,but the reason that I bring it up here is
that it hints at the fact that ideas of vectoradditionand multiplication by numbers will play an
important role throughout linear algebra.But before I talk about those operations,
let's just settle in on a specific thoughtto have in mindwhen I say the word "vector".Given the geometric focus that I'm shooting
for here, whenever Iintroduce a new topic involving vectors, I
want you to first think about an arrow！andspecifically,think about that arrow inside a coordinate
system, like the x-y plane, with its tailsitting at the origin.This is a little bit different from the physics
student perspective, where vectors can freelysitanywhere they want in space.In linear algebra, it's almost always the
case that your vector will berooted at the origin.Then, once you understand a new concept in
the context of arrows in space,we'll translate it over to the list-of-numbers
point-of-view, which we can do by consideringthe coordinates of the vector.Now while I'm sure that many of you are familiar
with this coordinate system, it's worth walkingthrough explicitly, since this is where all
of the important back-and-forth happens betweenthe twoperspectives of linear algebra.Focusing our attention on two dimensions for
the moment, you have ahorizontal line, called the x-axis, and a
vertical line, called the y-axis.The place where theyintersect is called the origin, which you
should think of as the center of space andthe root of all vectors.After choosing an arbitrary length to represent
1, you make tick-marks on each axis torepresent this distance.When I want to convey the idea of 2-D space
as a whole, which you'll seecomes up a lot in these videos, I'll extend
these tick-marks to make grid-lines, but rightnowthey'll actually get a little bit in the way.The coordinates of a vector is a pair of numbers
thatbasically give instructions for how to get
from the tail of that vector！at the origin！toits tip.The first number tells you how far to walk
along the x-axis！positive numbers indicatingrightwardmotion, negative numbers indicating leftward
motion！and the second number tell you howfar to walkparallel to the y-axis after that！positive
numbers indicating upward motion, and negativenumbersindicating downward motion.To distinguish vectors from points, the convention
is to write this pairof numbers vertically with square brackets
around them.Every pair of numbers gives you one and only
one vector, and every vector is associatedwith one andonly one pair of numbers.What about in three dimensions?Well, you add a third axis, called the z-axis,which is perpendicular to both the x- and
y-axes, and in this case each vector is associatedwith an ordered triplet of numbers: the first
tells you how far to move along the x-axis,the secondtells you how far to move parallel to the
y-axis, and the third one tells you how farto then moveparallel to this new z-axis.Every triplet of numbers gives you one unique
vector in space, andevery vector in space gives you exactly one
triplet of numbers.So back to vector addition, and multiplication
by numbers.After all, every topic in linear algebrais going to center around these two operations.Luckily, each one is pretty straightforward
to define.Let's say we have two vectors, one pointing
up, and a little to the right, and the otheronepointing right, and down a bit.To add these two vectors, move the second
one so that its tail sitsat the tip of the first one; then if you draw
a new vector from the tail of the first oneto wherethe tip of the second one now sits, that new
vector is their sum.This definition of addition, by the way, is
pretty much the only time in linear algebrawhere we letvectors stray away from the origin.Now why is this a reasonable thing to do?！Why
this definition of addition and not some otherone?Well the way I like to think about it is that
each vector represents a certain movement！astep witha certain distance and direction in space.If you take a step along the first vector,then take a step in the direction and distance
described by the second vector, the overalleffect isjust the same as if you moved along the sum
of those two vectors to start with.You could think about this as an extension
of how we think about adding numbers on anumber line.One way that we teach kids to think about
this, say with 2+5, is to think of moving2 steps to theright, followed by another 5 steps to the
right.The overall effect is the same as if you just
took7 steps to the right.In fact, let's see how vector addition looks
numerically.The first vectorhere has coordinates (1,2), and the second
one has coordinates (3,-1).When you take the vector sumusing this tip-to-tail method, you can think
of a four-step path from the origin to thetip of thesecond vector: "walk 1 to the right, then
2 up, then 3 to the right, then 1 down."Re-organisingthese steps so that you first do all of the
rightward motion, then do all of the verticalmotion,you can read it as saying, "first move 1+3
to the right, then move 2+(-1) up," so thenew vector hascoordinates 1+3 and 2+(-1).In general, vector addition in this list-of-numbers
conception lookslike matching up their terms, and adding each
one together.The other fundamental vector operation is
multiplication by a number.Now this is best understoodjust by looking at a few examples.If you take the number 2, and multiply it
by a given vector, itmeans you stretch out that vector so that
it's 2 times as long as when you started.If you multiplythat vector by, say, 1/3, it means you squish
it down so that it's 1/3 of the original length.When you multiply it by a negative number,
like -1.8, then the vector first gets flippedaround,then stretched out by that factor of 1.8.This process of stretching or squishing or
sometimes reversing the direction of a vectoris called "scaling",and whenever you catch a number like 2 or
1/3 or -1.8 acting like this！scaling somevector！you call it a "scalar".In fact, throughout linear algebra, one of
the main things thatnumbers do is scale vectors, so it's common
to use the word "scalar" pretty much interchangeablywith the word "number".Numerically, stretching out a vector by a
factor of, say, 2, corresponds tomultiplying each of its components by that
factor, 2, so in the conception of vectorsaslists of numbers, multiplying a given vector
by a scalar means multiplying each one ofthose components by that scalar.You'll see in the following videos what I
mean when I say that linear algebra topicstend to revolvearound these two fundamental operations: vector
addition, and scalar multiplication; and I'lltalkmore in the last video about how and why the
mathematician thinks only about these operations,independent and abstracted away from however
you choose to represent vectors.In truth, it doesn'tmatter whether you think about vectors as
fundamentally being arrows in space！likeI'm suggestingyou do！that happen to have a nice numerical
representation, or fundamentally as listsof numbersthat happen to have a nice geometric interpretation.The usefulness of linear algebra has less
to do witheither one of these views than it does with
the ability to translate back and forth betweenthem.It gives the data analyst a nice way to conceptualise
many lists of numbers in a visual way,which can seriously clarify patterns in data,
and give a global view of what certain operationsdo,and on the flip side, it gives people like
physicists and computer graphics programmersa languageto describe space and the manipulation of
space using numbers that can be crunched andrun through a computer.When I do math-y animations, for example,
I start by thinking about what's actuallygoing on inspace, and then get the computer to represent
things numerically, thereby figuring out wheretoplace the pixels on the screen, and doing
that usually relies on a lot of linear algebraunderstanding.So there are your vector basics, and in the
next video I'll start getting into some prettyneatconcepts surrounding vectors, like span, bases,
and linear dependence.See you then!Captioned by Navjivan Pal
