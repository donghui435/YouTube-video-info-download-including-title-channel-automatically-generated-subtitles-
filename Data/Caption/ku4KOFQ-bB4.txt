- [Voiceover] For as long as humanbeings have been around we'vebeen counting things, and we've beenlooking for ways to keep track andrepresent those things that we counted.So, for example if you werean early human and you weretrying to keep track of the dayssince it last rained you might sayokay let's see it didn't rain today soone day has gone by, and we now usethe word one, but they might havenot used it back then.Now another day goes by.Then another day goes by.Then another day goes by.Another day goes by.Another day goes by.Another day goes by, then it rained.And so when his friend comeshe says, "Well, how long has it beensince we last rained."Well you would say, "Well, this is howmany days it's been."And your friend would say, "Okay,I think I have a general sense of that."And at some point they probablyrealized that it's useful to have namesfor these.So they would call this one, two, three,four, five, six, seven.Obviously every language in the worldhas different names for these.I'm sure there are lost languagesthat had other names for them.But very quickly you start torealize that this is a pretty bulkyway of representing numbers.One it takes a long time to write down.It takes up a lot of space,and then later if someone wants toread the number they have to sit hereand count.It's hard enough with seven,but you could imagine if there werewhat we call 27 of it, or 1000 of it.Then it would take up, possibly, a wholepage and even when you countedyou might make a mistake.And to solve this human beingshave invented number systems.And it's something that
we take for granted.You might say, "Oh, isn't that just theway you've always counted?But hopefully over the courseof this video you'll start to appreciatethe beauty of a number systemand to realize our number system isn'tthe only number system that is around.The number system that mostof us are familiar with is the base 10number system.Often called the decimal, the decimalnumber system.And why 10?Well probably because we have 10 fingers.Or most of us have 10 fingers.So, it was very natural to thinkin terms of bundles of 10 or to have 10symbols.So however many bundles you haveyou can use your fingers and eventuallyyour symbols to think
about how many there are.And since we needed 10 symbolswe came up with zero,
one, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight, nine.These 10 digits, these are our 10 symbolsthat we use in the base 10 system.To just give us a little bit of a reminderhow we use them imagine the number 231.So, 231. 231.What does this represent?Well, what's neat about number systemsis we have place value.This place all the way to the right,this is the ones place.This is the ones place.This literally means one, one.One bundle of one.So, this is one, one right over here.This right over here,
this is in the 10s place.This is in the 10s place.This three here,
literally means three 10s.So this literally means three 10s.And this two here, this two here is inthe 100s place.It's in the 100s place.So, this represent two 100s.You add them together and once againI'm still thinking in base 10, you'dget 231.This is two 100s plus three 10s plus one.In our base 10 system notice everytime we move to the left we're thinkingin bundles of 10 of the spaceto the right.So, this is the ones place.You multiply by 10, you
go to the 10s place.You want to go to the next placeyou multiply by 10 again.You get the 100s place.If you're familiar with exponents,one is the same thing
as 10 to the zero power.10 is the same thing as
10 to the first power.So this is the 10s place. Three tens.And 100 is the same thing as 10to the second power.Obviously we could keep going on and onand on and on and on.That is the power of the base 10 system.So, you might be curious now."Well, what if this wasn't 10 here?What if we did, let's just go as simpleas we can. You can almost view thisas a base one system.You only have one symbol right over here.But what if we went to something slightlymore complex, a base two system.You'd be happy to know that not onlycan we do this, but the base two systemoften called the binary system.This is called the decimal system.The base two system often calledthe binary system is the basis of allmodern computing.It's the underlying mathematicsand operations that computers performare based on binary.And in binary you have two symbols.You have zero and you have one.The reason why this is
useful for computationis because all the hardware that we useto make our modern computers, allof the transistors and the logic gatesthey either result in
an on or an off state.On or an off state.And so what we do is when you useyour calculator or whatever you mightbe operating in base 10, but underlyingeverything it is doing the operationsin binary.But you might say well how do weactually think in terms of binary?Well, we can construct
similar places here,but instead of them being powers of 10they're going to be powers of two.So, let's set up some places here.So, all the way on the righttwo to the zero power is still one.So we can still call that the ones place.Then we can move to the left of that.We can move to the left of that.That would be two to the first power.So we could call that the twos place,and I can even write it out if I want.Twos place instead of the 10s place.Then I could keep going.Instead of this space being the 10 tothe second or the 100s place, it will bethe two to the second, or the fours place.And I can keep going.I encourage you actually to pausethe video and try to build this outfor yourself.What would this be?Well this would be two to the third,or the eights place.Notice every time we're doing thiswe're multiplying by two.Everytime we go to the left,just like we multiplied by 10 here.So notice everywhere you see this 10swe're now dealing with twos.Let's keep going.Let's keep going and then we can actuallyrepresent this number using binary.So, let's do that.So, this right over here I've alreadyused that color.This right over here, this is twoto the fourth.We could call that the 16s place.Then we could have --I'll reuse some of these colors.This is two to the fifth.We could call this the 32s place.Then we can go two to the sixth.We can call that, multiply by two again,or two to the six is 64.So this is the 64s place.Tells us how many 64s we
have. Zero or one 64s.We'll see that in a second.Then we can go over here.This would be two to the seventh.That would be the 128s place.And we can obviously keep going onand on and on, but this
should be enough forme to represent this number.In future videos I will show you howto do that, but let's actually representthe number.It turns out that this numberin decimal can be representedas 11100111 in binary.What does this mean?This means you have one 128 plus one 64,plus one 32, plus no 16s, plus no eights,plus one four, plus one two, plus one one.So you can see that these are goingto be the same thing.Notice, this is one 128.So it's 128, plus 64, plus 32.We have zero 16s, zero eights.So we're not going to add those.Plus four, one four.Plus one two.Plus one one.And add these together,and once again when we're doing this,when I'm writing it this way I'mkind of using the number systemthat we're most familiar with.We're most used to
doing the operations in,but when you do it you will see thatthis is the exact same number as 231.This is just another representation.One isn't better than the other.The only reason why I converted thisis this is what I'm used to thinking in.It's what I'm used to doing operations in.So, hopefully you find
that pretty interesting.To me, this kind of opened my mindto the power of even our decimal system.In future videos we'll explore othernumber systems.The most used ones, base 10 isused very heavily, binary and there'salso hexadecimal where you don't havetwo digits or not 10 digits,
but you have 16 digits.And we'll explore those in future videosand how to convert between or rewrite thethe different representations
and different bases.
