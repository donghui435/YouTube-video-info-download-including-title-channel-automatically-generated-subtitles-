let's go ahead and see if we can graph yequals three cotangent of PI X dividedby two all rightif you guys looked at the paragraphwhich hopefully you've already done andalready have written down you'll noticethat the cotangent engines do not havean amplitude right there's norestriction on how high they are howlowly go they go infinitely up andinfinitely down as they approachasymptotes now so what we need to do iswe don't need to worry about finding onup today markthis three is still gonna have an impacton a graph and I'll show you how it'sgonna have an impact the next thing weneed to understand is what our period iswe are gonna have to understand what theperiod is so unlike sonic coattail sineand cosine the period is now going to bePI over B and remember the period is thedistance that it's going to take yourgraph to complete one function so B inthis case is going to be PI over two soI take PIover PI over 2 multiplied by thereciprocal right and what's gonna happenis those s cares now our PI's cancel ohnever left with 2 therefore the distancethat's gonna take for us to complete onecycle in coq10 in this cotangent graphis going to be 2now one thing if you guys remember whenwe're talking on our translations arehorizontal translations of a regulargraph for sine and cosine we had a ourperiod end points rip from like 0 to PIand maybe I was a man takes exampleso if you guys looked at itthat was this was called a paragraphthis is one period for the paragraphthese photos this is one period from theparagraph alright and what you notice isit kind of has an asymptote at zero andthat pot alright so what we want to dois now you can see but this was that wasfor y equals cotangent of X all rightobviously we've made some changes rightthere's obviously going to be adifference now we're it's PI X dividedby two so our graph is going to look upit's going to look different so all wewant to do is we want to find out whatis our new period which is two then wewant to find out what are our newasymptotes going to be so right nowcurrently our asymptotes are f 0 and popso originally these were your values ofX your asymptotes are at X where youknow zero was your x value and PI wasyour x valuewell how did our X values change nowthey're being multiplied by PI anddivided by two so all I want you to dois whatever take whatever is inside yourfunction and put that equal to whatyou're at two asymptotes areokay so you always take whatever's inyour function and you set it equal toyour two original asymptotes so forcotangent your asymptotes are at zeroand at PI now what we do is solve for xall by our to both sideszero equals pi x/ pizero yes okaythen for this one I multiply by 2 onboth sidesand I divide by five so we have two piequals PI over X divided by fiveand I listen to people that's so now Idon't have an asset to a pet pie now I'mgonna have an asymptote bad - well youmight say well how does that relateremember hi guys is a number pi is3.14159 right so 2 is going to be like alittle bit short then so I'm just gonnaactually draw leave the paragraph uphere but I'm just going to draw a graphredwood so they said we have anasymptote at 0 so you just make a nicelittle dotted line to represent yourasymptotes then you're asking told isalso going to be at 2okay now one thing you need tounderstand is this intercept for yournormal graph for your paragraph was atPI over 2 so it's halfway between yourtwo intercepts so it splits it so ifthis set to my new intercept is going tobe at 1 okay now the next thing beforeyou can start by graphing the next thingwe need to do is determine well where ifI don't need to do another periodwhere's my next intercept going to gowell ladies and gentlemenif here from here here is - how long isour periods our parents are long - so mynext asymptote is going to be another -moreover which will give us 4 so you canjust say our next period there's gonnabe some one right therewhich is going to be at 4 and then ifthis is at 1 if I add 2 - 1 and anotherperiod to it what I'm going to do isyou're not being any more descriptiveplease put that away and then look uphere if I'm adding 2 to this I'm gonnaget this at 3 make sense ok so now let'sgo and see what is our graph gonna looklike now ladies and gentlemen the thebest way to really do this is to findfind coordinate points and plug them inso if I know that you know my coordinategraph is a tan of God then what I coulddo is maybe plug in and this is PI over2 maybe I can plug in like tan of PIover 3 which is right there and maybeplug in tan of 2 PI over 3 so if youplug those in your calculator you couldfigure out what are your x-valuesokay you guys can plug those in yourcoupler and see what the x values arefor thoseand that will tell you exactly where toplot your points to help you get theexact curve you want okayhowever for right now I just want towork on estimating I'm not reallyconcerned about you guys getting theexact values of graphs I just want tomake sure you guys understand what thegraph is gonna look like and how ourtransformations are gonna help it so ifyou guys can go back a little bit youguys remember your x squared rightyour parabola correctdo you guys member what happened when Isaid what was one-third x squared whathappened to your parabola not does mmwhat happened to get wider or smallerokay did it get stretched or compressedit already stretched right so itactually got widerokay then what happens when it was whatabout when he was 3 X so if I said 3 Xsquare it actually got compressed andlooked more like this right well guesswhat ladies and gentlemen withoutplugging in any points you can determinethat this is going to be this is gonnafollow the exact same rules so this iswhat my paragraph looks like here I'mgonna have a 3 cocaine that means I'mgoing to compress it so it's just gonnabe a lot shorter of a curve so it'sstill going to approach my asymptotesbut you maybe say it's gonna approachmen at much smaller curveokay yesfor the asymptotes you knowhave any some equations in figured outhe just look that's the path or thecotangent crap and found that I was justI knew from your paragraphs as I toldyou guys I didn't just make the pair theasymptotes for a cotangent aren't at 0and PI so that is what your paragraphare so to find your new asymptotes youhave to set them equal to whatever yourfunction is so that's what I didyes did you use any of the horizontalyeahyeah it's just going to tell you yeah Imean it depends on where you want it yesexactlyI'm just using the house until 2 0 andPI because those are algebraicallyprobably to easiest to use but yeah ifyou want to graph it in the negative andjust say what's gonna happen where mygraph B if it was at negative PI and 0or at negative 2 pi and negative PI thatyeah we're still works out all right soyou guys see how my graph would looklike this it's just gonna be skinnier ifyou want to verify the fact pick pointsdo tangent of 1/2 a new tangent offorward in v2 so you know pick Canton of3/4 or something and just see how that'sgonna change your graph all right butFrank now I just want to make sure youguys understand that if you're gonnahave a number that's greater than 1 infront of your function just make yourgraph right now sketching it skinnierand if it's less than 1 you're justgoing to if it was less than 1 then itlooks something more like this and it'dbe a much wider kind of grab stillapproaches your asset open it stillcross it at the same point but kind oflike the slow penis of how it crosses orhow it reflects over is gonna bedifferent so that make sense ok so yournumber in front does not change you'reafter there's no empty good what it'sgonna do is going to now determine kindof it's stretched or compress it allokay that's all it determines all rightand like I said guys I'll I meanjust for time purposes I'm not gonna gothrough graphing the different pointsall right but if you guys can justunderstand that's going to be a widerthey consider the ground yes no the sineand cosine different the sine and cosinethat's gonna be telling you what youramplitude is it still does you'restretching you're pressing but itdoesn't in a different way ain't got anyother general questions
