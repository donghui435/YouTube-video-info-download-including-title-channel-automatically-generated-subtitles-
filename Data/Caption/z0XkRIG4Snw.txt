now one of the most valuable pieces ofequipment for your mathematics exam is acalculator now the calculator is onlyvaluable if you actually know how to useit properly so what we're going to donow is to take a look around the keys ona standard scientific calculator andmake sure you can use them properly andget those all-important correct answersin your exam now it might not beidentical to the ones that you have butthen you need to make sure that you readthe manual that comes with yourcalculator properly and make sure youknow how to use all the buttons on yourown individual calculator the firstbutton we're going to look at is themode button now the reason why this issuch an important button is because youmust ensure your calculator is in thecorrect mode before you perform anycalculations in your exam now that modeneeds to be the degree mode and bypressing the mode button on yourcalculator it will allow you to selectthe option either referred to as degreeor deg and that will put your calculatorin the correct mode so do ensure beforeyou do any calculations that you are inthe right mode which is the degree modethe next button we're going to look atis the second button now if we take alook again at the layout on thiscalculator you see the second button isactually a purple button on ourcalculator now sometimes on calculatorsthis is referred to as the shift buttonand what it does is it allows you toaccess a whole new set of operationsthat are found above the standard keyson the keypad so if we look at thiscalculator here you can see that allthose operations colored purple areaccessed by first pressing the secondbutton and then the key that liesunderneath the operation we want we'regoing to look at this in more detailwith certain specific operations butit's important to know that we need topress that second button in order toaccess those operations so let's look athow we raise a number to the power ofanother number using our calculator nowon our calculator here we're using the Xto the power of Y button so if we wantedto for example enter 2 to the power of 7we would enter on our calculator 2 thenpress the button X to the power of Y andthen the number 7 and it would give usthe correct answer now make sure againbecause it may be different on yourcalculator that you know which buttonraises a number to the power of anothernumbernow let's look at how to square a numberusing a calculator it should be quiteobvious especially on this calculatorlayout here that the x-squared button isthe button we need in order to square anumber so in this case if we wanted todo five squared we would press five andthen the x squared button and it wouldgive us our answer of 25 let's look nowat how we would cube a number now on ourcalculator here you can see that the Xcubed is actually in purple above the xsquared bun so that means we need to usethat second button in order to accessthat operation so if we wanted to cube 3we would press 3 then the second buttonthen our x squared bun which wouldenable us to access that X cubedoperation which would give us our answerof 27 now it's worth remembering that onyour calculators your x cubed button maynot be above that x squared button soensure again you read your manuals andmake sure you know where the cubedbutton is on your own calculatorsnow button is quite often used in examsis the square root button and you shouldall be able to identify that quiteeasily on your calculators by lookingfor that square root symbol now on thiscalculator we have here we wouldactually type in the number and thenpress the square root button in order toget our square root but on somecalculators you actually need to pressthe button before you enter the numberso again as always make sure you knowhow your own individual calculators workyou may also need to perform a cube rootin some calculations and in thiscalculator that we have here the cuberoot button is accessed by going throughthe second button and pressing thesquare root button so if we take a lookhere if I wanted to cube root eight Iwould type eight then press the secondbutton the square root button whichwould then access the cube root for meand I would come up with my answer oftwo now again some times the cube rootbutton isn't with the square root buttonand you need to make sure you know whereit is on your calculatornow for higher GCSE candidates you needto know how to perform calculationsusing trigonometry and if we look at thekeys on our calculator here you can seequite clearly indicated the sine cosineand tangent ratios on the keys here nowremember the difference between thosetrigonometry questions when you'refinding a length or an angle becauseyou'll notice above each of thosetrigonometry buttons you have sineinverse cosine inverse and tangentinverse which you will need to access byusing either your second button or yourshift key so if you're calculating anangle remember you are using the inverseratio and if you're working at a lengthyou will just be using one of thosestandard sine cosine or tangent buttonsnow we'll look at how you enterfractions into your calculator and thereis a special button to enable you to dothis on some calculators like the one wehave here it is the a and B over Cbutton but on others you will actuallysee something that looks like a fractionpossibly with a square above anothersquare or indeed those squares in theformat of a mixed number so make sureyou know where those buttons are on yourcalculator now on ours if we wanted toenter for example 3/4 we would press thenumber 3 then our fraction button andthen the number 4 if you want to use amixed number in one of your calculationsyou just need to press that fractionbutton twice so for example 3 and 1/2would be accessed by going 3 thefraction button 1 the fraction buttonand then the number 2 when it comes toperforming calculations for example inquestions where there are circles youneed to be able to access the pie buttonon your calculator so using thisparticular calculator you see for us toinsert a value for piewe need to press the 2nd button thenthat exp button and you see then thatthe pie symbol comes up on the screen ofour calculator and then we can use thatin any calculationanother important button on thecalculator is the ANS button whichstands for answer and what it does do isenable you to use an answer from aprevious calculation in the nextcalculation you wish to perform which isespecially useful if you have acalculator display full of numbers souse that button to take the answeryou've just worked out into the nextcalculation you need it for now it'sworth noting that calculators alwaysperform calculations using big mats soif you want the calculator to do a sumin a particular order you will need touse the brackets buttons on yourcalculator keypad you can see them quiteclearly on our calculator here and allwe need to do is to put those around theparticular sum that we want thecalculator to perform before anythingelsemany calculators now give you the answerto a calculation in either a fraction orsurd form now if you need to turn thatinto a decimal for example to round itto a certain degree of accuracy then youneed to use the SD button on yourcalculator now our calculator heredoesn't need that SD button because itdoesn't give us the answer in that formbut if yours does you need to know wherethis button is on your calculator keypadin order to change your answer into theform you require now you will see abovethe button that says log on thecalculator keypad there is a purplesymbol that says 10 to the power of X soagain this is accessed using the secondbutton and it's a useful button to haveif we're performing a calculationbetween two numbers that are in standardfour now if you do have two numbers instandard form that you're performing acalculation on you must make sure thatyou use those brackets buttons to put abracket around each number in thecalculation so that the calculator willdo it correctlynow in the bottom right hand cornerabove the equals key you will see apercentage symbol and that comes in veryhandy when we want to work out thepercentage of a quantity so for exampleif we wanted to work out 15 percent of60 using the calculator we would press1/5 the second button which enables usto access the percentage operation thenmultiply key and then the keys 6 and 0press equals which would give us ouranswer of nine if you enter aparticularly long calculation into yourcalculator and then make a mistake rightat the very end of it or maybe partwaythrough it you can get rid of anyparticular number or operation thatyou've put in in error by using the de Lor delete key by pressing that button itwill then remove the previous number oroperation from your calculation again asalways read the manual that comes withyour calculator properly and make sureyou know how to use all the buttons onyour own individual calculators
