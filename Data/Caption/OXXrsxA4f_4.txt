hello in this example we want toevaluate the difference quotient and ifyou've never seen a difference quotientbefore it's basically this over hereit's the f of X plus h minus f of X alldivided by H now usually what givespeople the majority of the problem isjust grabbing a function and being ableto plug it into the difference quotientso in order to do that notice that thedifference quotient is made up of threeparts first you have this f of X plus hthen you have an f of X and then an H onthe bottom so you know what f of X isand the H is just going to stay the samethis guy that's the one that causesissues so to see how that's going towork imagine going through this what ifI gave you a number like f of 2 well youmight say hey all's I need to do is puta 2 in for my X's and that'd be correctwe would substitute it in well what if Igave you something different what if Igave you F of triangleit's a hold on it works the same way I'mjust going to put in a triangle whereverI see an X well you got the right ideaso if I see something like f of X plus hI'm just going to replace my X's with anX plus h so this is exactly the piece weneed for this part of the differencequotient all right I think we're readyto start plug things in so first I'mgoing to plug in the f of X plus h so Xplus h squared minus 1 looks good andthen I have my f of X x squared minus 1and according to the difference quotientI want to subtract so subtract f of Xnow make sure that you want to subtractthe entire function and use a set ofparentheses to remind yourself that thatis what you are doing all divided by Hlooks pretty good now once you get intothe difference quotient it must besimplified fortunately most differencequotientsactually simplify fairly nicely let's gothrough and do that so here I can foilit get x squared plus 2xh plus h squaredI have a minus 1 and then I candistribute the negative sign on theinside alright looks good now we examineit see if there's anything we can cancelout well I do see some x squared solet's get rid of those I see a minus 1and a plus 1 those are gone so now wejust have looks like 2x h plus h squaredall over H all right this thing islooking great now we've got lots of H'sin fact both terms in the top have an Hso we can factor that out as wellnow the reason for factoring is you canthen cancel out these H's all right soyou can see in the very end when wesimplify the difference quotient we justhave 2x plus h and there you have it soyou can see the hardest part is reallyjust putting everything into thedifference quotient and really justtrying to simplify it if you'd like tosee some more videos please visitmysecretmathtutor.com
