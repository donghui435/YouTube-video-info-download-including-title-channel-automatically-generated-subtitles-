hi this is press talker let's discussthe braised paradox which states thatadding a road could possibly slow downtraffic this is a counterintuitivephenomenon but researchers have actuallyidentified roads where the existence ofthese roads slows down traffic andactually closing those roads could speedup traffic and these are in busy areaslike New York City Boston and evenLondon so how is this possible we needto go through a mathematical exampleimagine you're traveling from A to B butyou can't travel directly you have totravel on one of these routes some ofthe roads take 20 minutes flat whereasother roads take T over 10 minutes whereT depends on the level of traffic we canask how long would it take for 200drivers to go along this network it'spretty easy to see the roads are equallypreferable so the 200 drivers wouldsplit up T equals 100 to each route thatwould make the traffic dependent roadstake ten minutes each and therefore thetotal travel time from A to B would be30 minutes we can consider the sameexact network of roads and the sametravel times but we'll add one more roadthis road takes zero minutes and allowsus to travel between the two routes nowwhat will the travel time be oneobservation is that T over ten willalways be less than or equal to 20minutes even if all drivers take thatroad therefore the T over ten roads arealways preferable so all 200 driverstake these roads and they take 20minutes eachand therefore the total travel time willbe 40 minutes to get from A to B andthis is the braised paradox Illustratedbefore we had the free road the traveltime was 30 minutes and the free Roadmade the travel time 40 minutes becauseeveryone got congested on the same Roadthis has many applications in physics wecan look at the distance of a spring inbasketball explains the Ewing paradoxand it can even happen in electricitytransmission which is also network ifyou liked this video please get my bookthe joy of game theory which covers suchinteresting topics and please subscribeto my channel I make videos on math andgame theory you can support me onpatreon catch me on my blog minordecisions on Twitter at fresh hollowoccur and you can get all of my booksand Amazon
