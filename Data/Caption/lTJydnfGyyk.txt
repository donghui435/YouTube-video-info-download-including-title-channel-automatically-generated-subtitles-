hey this is pressure Locker with youreyes closed you roll a pair of dice thecasino dealer announces that at leastone of the rolls is a one what is theprobability that both rolls show a onegive this problem a try and when you'reready keep watching the video for thesolution the surprising result is theprobability is not 1/6 imagine thecasino offered this game with stakes ifyou thought the probability was 1/6 thenyou would be willing to offer a $1 betfor a $6 payout that both dice wereshowing the 1 you would think this is afair game but in fact you would belosing money on average the casinoshould actually be offering an $11payout for this to be a fair game theprobability that both dice are showingthe 1 is actually much lower let'scalculate this when you roll a pair ofdice there are 36 equally likelyoutcomes each die can show a numberbetween 1 & 6this creates 36 different pairs when thecasino dealer announces that at leastone dice is showing a 1 we need toeliminate all the different pairs whichdo not include a 1 let's count thenumber of pairs which do include a 1there are 11 different pairs and theseare equally likely rolls to happen nowin ten of these events one of the diceis showing a 1 and the other dice is nota 1 in exactly one of the cases both ofthe dice are showing a 1 therefore thereis a 1 in 11 chance or about a 9 point 1percent probability that both dice areshowing a 1 this is a surprising resultand to give further evidence of thiswe're going to do a numerical simulationin a spreadsheet we're going to set up aspreadsheet in which we do a numericalestimation of the probabilitywe imagine rolling two dice labeled aand B our sample space is the number oftrials in which at least one dice isshowing a 1 a success in our experimentis a case in which both dice are showinga 1 to roll a dice in a spreadsheet weuse the function ran between and wegenerate a random number between 1 and 6our sample space is the number of trialsin which at least one roll is showing a1 so we're going to set up a formulathat at least one roll has to be equalto 1 then we'll allow it in our samplespace count it with the 1 otherwisewe'll count it as a zero now we want tosee a success in which both dice areshowing a 1 so this both dice areshowing the one we're going to countthat as a success otherwise we excludeit so this is one roll of the diceneither of them show to one so we cancopy these formulas down and eventuallywe'll get to a case in which one of thedice is showing one so this formulacalculates that yes we're going to countthis in our sample space now to get anaccurate representation of theprobability we're gonna want to copythis down many many times eventuallywe'll get to a case in which both diceare showing the 1 so I'm going to copythis down and we're going to imaginedoing 10,000 rolls so now we can countthe number of times in which at leastone dice is showing a 1 this will be thesum of the third column this is about3,000 out of the 10,000 rolls and noticethis is approximately 30% which is aboutthe 11 over 36 that I was saying wereequally likely events we now want toknow the proportion of these cases inwhich both rolls are showing a 1 thiswill be the sum of the successes in thefourth column this is about 270 so nowwe can calculate the probability thatboth rolls are one given at leastone is a 1 as the ratio of the successesdivided by the number of sample spacesnow this is nearly 9 percent and this isroughly equal to the probability wecalculated of 1 divided by 11 so thisagain justifies that 1 over 11 is thecorrect probability did you figure itout thanks for watching this videoplease subscribe to my channel I makevideos on math and game theory you cancatch her on my blog mind your decisionswhich you can follow on Facebook Google+and patreon you can catch me on socialmedia at pressure Locker and if youliked this video please check out mybooks there are links in the videodescription
