an algebraic sentence with an equal signis called an equation but if thesentence has a less than or a less thanor equal to sign or a greater than or agreater than or equal to sign then thatsentence is called an inequalityinequalities are solved like equationsyour job is to isolate the variable onone side of the inequality sign let'slook at a one-step inequality X minus 4is greater than or equal to 9using the same rules who would use insolving an equation we'll add 4 to bothsides of this inequality that willeliminate the minus 4 and leave us withour solution X is greater than or equalto 13 that means that either 13 or anynumber larger than 13 makes thisinequality true to check our solution wecan take 13 substitute it into theoriginal inequality and check to see ifit gives us a true statement 13 is equalto 13 13 minus 4 is 9 9 is equal to 9 soit is greater than or equal to 9 so thatpart of our solution is correct butunlike an equation we can't check everynumber in the solution we can'tsubstitute all the numbers greater thanor equal to 13 to see if they work wecan try one number that is greater than13 let's use 20 that's greater than 13and see if it gives us a true statement20 minus 4 is 16 16 is greater than orequal to 9 so that indicates oursolution is correct we can also pick anumber that's not in the solution suchas 10 and show that it gives us astatement that is not true 6 is notgreater than or equal to 9 so 10 anumber that is not greater than or equalto 13 is not in the solution so we canbe confident that our solution of X isgreater than or equal to 13 is correctthis use of the inverse operationsometimes known as the opposite operatorto solve inequalities works wonderfullyexcept in one case if we take a simpletrue inequality like negative 2 is lessthan 5 and multiply both sides by anegative number say negative 3 we get 6is less than negative 15 which is nottrue so in an inequality when youmultiply by a negative number or dividesince division is really justmultiplication by a reciprocal when youmultiply or divide by a negative numberyou must reverse the sign to keep yourtrue inequality if we had to solve aninequality such as negative 5 X isgreater than 20 we would have to divideboth sides by negative 5 to isolate theX now remember the rule since we'redividing both sides by a negative numberwe have to reverse the sign and oursolution is X is less than negative 4here's a situation where I'm going touse an inequality to help me I need totransport boxes of algebra books to thesecond floor using this elevator but theelevator has a maximum weight capacityof 1500 pounds that means if we put morethan 1500 pounds in the elevator it'llbreak now I'm 150 pounds Hey all rightI'm 165 pounds 180 pounds in theinterest of safety on the elevator we'llassume I'm 200 pounds thank you each boxof books is 40 pounds how many boxes canI put on the elevator with me so thetotal weight does not exceed 1500 poundswe'll set up an inequality let X equalthe number of boxes of books you'll takethe 200 pounds then add the books whichweigh 40 pounds per box the weight can'tbe more than 1500 so our inequality isless than or equal to 1500will solve the multi-step inequalityjust like a multi-step equation subtract200 from each side then divide by 40 andX is less than or equal to 32 and 5/10that's 32 and a half boxes of course I'mnot going to cut a box in half so themaximum number of boxes I can stack inhere is 32 finally the solution to anequation is in most cases a singlenumberbut with inequalities the solution is awhole set of numbers it's sometimeshelpful to draw a graph of the solutionremember the first inequality we solvedthe solution was X is greater than orequal to 13 to draw the graph we'll puta heavy dot on 13 because 13 is asolution and draw a solid line to theright of 13 ending with an arrow showingthat the set of numbers goes oninfinitely to the right all of thosenumbers covered by the line are part ofthe solution there are a few variationswhen it comes to graphing inequalitiesbesides greater than or equal to theinequality could have been just greaterthan or less than or equal to or justless than as in the case of the secondinequality we solved the solution was Xis less than negative 4 since this isstrictly less than the number negative 4is not part of the solution so insteadof a dot we draw an open circle aroundthe point negative 4 since every numberless than negative 4 is in the solutionwe'll draw our solid line to the left ofnegative 4 ending with an arrow showingthat the set of numbers goes oninfinitely to the left and goes upto butdoesn't include negative 4inequalities are mathematical sentenceswhere both sides are not necessarilyequal there are a lot like equations inthe way they're solved but unlikeequations in the nature of theirsolution practice solving inequalitiesyou'll get so good you'll be equal tonone
