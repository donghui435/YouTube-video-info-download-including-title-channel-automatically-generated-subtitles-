all right in this video we're going todo an example using Heron's formula andwhat this is it's just a way to find thearea of a triangle so if we have atriangle linked side links a B and C thefirst thing you're actually going to dois you're going to compute what's calledthe semi-perimeter and there we justtake a plus B plus C and divide it by 2we'll get a value for s and then what wedo underneath our square root we take stimes the quantity s minus a times sminus B times s minus C and that'ssimply going to give us the the area ofour triangle so let's do a little simpleexample here just illustrating this sowe want to know what's the area of atriangle with sides measuring fourinches six inches and nine inches wellthe first thing I would do would be tocompute this semi-perimeter so we'lltake four plus six plus nine and dividethat by two well let's see4 plus 6 is 10 plus 9 would be 19 over 2I think I'm just going to leave it as afraction for the time being and then itsays underneath our our square root sowe would basically just have the areaequals the square root of let's see so19 over 2 then will take 19 over 2 andwe'll subtract away the value for a wecan let that be the 4 then we'll take 19over 2 subtract away the value 6 andthen we'll take 19 over 2 and subtractaway the value of C we can let that be 9and that's going to now be an expressionfor the for the area so again I'm justtaking the semi-perimeter and then I'mtaking the semi-perimeter - each of theside links okay so now it's just alittle bit of simplification alright sohopefully nothing here too terriblelet's see so we've got 19 / - we couldalways make the 4 into an 8 over 2 so Iguess let's write this one all the wayout - 8 over 2we've got 19 over - we could make the 6into 12 over 2 we've got 19 over 2 wecould subtract away this would be 18over 2so let's see we've got 19 over to let'ssee I guess 19 minus 8 that would be 11/ - lets see 19 minus 12 that would giveus 7 over 2 and then 19 minus 18 thatwould give us 1 over 2 and at this pointI don't see much of anything that'sreally going to you know sort ofsimplify down nicelyyou know defens is going to cancel outthat's okay so let's see we can do 19times 11 times 7 times 1 I'm getting1463 over in the denominator you have 2times 2 which is 4 times 2 which is 80times 2 which is 16 and if you want towe can even break this up a little bitfurther we can always even simplify thisa little bit moreso we can do the square root of the topover the square root of the bottom so wecan actually write this as the squareroot of 1 4 6 3 over 4 and let's youknow let's get a feel for it let's justput it in a calculator so the squareroot of 1 4 6 3 I'm getting that to beroughly equal to 38 point two five afterrounding dividing by four so 38 point 25 divided by 4I'm getting this to be one there shouldbe nine point five six to five so thearea would be in this case nine pointfive six two five I think we were usinginches originally so in this case itwould be nine point five six two fivesquare inches so that's it so nothingtoo crazy at all you know maybe aformula you're not super familiar with Ikind of forget it from time to timeactually but certainly it's nice anduseful you know all you've got to do isjust remember just the formula and thenjust from the side lengths without doingmuch of anything you know normally we do1/2 base times height but to use youknow the 1/2 base times height formulawell we have to figure out the height ofthe triangle and this kind of dodges allthat all you need is just the sidelengths and you're in business
