Hello, everybody!It's snowing in the UK,so I thought I'd take this opportunityto tell you a little bit about the maths of a snowflake.Now, I could have done this inside, in the warm,but I decided to do it outside in the snow,like some sort of fool.But no matter.Now, water molecules form something calleda 'hexagonal lattice.'It looks--it looks like this.Now water molecules, as you may know,is H2O--that's one oxygen atomand two hydrogen atoms.So the blue dots hereare the oxygen atoms.The black sticks are the hydrogen,so it makes something that looks like this--like I said, this is called a hexagonal lattice.Now, as this grows, it grows into a hexagonal prism,which will have six-fold symmetry,which you can nearly see here.Now as this falls from the clouds,atmospheric conditions--changes in temperature, things like that--causes it to grow branchesat the six corners of the hexagonal prism.Now these branches are, in fact, grown independently,so they are not the same.So, in fact, snowflakesare not symmetrical.The vast majority of snowflakesare not symmetricalBut since the branches are grown under similar conditions,they are similar-looking branches,and so the snowflakesare nearly symmetrical.However,since no two paths are the same,each snowflakeis unique,and they do not look the same.So, as usual,if you have been,thanks for watching.I get to go inside now.
