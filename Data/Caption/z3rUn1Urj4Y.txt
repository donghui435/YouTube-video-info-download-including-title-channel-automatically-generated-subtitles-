alright so another example here aboutfinding the focus of a parabola and thefirst thing we're gonna have to do isactually come up with the equation ofthis parabolawell manipulate it a little bit and thenwe'll find the focus so we want to findthe focus of the parabola that hasvertex at negative 5 comma 2 so negative1 2 3 4 5 and positive 2 you don't haveto do this at all you don't have to drawthe picture but to me it definitelyhelps me it opens vertically so thatmeans it's gonna either open up or downit passes through this point negative 3comma zero so to me that's gonna tell methat it's opening downwards so okay thatmeans the focus should be sittingsomewhere sort of inside of there butthe first thing I'm going to do is findthe equation so it's of the form yequals a times X minus H squared plus Kwell they give us the vertex so we canplug that in we would have X minusnegative 5 or X plus 5 squared and thenthe y-value of the vertex is positive 2so that's what we'll just drop down inthere I can use this information that itpasses through the point negative 3 0 soif we use that it says if we plug 0 infor Y and negative 3 and for X this willnow give us an equation that will allowus to solve for a value I'm gonnasubtract the 2 overinside the parentheses we would have 2squared or 4 if we divide both sides by4 we'll get negative 2 over 4 or we'llget negative 1/2 as our a value allright so really the equation of ourparabola here would be y equals negative1/2 X plus 5 quantity squared plus 2 andthat certainly makes sense that my avalue should be negative because againthis parabola is opening downwards nowto me we've kind of got these twodifferent forms where there's an xsquared and the problem and wherethere's a y squared in the problemwell definitely we're gonna have onewhere there's an x squared inside ofthere again what I do is if there's anyif there's any coefficient other than a1 what I try to do is I try to get ridof that coefficient from the squaredterm so what I'm going to do is I'mactually going to multiply both sides bynegative 2 so I'll get negative 2yequals okay so if I multiply the rightside by negative 2so we've got negative 2y on the left ifwe distribute we'll have positive 1xplus 5 squared minus 4 I don't reallycare so much about the the negative 4 atall all that I want is I'm glad thatthere's now a coefficient of a 1 infront of my squared term once I do thatI look at the other side whatever issitting next to whatever the coefficienton the y term is we set for P for Pequal to that value okay so in this caseif we solve for P we're gonna get Pequals negative 2/4 or negative 1/2 ifyou take the absolute value of this thisnumber negative 1/2 that's gonna be thedistance that I go away from the vertexin order to do two things you could findthe directrix and you can also find thefocus so the idea is again if I take theabsolute value of negative 1/2 I wouldget positive 1/2 that's the distancefrom my vertex to my directrix that'salso the distance from my vertex to thefocus ok well we can now use thisinformation because we said the vertexwe said the vertex is at this pointnegative 5 comma 2 well clearly I'mmoving down 2 units to get to the focuswell if I'm moving down 2 unitsI would simply have to take my originaly-value where the focus was and well Iwould have to subtract 1/2 for that soin this case it looks like my focus Ikeep saying focus I wrote foci it lookslike our focus in this case would benegative 5/2 minus 1/2 andgonna give us three halves so that wouldbe the focus in this case we canactually figure out the directrix sincethis is the vertex is at y equals two ifwe add one-half to that we would get twoand a half or equivalently five halvesand that would actually be our directrixin this case and the problem didn't askfor it but you know why not go ahead andthink about it here
