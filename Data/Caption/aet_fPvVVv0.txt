alright so in this example what you guyswill be working on basically they'reasking us to solve our linearinequalities so to do that basicallywhat we have to do is graph each ofthese linear inequalities separately soboth these inequalities I'm going todecide to graph using slope interceptform so to go ahead and do that what I'mgoing to do is going to solve for y ineach case so I have 2y I'm sorry 2 X 2 Xplus y equals 3 and 3 X minus y equals 2now again the reason why I'm solvingthem with equals rather thaninequalities is when graphing especiallyin slope intercept form we think ofthings as terms of y equals MX plus Band I'm gonna sneeze I loved it everysingle time when I say I'm gonna say isI don't sneeze all rightso I set them as equation so now I canrewrite this as slope intercept form soto do that I subtract 2x on both sidesand I get y equals negative 2x plus 3over here it's very very important forus to understand I'm actually gonnaleave my inequality left there I don'tactually know why change that so here Isubtract 3x and I have negative y isless than negative 3x plus 2now notice ladies and gentlemen I am nowgoing to be dividing by negative 1remember whenever we divide we flip ourinequality symbol rightyes all 4 y is positive now we justidentify our slope and our y-intercepthere my y-intercept is 3 so on the yaxis i go up to 3 1 2 3 my slope isnegative 2 we always want to write ourslope as a fraction so that's gonna bedown 2 over 1 notice that this is lessthan so I'm gonna have a dashed lineokay now we go ahead and go to this onethis one has a y-intercept of negative 2make a point now my slope here is 3 over1 so I'm gonna go up 3 over 1 noticethat's greater than so again that'sgonna be a dashed line all right so nowladies and gentlemen what we're going tobe looking at is applying our testpoints ok so to do that we need todetermine a point that we can help usshade and the best point to always pickthat is as long as it's not on yourlines is 0 0 so I plug in 0 and for Xand 0 in for y so for this equationbecause remember this point 0 0 has an xin a y-coordinate 0 0 so therefore Ihave 0 is less than 3 is that true orfalse so that was a this equation sincethat's true for this equation I'm goingto shade towards the test point okaynow we go and trap this one 0 is greaterthan negative 2 is that true or falsetrue so again we're gonna shade towardsthe true points now you can see thatthis region is where it's true thisregion where it's true for bothinequalities so that is where I'm goingto shade
