g'day welcome with tech math Channelwhat we're going to be having a look atin this video is how to work out thesquare root of any number fairlyinstantly - I mean this turned out to beperfect square zero okay so I'll give anexample of this what is the square rootof 87 now this does not have a perfectsquare okay so how fast can you workthis out okaythree seconds yeah you should be able towork it out by now now the answer thatby the way was nine point three threeand I'm going to show you how to workthis sort of thing yet really reallyquickly so you got that congratulationsif you didn't you lucky lucky persongonna show you right now how to do it sojust a couple of things before I startthis does require that you will have abit of a working knowledge with perfectsquares what do I mean by that so thatyou know you know say 6 by 6 is 36 thesquare root of 36 is 6 yes or and justthose basic ones to start off with alsothis is fairly accurate but not ahundred percent accurate you'll see thisit gets pretty close but really reallyclose but it doesn't get a hundredpercent close okay so that's pretty goodthough now the way this works is followsokay so the square root of 87 the firstthing we do to work these out is we lookfor the perfect closest perfect squarebelow 87 okay though this well theclosest perfect square root I guessbefore 87 so we're looking the squareroot of 81 is equal to 9okay so that firm forms the whole numberpart of our answer okay that's the firstpart that's three paths what we're goingto be doing the second part is we'regoing to look at the difference betweenthese two numbers 87 and 81 okay so thedifference between 87 and 81 is 6 sowe're going to put this as a 6 okay I'mgoing to put this over now we all youknow is get this number here our wholenumber square and what we're going to dois we are going to double it 18 andthat's our answerokay so this is equal to 9 and 618 sonine and a third which is equal to we'llput this in red9.33 now how accurate is this I'll tellyou the actual answer the square root of87 I can tell you is in fact nine pointnine point three to seven okay so lookwe round up we'd actually get nine pointthree three but it's pretty close rightI'm pretty sure you'll agree this isreally really you know quite close soyou're just going to go through thosesteps okay you look for the perfectsquare the other square root below itthat's your whole number answer look atthe difference and then we're going todouble that answer or the to get thisparty okay we'll go through anothercouple of these all right all right sodid you like that I'll rub that outwe'll go through a bunch of examplesI'll tell you whatI'll go through a couple of examples andthen I'll give you something to do sowhat about the square root of 39 giveyou a couple of seconds to work that outyeah okayyou can even pause it if you want butyou know see here you go okay so theyou'll probably know that the squareroot of 36 is 6 okaydifference between these 39 and 36 is 3and double of 6 is 12 so answer is 6 and3 twelfths which is 6 and 1/4 which is 6point 2 5 okay ah the actual answer bythe way is 6 point 2 4 so we're not toofar off ok again really really closehow'd you go with that good if you needme to slow down you could always askcomputer but probably the best thing youmight want to do is maybe pause it oreven replay things if you have to Ithink that can help a lot okay whatabout the square root of what about thesquare root okay an easy one square rootof 12 okay now the square root of 12 youshould be able to work that out becauseyou have the square root of 9 is equalto 3difference between nine and twelve isthree and a double of this throw here issix so this is three and three six whichis three and a half which is 3.5 nowwhat is the actual square root of 12 theactual square root of 12 is three pointfour six okay so we're not really thatfar off are we okay I'll give you a fewexamples R and C here you go you canpause these up you know check out thisis really really simple once you get abit of a hang of it so the couple ofones I'll get you doing is the squareroot of about twenty-seven the squareroot of got a bigger one for you guys138 the square root of which one maybewhat about 18 okayalright pause the video see here you gothe case I had you go or we go through afew of these answers ok the square rootof 27 so the square root of 27 the nextone below this is I lost that they'llhave to find that back when I said pullthat back very goodsquare root of this closest one is asquare root of 25 okay so the squareroot of 25 so our answer is going to bea 5 the difference between these is 2and double of 5 is 10 so this youprobably get the answer of 5.2 all rightthe actual answer of the square root of20 are of the actual answer in squareroot of 27 by the way is 5.19okay 196 as you go that good or I'll dothis in a different colorwell that's square root of 138 like Idid go a bit high this time but 11 11s121 so the square root of 121 okay we'regoing to be getting 11 as our answerthere the difference between these twois 17 the double of 11 is 22okay this fractions a little bit harderyou can sort of look at and go this isalmost 15 out of 20 this is almost 11.75okay you want to get it exactly and youcould really work it out you know buteleven point seven seven is the exact ofyou with this but eleven point sevenfive is a good approximation so andfunnily enough eleven point seven fiveis the exact square root so I put in ifyou were to work out this it would beeleven point seven seven but the exactsquare root is eleven point seven fiveso not bad okaylast one like he lost what about squareroot of 18okay then one below this is the squareroot of mental blank for a minute squareroot of 16 which is 4 that happensdoesn't it there the difference betweenthose guys is two and a double of fouris eight so this is four point two fiveokay four point two five which is veryclose to the actual square rootwhich is the square root of 18 is 4.24don't do that what right the differencebetween those guys yeah I did do thatright they come living in a funny littleland okay or some second guess myself sothat's pretty easy rightso hopefully you like this trick andhopefully I didn't make too manymistakes so I do those occasionally likewe all doof course why make mistakes get on thereFlay me tell me off all rightanyway I hope you enjoyed that trickit's really great to our make a videofor you guys see you next timesee ya
