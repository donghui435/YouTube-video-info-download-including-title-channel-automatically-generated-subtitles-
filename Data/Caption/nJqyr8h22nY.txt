welcome let's address the age-oldquestion that drives students and manyteachers nutswhy is negative times negative positivelet's answer this a couple of ways butfirst of all let's make sure weunderstand what multiplication is atleast at a very basic level for exampleif I write five times three that can bethought of as repeated addition at leastat the level of counting numbers manymathematicians will disagree with me butat the very beginning this can bethought of as five groups of three soit's 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3 ofcourse given the answer 15 what's verycurious here not many people seem toevery recognizes is curious that 3 times5 which is actually completely differentobject it's 3 groups of 5 actually hasthe same answers 15 we're so used tothis that we don't question anymore butthere's a lovely geometric understandingof why this would be case why is a timesB whoops a times B sure to be the sameas B times a at least for countingnumbers well let's have a look at it 5groups of 3 let's actually councilmanlet's draw dots here's one group of 3dots there's a second group of 3 dotshere's a third group of 3 dots a fourthgroup of 3 dots and finally a fifthgroup of 3 dots so if I look this wayI am indeed seeing five groups of threethe 15 dots what's interesting is Ichanged my perspective and look this wayI'm really seeing this problem threegroups of five it's the same picture thesame number of dotstherefore the answers must be the sameof course there's matter which numbers Iuse in particular which accountingnumbers whose in particular a times B issure to be B times a by this geometricrepresentation alright so there we gofor at least four positive countingnumbers we know what multiplicationmeans and we know that multiplication iscommutative let's start bringingnegative numbers into the mix so let'slook at this here's a positive numbertimes a negative number can I make senseof this well if I think of as additionof multiplication as repeated additionit's fine this is saying five groups ofnegative three so here's two of themhere's a third negative three andnegative three that doth negative 15make so five groups negative three not aproblemnegativeDean positive times negative in thiscase is negative now comes somethingcurious well why would I ask for withnegative three times five in my modelthis typically does not make sensenegative three groups of five no ideawhat that meansnow I have to go come to a choice thiscommutative law a times B equals B timesa dewy feel so comfortable this law thatwe think it should be true for all typesof numbers and particular negativenumbers most people to answer yes butI'd like to recognize that really is achoice if we do say yes then we couldanswer this problem now you three timesfive should be no different for negativefive times negative three which willhere the answer is negative fifteen hereit is the previous problem so if wechoose to believe that numbers arecumulative with regard to multiplicationeven negative ones then we can handlenegative times positivenow comes the juicy one let's get rid ofthis it goes and let's examine nownegative times positive for examplelet's look at negative three timesnegative five well if I switch the orderaround make this negative positivenegative three I'm still stuck I do notknow which what to assign to thisalright let's go back a step again let'slook at more complicated multiplicationlet's look at something like 27 timesthe fifteen I can think of this reallyis a geometry problem again I can saythis is he goes a rectangle with oneside being 27 inches long another sidebeing 50 inches long and I'm asking forthe area of this rectangle well thesenumbers 27 15 are Ted awkward let'ssplit the 15 to two easier numbers say10 and 5 and let's also split that 27into two easier numbers let's make atwenty and seven so now means mymultiplication problems really comes tofor smaller problems what's the area ofthis space is twenty by ten rectangle orthe answers 200 what's the area of thispiece it's 20 by five areas one hundredarea this part is 70 and xerath's fourthpart is thirty-fivetherefore I can say the 27 times 15 isthe same as 200 plus 100 plus seventyplus 35 I believe that's 405 all rightfabulous we've just seen that 27 times15 is 405 though what may be a littlesneaky and redo the problem in quite astrange way I'll still split the 10 tothe 15 into 10 and 5 Plus this timesplit 27 into 30 and negative 3 if we'reto believe that arithmetic of allnumbers applies to negative numbers aswell then even though I do not know whata side link negative 3 just means themathematics behind this diagram we mightsay is still valid all right accordingto this diagram what is 27 times 15 wellthis piece is 330 times 10 the space is30 times our 550 this piece is negative3 times 10 we can deal with negativetimes positive just done done thatthat's negative 30 and this piece isnegative 15 so this is telling me theasset of 15 times 27 is 300 450 minus 30is 420 minus 15lo and behold 405 starting the problemthis way again gives me 405 now let's bevery strange let's solve the sameproblem again a third way again I'lldraw a rectangle but whoops let's getback to my brush mark here draw arectangle but instead of doing 27 is 20plus 7 let's again do it as 30 minus 3and so during 15 is 4 10 plus 15 as twoit's 20 and negative 5 now what positivetimes positive here no doubt that's 600negative 3 times 20 we've dealt withnames times positive that's negative 60negative 5 and 30 we've dealt with thatsnegative hundred and 50 but this onenegative 3 times negative 5 that is mymystery question I know we've beentrained to say negative 15 but let's sayI want the math tell me what should beright now it's a mystery well we knowthe answers problem has to be 405 soright now we have 600 we have negativehundred 50 we have negative 60and a mystery number and that and weknow the answer must be 405 can the mathtell us what this mystery answer must bewell yes 600 takeaway hundred 50 that's450 takeaway 60 that is 390 plussomething mysterious must be 405 wellthere it is the math is telling me thismysterious object must be 15 that ispositive 15 I am forced to say thatnegative 3 times negative 5 is positive15in fact you use this argument that anyschool student can use this argumentjustify about any pair of numbersnegative numbers when multipliedtogether must be positive for example ifyou want to show that no negative 4times negative 8 is positive I'dprobably look at no say 16 times 22 andthink of that two different ways therewe arewell let me be a little moremathematical and for those that want thetrue mathematical reasons why negativetimes negative is positive it's hiddenbehind the scenes in this argument letme give it to you one begins by listingthe rules of arithmetic that one thingshould be true whoo
