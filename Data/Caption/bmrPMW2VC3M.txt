now last week you spent a day looking atthree words that started with M butyou've met before right what are thewords thank you mean it's worth eventhough you've um I've been looking atthese already I'd love you to write themagain because we're gonna brieflydiscuss them and learn some stuff aboutthem that'll help us do the next themedian and mode is it is it a rhyme thathas to do with a cat yeah well I meanI've seen before I should make make aposter out uh your works okay well let'sjust run with it right now what I'mgonna do is just quickly revise likewhat is each one but more important iswhat 11e is about like when do you pickdo you remember when we were looking atseveral sizes and all that kind of thingand which kind of samples you can shootand the hardest thing about all of thisis not calculating it but choosing onethat's tricky okay so let's remember forthe mean how do we find the mean I'llgive you a clue it's a fractionokay so you said a couple of thingsthere and they kind of sort of geltogether and the me is also called theaverage but the way to find an averageis to add up all the scores so that'syour Sun and everything you divide by abetter you mentioned was how many scoresdo you have so if the solar scoresdivided by the number of scores I'vewritten it in this particular waybecause you'll find this exact learningon the formula - you add up all three ofthese this is the only one that's therebut that's okay because if you thinkabout the other two and theirdefinitions you don't need a formulavariety of it as the right sense themedian is that it's the middle spot nowI actually want to give you a slightlybetter definition for that it's a scoresuch that there's the same number ofscores above you and the same numberscores below you then write that andthen on why I think this is a betterdefinition it's a score such thatthere's the same number above as belowokay now the reason why I put this outis that remembering the middle is a goodidea for like remembering the concept ofit but the problem is saying the medianis the middle school is that there isn'talways a middle school let me give you aquick example maybe you want to cut thisdown to.5 get another color here's theset of scores which is the middle schoolFrancienow there there isn't a middle score isthere right because you'd say well themiddle score is life in between yearssome ways it's not this value and it'snot this guy's it's somewhere in themiddle right exactly so what I have todo is I have to say it's the mean it'sthe average of the middle scores sothat's why the middle is like a sort ofshorthand definition but it's not alwaysthe middle school because there isn'talways small so in this case it would be3 plus 6 on to which we've mentioned is4 o'clock okay so you need to know whatthe mean is to find out what the me okaywhat's the motorokay most frequently okay now we've gotthem in this order is a career double ror 1 hours the glades is it - ok let'sfix itum I've got them in this order becausethis is roughly speaking the order thatyou'll find them the most frequentlyoccurring actually the average theaverage is the one you see over and overagain the meeting comes up next and thenthe mode is the least common one okay sowhat unpack why that is why is it likethis so let me pull up I have aspreadsheet here I'm gonna show you herewe go ok so here's some scores okaynow I didn't mention why I've given thishandy right you might have seen it inthe textbook this phrase the reason whywe call all of these measures of centraltendency is because their ways are sayhey in a group like a group of people orin a group of scores what's the centerof the group what would be considerednormal in this group okay so you can seeif you squint really hard you'll see abunch of scores on the left it's notthat important but each one of them isrepresented by a column and then thisred line is the average okay now have alook would you say that's a fair summaryof where the middle of the group iswhere the center that's seminary thereyeslook this a bunch of Bob a bunch ofbelow and they're about the samedistance so I'm happy with thatokay now these are scores here you cansee I've actually calculated the mean upthere in the top left you can see it inthe yellow box to that 23,000 266 I justfashioned some numbers that could be mykind of part-time small income type jobsand the annual income that you've gotnow these are all in the sort of twentythousands and I've ranked them so youcan see I've got the lowest income therein nineteen thousand and this one here's28,000 now this is the average I meanit's fine so far but watch what happensif I take the UM the biggest burner herewho's got 28,000 just give them a littlebit of a raise okay let's say he gets abig race okay now have a look at what'shappened right I've I've def coupletheir income so now it's 280,000 which Ishould point out is still not that crazythere's plenty of people in that countryburn this anemone okay now have a lookat the data and have a look at what'shappened to the mean in fact you canhave a look at in two ways you got thenumber at the top and you also got thered line okay it's the mean a gooddescription of the center of this groupit's not a lizard right because if youhave a look it's almost three thirty twothousand dollars right and you can seethe next person after our $280,000 thenext person's like twenty-sevenso every single person in our groupexcept for one has an income that's waybelow this mean it's not a gooddescription of the center and all okayin fact the mean is only useful ifyou've got data kind of like this wecall it a normally distributed sotherefore if you have another color redwould be probably the most usable you'regoing to be careful with the men rightthe reason you've got to be careful isbecause it's influenced by really reallyhigh or really low scores like the one Ijust showed you we have a special namefor these kinds of scores it starts withtheir poems I don't know they werecalled outliers so the more outliers youhave and the more extreme they are themore you influence things like this andby the way the reason I picked outincome is because world incomes areexactly like this you've got a hugenumber of people who have this small netincome that are very tall the amount ofpeople small amount of people on earththe one percent who are outliers andthey throw up so you use this in mostcases but if you got outliers if you'vegot them skewed data you're kind of introubleso using the median now I want to showyou when the median is more useful herewe goso here's some data that doesn't reallyhave outliers is the way I describedbefore okay but you see it's kind ofleaning towards one side mister theseare the scores going higher and higherand higher this way so most people areon the negative end of the spectrum okaynow does anyone remember this is calleda skew population does anyone rememberwhat kind of skew it is huhnow this is such a sneaky thing we'regoing to spend some more time on thisbut I thought since I'm showing you thepicture I might as well return to itthis is actually positively skewed it'skind of like yeah it's really sneaky sothe way I remember it is you've got atail here you see that right you've gota hump here this big cluster of peopleand then you've got a tail when you talkabout which way something is skewedyou're actually referring to which waythe tail isokay so the tail is facing in thepositive direction this is positive skewokay now because you've got lots ofpeople sort of going up in really highvalues they're taking them mean they'redragging it up in exactly the same waythat's this guy let's make the changeagain in exactly the same way that thisfinal score is dragging the mean upwardsokay so over here all of these guys aredragging the mean over there but looklook at where most of the people arethis is a much better the median this isa much better description of what thecenter of the group is okay it's anotheruseful thing you can say so this istalking about the median now it's usefulfor skewed data like that it's alsoreally useful if you think back to thisdiagram do you remember we talked aboutfour different kinds of data fordifferent kinds of data some of the dataonly some of the data can be averagedright have a think what are the kinds ofDoug do you remember the video okay goodcategorical it starts with a cube verygood numbers underneath let's go backwhat to do first I think plugs in is tootightyep separate ones like one two threefour five use when you measure somethinglike heights and weights or whatever andthen under categorical the word onceagain is to organize or than all whichmeans is an or like you know worst okaybest and then okay so good job when youhave a look at something like say thesefacts right these guys are okay foraverages you can average them out justfine but if you have a look at somethinglike this I mentioned like the qualityof an object right so really terriblesort of okay neutral etc how are yougoing to average something like thatthey're words you can't average wordsthat's the whole problem with this wholeset but you can take a median of wordsyou can tell which one the middle wordis that's where are you getting all yourscoreokay so it's useful for skewed data orcategoricalokay and that's gonna be my last momentto speak about this last one remembersays the least common again it's aboutthe data type right so I've already saidthese two are okay because you couldtake the aberrations this guy's okaybecause you can take the view what's thefavoryeah this is like okay by coloryou can't average it out you can't saythere's a middle by color me though whynot yeah like to get them to get them ina whoopsie daisies to get them intosomething like this I had to have themranked did you notice that I had to gofrom lowest to highestthey said job if you can't order themyou can't find a median because it'svery middle so therefore from thisnominal dataphenomenal data the mode is the onlything you can usebut most are way looking at that we'reinterested is not nominal that's whythis one comes up less frequently okay
