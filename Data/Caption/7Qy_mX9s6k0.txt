oh the class work no no that's notthat's just practice just actuallypracticing your notes so ladies andgentlemen I talked about there's twoformulas that we talked about does ittwo farmers have talked about the sum ofinterior angles is n minus two times 180that's for a polygon the measure of oneinterior angle is n minus two times 180divided by n right so in this problemthey say that one angle is worth 100 or100 has the measurement of 108 degreesso which formula do you think I'm goingto want to use the sum of all the anglesor the measure of one angle thus measureof one angle because that they give usthe measurement of that one angle so I'mnot going to worry about that in sothere's telling us pretty much the sameas the measure of one angle is equal tothat I so what I'm going to do is I'mgoing to say all right 108 I equals nminus 2 times 180 divided by n and thenwhat they're asking us is find thenumber of sides so what represents thenumber of sides and n represents numbersides right so I need to solve for n nowguys going back to your algebra 1 classwe're solving for a variable we have toget that variable isolated right byitself well the first thing we need todo is we need to get off the denominatorso how can I get it off of thedenominator what inverse operation can Iuse amber multiplied by n on both sidesrightso what I'll do is I'll multiply by n onboth sides therefore I have 108 n equalsn minus 2 times 180 degrees because ndivided by n just goes into 1 now what Ican do is I can apply the distributiveproperty therefore I have 108 N equals180 and minus 360 okay and now we have avariable on both sides so to get thevariable to get the variable off bothsides we have to go and add or subtractto get them on the same side now usuallywhat I like to do late in gentlemen isyou know we can just subtract this oversubtract this over to there just to getthem on to the same side and that's whatI'll do I'll subtract 180 n thereforethat's going to give me a negative 72and equals negative 360 yesyou can it there's you could subtractthe 108 over there and then add 360 tothe other side there's not a problemwith that either but it doesn't itdoesn't have to be one way or the otheryou can really choose then I'll justdivide by negative 72 and therefore Nequals anybody anybody well what is 7times 5 35 so step 5 times 70 would be350 then you have a 2 5 times 2 is 10360 so N equals 5therefore if every individual angle isequal to 108 degrees if each individualangle is equal to 108 degrees you thenhave a what do we name a five sidedfigure Pentagon very good no it'spositive because a negative
