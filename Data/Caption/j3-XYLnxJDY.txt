So right here, we have
a four-sided figure,or a quadrilateral,
where two of the sidesare parallel to each other.And so this, by
definition, is a trapezoid.And what we want to do
is, given the dimensionsthat they've given us, what
is the area of this trapezoid.So let's just think through it.So what would we get if we
multiplied this long base6 times the height 3?So what do we get if
we multiply 6 times 3?Well, that would be the
area of a rectangle thatis 6 units wide
and 3 units high.So that would give us
the area of a figure thatlooked like-- let me do
it in this pink color.The area of a figure that looked
like this would be 6 times 3.So it would give us this
entire area right over there.Now, the trapezoid is
clearly less than that,but let's just go with
the thought experiment.Now, what would happen if
we went with 2 times 3?Well, now we'd be finding
the area of a rectangle thathas a width of 2
and a height of 3.So you could imagine that being
this rectangle right over here.So that is this rectangle
right over here.So that's the 2
times 3 rectangle.Now, it looks like the
area of the trapezoidshould be in between
these two numbers.Maybe it should be exactly
halfway in between,because when you look at the
area difference between the tworectangles-- and let
me color that in.So this is the area difference
on the left-hand side.And this is the area difference
on the right-hand side.If we focus on
the trapezoid, yousee that if we start with the
yellow, the smaller rectangle,it reclaims half
of the area, halfof the difference between
the smaller rectangleand the larger one on
the left-hand side.It gets exactly half of
it on the left-hand side.And it gets half the
difference between the smallerand the larger on
the right-hand side.So it completely makes
sense that the areaof the trapezoid, this
entire area right over here,should really just
be the average.It should exactly be
halfway between the areasof the smaller rectangle
and the larger rectangle.So let's take the average
of those two numbers.It's going to be 6 times 3 plus
2 times 3, all of that over 2.So when you think about
an area of a trapezoid,you look at the two bases, the
long base and the short base.Multiply each of those times
the height, and then youcould take the average of them.Or you could also
think of it as thisis the same thing as 6 plus 2.And I'm just factoring
out a 3 here.6 plus 2 times 3, and
then all of that over 2,which is the same
thing as-- and I'mjust writing it
in different ways.These are all different
ways to think about it--6 plus 2 over 2, and
then that times 3.So you could view
it as the averageof the smaller and
larger rectangle.So you multiply each of
the bases times the heightand then take the average.You could view it as-- well,
let's just add up the two baselengths, multiply that times the
height, and then divide by 2.Or you could say, hey, let's
take the average of the twobase lengths and
multiply that by 3.And that gives you
another interesting wayto think about it.If you take the average of these
two lengths, 6 plus 2 over 2is 4.So that would be a width
that looks somethinglike-- let me do this in orange.A width of 4 would look
something like this.A width of 4 would look
something like that,and you're multiplying
that times the height.Well, that would be a rectangle
like this that is exactlyhalfway in between
the areas of the smalland the large rectangle.So these are all
equivalent statements.Now let's actually
just calculate it.So we could do any of these.6 times 3 is 18.This is 18 plus 6, over 2.That is 24/2, or 12.You could also do it this way.6 plus 2 is 8, times 3 is
24, divided by 2 is 12.6 plus 2 divided by 2
is 4, times 3 is 12.Either way, the area of this
trapezoid is 12 square units.
