so first of all you want to know how tograph the tangent graph y equals tangentof X and that's what I have here and thekey thing to remember with the you knowthese graphs is that they repeat so forexample I could draw another cycle ofthe tangent and the same thing over hereit would also you know go like this overhere so it keeps repeating but the waythat it stands now is that the inverseof this graph is not a function becauseit fails the horizontal line test rightso if you draw a horizontal line it'sactually intersecting the graph at morethan one point so what mathematiciansdecided to do is to restrict the domainokay when they're graphing our tangentand they're restricting the domain fromnegative PI over 2 to positive PI over 2this just happens to be one period oftangent but in this fashion now it'sonly going to you know the horizontalline is only going to cross the graph atmost once so that means it passes ahorizontal line test the inverse of thegraph is a function and we can now youknow analyze it so what we're gonna dohere when you find the inverse of agraph is you interchange the X and the yvalues or the x and the y coordinatesand that's what we're gonna do here toget the graph of arctangent now thefirst thing I want to do is just labelthese points so this point over herenegative PI over 4 comma negative 1let's just go ahead and label thatnegative PI over 4 comma negative 1we're gonna interchange those values sonow we're gonna be graphing negative 1comma negative PI over 4 now PI isapproximately 3 right so that means thisis about negative 3 fourths okay so I'mjust gonna approximate this to help usgraph it negative 1 negative 3 fourthsthis point here at the origin that'seasy that's 0 0 ok and then this pointover here PI over 4 comma 1 which isabout again about 3/4 comma 1 so whatwe're going to do is we're going tointerchange these values so 1 comma 3 40 0 that's already switched and negative1 negative 3 fourths so let's go aheadand plot those so where is negative 1well negative 1 would be right abouthere okay and then negative 3 fourths isgoing to be right about here so I'm justgoing to put put that point there 0 0 isgoing to be right where it is right nowand then 1 commathree force is going to be right abouthere and right about here okay now thenext thing I'm going to do is I'm goingto take these vertical asymptotes andwhen you reflect these verticalasymptotes over the line y equals x this45-degree linewhat you end up getting is instead of avertical line you end up getting ahorizontal line so these asymptotes endup becoming horizontal asymptotes andthey're going to be up here at PI overtwo which is about one point five sevenso I'm just going to put them rightright about here okay and right about atnegative one point five seven so that'sgoing to be right about like that so nowwhat we're going to do is we're gonnagraph our tangent inverse graph it'sgoing to look something like let's seehere it's going to look like this andwhat you'll notice is that it's areflection over this line y equals x soif I sketch this in here okay this liney equals x so it's a slope of 1 and youcan see that the original graph okay ourtangent our original graph which lookedlike this is being reflected over thatline and here's our tangent inversegraph like this so that's how you graphthe arc tangent of the tangent inversejust take those x and y valuesinterchange them and then also make sureto take those asymptotes and reflectthem over the line y equals x you getthese horizontal asymptotes up here atPI over 2 and negative PI over 2 andyou've got it so I hope you enjoyed thisvideo subscribe to the channel check outmore math tutoring videos on my youtubechannel Mira's math tutoring and I lookforward to helping you in the futurevideos I'll talk to you soon
