geometric mean okay the geometric meanare these two values and the extremesare these two values and there'ssomething called the means extremesproperty you probably know it as thecross multiplication where this productequals this product okay but what we'regoing to do here is we're going to solvefor the altitude or one of these piecesof the hypotenuse when you drop analtitude to the hypotenuse of a righttriangle it splits this hypotenuse intotwo parts a and B and what happens isyou hand up with three similar trianglesa small one this medium one and thisover all right triangle and thesetriangles are all similar to one anotherthe corresponding angles are congruentthe corresponding sides are going to beproportional and what happens is you endup having a proportion that you can setup this triangle and this triangle orthe triangle is really compared and I'lljust show you real quick if you takethis triangle okay and you rotate it andyou take this triangle and you rotate itso you have them in the same orientationsame direction here you've got a and thealtitude here you've got V and thealtitude and you can see you can set upa proportion so a is 2 the altitude asthe altitude is to B so you're comparingthe base to the base as the height is tothe height so these two triangles aresimilar so the corresponding sides areproportionalbut practicality just practicallyspeaking how do we use this well let'sgo over here and look at some examplesif we want to find this altitude here Xall we do is we set up a proportion wesay 4 is 2 X as X is 2 9 so the altitudeokay that's the geometric mean that'sthese guys these are the means these arethe extremes4 & 9 cross multiply so you get xsquared equals 36 and take the squareroot of both sides and you get x equals6 so that's going to be the altitudeokay this one same thing we have a righttriangle we drop an altitudeto the hypotenuse to the base here thisaltitude splits the hypotenuse up intotwo pieces axon 16 so we know that allthree of these triangles formed aresimilar so we can set up a proportion sosame thing access to 8 as 8 is 216 okayso again you can see the altitude is themean okay these are the means and theseare the extremes so if we cross multiplywe get 16 x equals 64 divided by 16 andwe get 4okay last example sometimes what peopledo is they'll give you this whole lengthso by taking 29 minus 25 we see thatthis is 4okay and let's just verify that thisworks so you can see that 4 is 210 as 10is 225 100 equals 100 so you can see thealtitude here is the geometric mean ofthe two parts of the hypotenuse that itdivides it up into
