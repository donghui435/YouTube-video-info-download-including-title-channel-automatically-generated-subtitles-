hi this is Mario with Mario's mathtutoring coming to the another mathvideo to help you boost your score inyour math class improve yourunderstanding and hopefully makelearning math a lot less stressful sowhat we're going to talk about in thisvideo is how to write summations inSigma notation so a lot of timesstudents have questions about this likehow do you write a sum okay okay like aseries a sequence by the way is just alist of numbers a series is a sum andwhat we want to do is we want to writethis summation okay this is the sum ofall these numbers in a more compact formand that's what we call the Sigmanotation this Greek letter here is Sigmaokay and what you do is you you want topick a variable okay this is your indexhere I've said I equals 1 meaning I'mstarting at the first term is going tobe I equals 1 and I'm gonna work my wayup sequentially okay in order until Iget to the nth term that's the last termso I'll show you what I mean let's takea look at some examples so in this firstexample notice what's happening herewe're adding two each time to get to thenext term so we need a formula for anyterm in this sequence so what I'm goingto do here is I'm going to use thearithmetic ok sequence formula andbasically what this is is the first termplus the common difference times n minus1 okay so the first term is 3 but wekeep adding 2 n minus 1 times so this isgoing to be 2 n minus 2 plus 3 which is2 n plus 1 and you can test that out youcan see when that is 1 you're getting 3if n is you know 4 you're getting 9 andso on okay so this is working withsequences in series I have some othervideos I'll have some links for that foryou to check out but the main thing hereis how do we write this in this compactSigma notation well we have a formula tofind any term that's 2n plus 1 okay andwe're going to say that N equals 1 1 2 34 5 6 7 8 terms 2 8 okay now you'reprobably saying well why are usingletter n well you can use any letter youwant you could rewrite this asI equals 1 to 8 of 2 I plus 1 you couldsay K equals 1 to 8 of 2 k plus 1 butnotice that whatever variable I'm usinghere I'm using here ok so I I and andand so on so that I I know and whensomebody looks at this they know thatokay I start with 1 I put 1 in 2 times 1is 2 plus 1 is 3 plus the cave the Greekletter e Sigma this means summation whenwe use we're adding these up now I put 2in for K that's 2 times 2 is 4 plus 1 is5 and I keep working my way until I getto this top number 8 I put 8 and I get16 plus 1 is 17 and then I add all thosetogether ok so right now we're justpracticing running it as a summationokay so the next one what's the patternhere like how am I getting from thisterm to this term for this term and soonokay so we're multiplying by 1/2 rightso what we're gonna do is we're gonnastart off we're going to say our formulais 100 okay times 1/2 we'll say I minus1 times so you start off with a hundredyou multiply a by 1/2 by half by half soif I wanted to get to the one two threefourth term I actually have to multiplyby 1/2 once twice three times which isone less than the actual term that I'mon turn number four so I equals 1 andwhat's the top number here well if yousaid infinity you're right because thiskeeps going see the ellipsis the threedots that just means it keeps going okayso this is just gonna be an infiniteseries okay it just goes on and on andon alright last example this one here itactually doesn't fit the arithmeticpattern where you're adding orsubtracting the same thing each timedoesn't fit the geometric pattern whereyou're multiplying or dividing by thesame thing each time this one is justits own unique pattern and you can seeit's one half plus two-thirds plusthree-fourths so on and so forth butnotice how the numerator keeps going upby 1 and the denominator keeps going upby one so what we're going to do iswe're going to write this like so we'regoing to say that the n over n plus 1that's our formula for any termand N equals 1 to 99 because you can seethe first term N equals 1 second term nequals 2 all the way to the 99th turnany N equals 99 and then the denominatoris always one more than the numerator sothat's why we have n plus 1 and so thisis just a compact representation of howto write this summation ok this serieswhich is the sum of terms and a nicecompact form so I hope you enjoyed thisvideo I hope you learned somethingsubscribe to the channel check out someof my past videos and I'll see you inthe next video
