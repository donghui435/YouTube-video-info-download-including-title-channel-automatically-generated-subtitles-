welcomeI realize have been remiss and havemissed some numbers in my suite ofvideos on divisibility rules examplehave done a video explained thatdivisibility rule by nine and by threeI've done rule one rule explaining thatis new by seven and another one byeleven I've even done two visitor rulesfor numbers 19 and 17 and 51 and 147losses of weird numbers dozen bitter wasall straightforward numbers like one twofour five six dawn and there's stillstuff to think of here so it's worthgoing through them so let me just finishup the super videos of divisibilityrules but go through the remainingnumbers he goes let's the number oneit's fairly straightforward every numberis W is divisible by 1 so all numbersdivisible by that's it that's mypossibly rule everything works allnumbers does about one straightforwardrate next numberslet me lump it together a rule for 2 5and 10 I think about what you know mostpeople say a number is two bills but itsfinal digit is 0 2 4 6 or 8 that's howwe did to fight even numbers and mostpeople realize that numbers rose by 5 ifand only if its final digit is either a0 or 5 and most people check the diseaseif I deposited by 10 by checking thefinal digit see if it's a 0 so thesethree numbers seem to have the same rulecheck the final digit and then deducesomething from that so why would 2 5 and10 kind of follow the same two visiblyraw some sort let's do it let me focuson the visit by two first all sort of dothe expression all three in one hit soany number like you know six thousandeight hundred and forty-seven can bethought of as a multiple ten 6840 plus asingle digit and that single did ofcourse the final did the number and thenice thing about multiples at an effectlet me make it explicit six eight fourtimes ten plus the final single digit isthat we know that ten itself was alreadymore to in fact any multiple terms canbe developed by two so this part ofnumbers or makers are by two is thereanything we need to check is the finaldigit for delivery by divisibility bytwo all rightso richard possible final digitsdivisible by two well 0 if it's of zeroat thethat videos about two or two is it asingle digit divisible by twofours a single digits by two so 1/6 sois 8 by the way 7 isn't so it turns outsix eight four sevens not model or twobut there it is so check for dessert viaby to just check at the final digitsdivisible by 2 or check the final digitsone of these nice numbers we recognizethere's two visited by two by the samereasoning being say we want to check thedivisibility by five what a multiple of10 is already multiple files that'staken care of so order to do is check tosee if the final digit is a multiple offive well don't you think of two singledigits they could be that addedmultiples of five namely zero and fivethat the only two single digits that themodels are five so to check your fournumbers bills by five check at the finaldue to the multiple five that is checkthe final digit is a zero of five by theway 7 isn't so 6003 seven is notdivisible by five but that explains thewhole pot by five in general and finallydigitally by ten bought multiple ten isalready a multiple attempts that part ofthem is taken care of all we need tocheck is the final digit is the finaldigit a multiple of ten well chosethere's only one possible final digitthat is a multiple of ten namely zero soone way to check if another small or tenis check if the final digit happens tobe zero itself the only option we haveparticiper ten that explains to visit byten greatlet me move along the number for thevisit we wall for four is actually goingto follow a very similar principle andmost people christen space here mostpeople know the rule for this they sayand numbers divisible by four if it'sfinal two digits represent a number thatis a multiple for example I didsomething like I don't know fivethousand at 972 they say is look at thefinal two digits 72 as his own numberand see if that's multiple for well niceway to see same is multiple for see askyou have it a couple of times I can haveit once and get 36 I can have it againand get 18 yep I could have it twicethat means 72 is a mobile four whichmeans apparently the original number isa mobile four why does that workwell they do the same sort of trick aswe did before this time to focus onmultiples of a hundred every number canbe written as a marble of 100 plus afinal two-digit sources 5032 is 350 900plus 72 and to be clear 5959 times ahundred plus 72 well a hundred isalready multiple four it's four timestwenty-five any mobile of a hundred istherefore could be taken care of hisalready mortal form no need to checkthis part of the number so any departlemme need to check as the final twodigits so number services by four if itsfinal two digits represent a number thatcan be hard twice great there's thedivisionary rule for four in fact infact in fact let's go straight to eightnow just eight and even sixteen for thesame ideasso the below by eight people say ischeck the final three due to some numberfor example it's check might be rightnumber like 18 thousand two hundred andseventy-six this is a multiple of athousand plus a final three digits andwhy people multiply first about athousand this time well this is reallyeighteen times a thousand plus 276 andif you like I don't think if this is 18times 10 times 10 times 10 that's amultiple to let's go to in it this tensgot a two in it and this 10 has atwo-minute so 10 times 10 times 10 has a2 times 2 times 2 it mainly is a mobileof 8 so a thousand is already a multipleof 8 so that means to chill three digitsand can I can I divide 236 and a halfthree times let's see I bet again 138that's once gonna do it again 65 plusfor 69 that's twice I do it again oh no276 is not divisible by 8 which means18,200 676 is not visible by 8 so therule for the visit by the 8 is justcheck the final three numbers of numbersthey can be have to thrice then bingoyour which number was a multiple of 8 sothat means if disney rule 516 is gonnabe very similarlet me clear the screenthis time focus on multiples of 10,000 Iknow I'm making up a number of thoseeight seven six to focus on the finalfour digits because the rest of itoops eight would be four zeros plus thefinal four digits seven six - that'sreally 10 times 10 times 10 times 10that has a 200 that is a 200 that is a 2and it that is a 2 and it which meansthis was all the multiple of 16 it isall that's already a multiple 16 takingcare of it so all we need to check onall four digits do they represent anumber that's a mobile 16 you know howbut once for or goshen I'm thinkingmaybe three three eight one can have atwice nopethis number is not the model 16 and offwe go and then we get divisible by 30 tocheck the final five digits it was by 3264 check the final six digits so on andthen finally finally all these inbetween numbers like a six and twelveand fifteen or a weskit 15 and 14 don'twatch get 14 just then six most peoplelike to believe that prime numbers are--have in a beautiful way but ifsomething is divisible by two andsomething's also do this by three thatguarantees is to build by six which casejust use the divisible rule for two anddoesn't reward for three a number isdivisible by six if its digits some tomultiple through it is multiple threeand spinal digits either 0 2 4 6 or 8 anumber is a multiple of 12 excuse me itwas by 3 and it stirs up by 4 peoplelike to believe that numbers with nocommon factors behave that way so itsdigits so a number suppose by 12 is ifits digits some term or both of 3 andits final two digits can be have twice15 is 3 times 5 and numbers multiple of15 if it's a sum it is somethingimmortal 3 and its final digit is either0 or 5 the zoo rule for 45 which is 9times 5 its digits needs some time offfor fun 9farm digit needs to be a 0 or 5 etc etcthat's it we've now captured alldivisibility rules for all numbersthrough all these videos that may be abit fast but there we go now there's oneother thing here this is all based onten base ten the fact that ten is dulledby two and five and ten made thedivision rules for these numbers 2 5 and10 kind of special I am to know thatMartians have six fingers on two handsso they're not like us they're not veryhuman they didn't think ten for theirnumber systems they think 12 for theirnumber systems so my puzzle for you as Ileave office all will be the divisionaryrules if all numbers would work withwere written in base 12 and given that12 is three times four and it's alsoequal to 12 a bit that divisible rulesfor three four and twelve are very nicein the system a bit the division rulesfor other numbers a bit awkward how doyou tell if numbers does by five in base12 it's my real puzzle can you work thatout things would be gone all right lotsof fun thanks so much
