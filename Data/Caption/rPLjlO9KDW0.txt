the number E is defined as the limitwhen X approaches infinity of 1 plus 1over X to the X this number was somefirst introduced by John Napier he alsosigned as Knepper and he used thisnumber as the base of the natural logsnatural logs John Napier was thediscoverer or inventor of logarithms nowif you're wondering what is thisexpression approaching you may do thislittle test give values to X and findthe values of 1 plus 1 over X to the Xso for example if you give X value 1then this would be 1 plus 1 over 1 tothe first power and of course that'sgoing to give you 2 now if you increaseX to let's say 10 then this expressionbecomes 1 plus 1 over 10 to the 10 andif you do that with a calculator you'regonna get two point five nine threeseven four two four six a bunch ofnumbers let's say that you dramaticallyincrease that to let's say 1,000 so theexpression becomes 1 plus 1 over 1,000to the 1000 and if you do that with acalculator you're going to get two pointseven one six nine two three nine andwhole bunch of other digits now let'ssay that you keep drastically increasingthis number let's say that X is now100,000 so this is one plus one over100,000 raised to the 100,000 power ifyou bothered to do that with acalculator you're going to get two pointseven one eight two six eight two threeseven okay so we see that when we keepincreasing this more and more and morethe number doesn't keep increasingdrastically the same as X as a matter offact we see that some numbers startrepeating right the two of course wehave it there and then here we have theseven and here we have a seven and wehave the 1 and the 1 and let's say thatyou do one more step let's say that youdo 10 million 10 million then this wouldbe 1 plus 1 over 10 million raised tothe 10 million and what we get with acalculator is 2.71828 1/6 and a wholebunch of other digits right so we seethat this 8 we also get it again and thetwo okay so um you can spend the rest ofyour life doing this and never exactlycalculate a e is an irrational number soyou cannot find it exactly just as picannot be found exactly now um this isnot the only expression that you willbump into that gives you IIif we dothis substitution for example we callone over X if we call it you then thatmeans that X would be 1 over u ok so ifwe apply this substitution in thisexpression then e will be the limit offinstead of 1 plus 1 over X instead of 1plus 1 over X we are going to have 1plus u and instead of having X at thetop we're going to have 1 over u ok nowbefore we have that X was approachinginfinity but when X approaches infinityyou will approach 0 so that means that Eis also the limit you can use U or X orany other variable it doesn't thevariable that you choose it doesn'tmatter so the limit when X approaches 0of 1 plus X to the 1 over X that is alsoe okay we could also do anothersubstitution instead of doing thissubstitution if we call 1 plus 1 over Xif we call it 1 over u then that meansthat 1 over X would be 1 over u minus 1and if you subtract these twoexpressions you're going to get 1 minusu over u and that means that X if 1 overX is equal to this if you flip this twofractions you're going to get that X isgoing to be equal to u over- you okay so that means that E is alsothe limit of what instead of having 1plus 1 over X we're going to have 1 overu and instead of having the exponent Xwe're going to have you over 1 minus unow when X approaches infinity if Xapproaches infinity this expression isgoing to approach 0 and then 1 over u isgoing to be equal to 1 which means thatwhat you is going to be able to 1 so Uis approaching 1 therefore this is alsoe so e can also we can also write it asa limit when X approaches 1 of 1 over Xraised to the x over 1 minus X and youmay bump into any of this expression soit's useful to remember try to memorizethis when you're calculating limits ordoing any other thing in calculus whenyou see that limit know that that is ebut you could also bump into this formof E or that form you probably havealready seen E when studying exponentialfunctions natural logs compound interestand if you do probability you will alsosee many uses of T and of course indifferential and integral calculus
