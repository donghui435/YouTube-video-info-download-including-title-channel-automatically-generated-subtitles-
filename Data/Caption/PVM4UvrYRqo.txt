McCaul I have no ideahow to calculate that area but what I doknow how to calculate is the area of atriangle so if I divide this hexagoninto congruent triangles and they'll allbe congruent because it's regular thenall I have to do is add up the area ofmy six triangles so you could say thearea of the hexagon is equal to sixtimes the area of one of those trianglesbut how do we calculate the area of oneof those triangles well if you recall inorder to calculate the area of atriangle you need two things you needthe base and its corresponding height sothat's why we need the apothem is theapothem is that corresponding height sospecifically for a polygon we're goingto call this a and we're going to callthat base s where if we go back here sis our side length so notice that thesides will all be the same for a regularpolygon so the area of this triangle isgoing to be the apothem which is theheight so I'm going to say six times theapothem times the base which is sdivided by two so the area of a hexagonis equal to six times the area of one ofyour triangles but that's not veryuseful because this is only going toapply to a hexagon so let's make thisarea formula for any type of polygon soinstead of writing six I'm going towrite n for the number of sides so I canwrite this as apothem times side lengthtimes the number sides all divided bytwonow if we look at this I see that I cansimplify this a little bit more gettingback to our regular polygon theperimeter capital P of this polygon isgoing to be one two three four five sixs if I have a Pentagon that would befive s so what I'm going to do is I'mgoing to say that the perimeter of anyregular polygon is n times s so I cansubstitute in for n times s capital Pwhich is going to stand for perimeter sothere's gonna be two ways to write yourarea formula and I'm going to erase thisto make it a little bit clearer here sowe're gonna say the area of any regularpolygon is equal to apothem times sidelength times the number of sides dividedby two or if we substitute in for ntimes s it's gonna be the apothem timesthe perimeter / - so you have twodifferent formulas both of which willcalculate the area of any regularpolygon and by - I can't do this withyou - laughing back there so if we hadno that's not right three co-playerpoints so have you ever gotten up theairplane that should be yeah dang itlike five hundred degrees in here whatalright when you're in chemistry classthey're gonna be dealing a lot of workyou're gonna do the funny ever so as anexample we can consider like you've gota chain hanging from 200 to fix
