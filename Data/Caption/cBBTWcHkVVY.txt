Alice and Bob have figured
out an amazing trick.They're exchanging
messages by pluckinga wire either hard or soft to
transmit a zero versus a one.However, due to gusts of
wind, false zeros or onescan occur during transmission,
resulting in errors.Though they figured out a
way to communicate errorfree, even in the
presence of noise.How could they do this?In the 1940s, Richard Hamming
faced a similar problemwhile working at
Bell Laboratories.At the Bell Telephone
Laboratories, we do about 10%of the experiments on a
computer, and about 90%in the laboratory.Highly expected in time we will
do 90% on the computer and 10%in the lab.Speed, cost, and effort
favor the computerover the laboratory approach.At the time, the computers
used stored informationon punch cards representing
one versus zerowith hole versus no hole.This system was error prone,
because it was common for cardsto get bent or mis punched
in the first place.So holes could be
missed or no holescould be accidentally
punctured, causing flipped bits.These errors would
cause the entire systemto halt until the error location
could be found and correctedmanually.So Hamming took it upon himself
to devise a method whichcould automatically detect
and correct single biterrors without
interrupting calculations.His solution was rooted in the
intuitive idea of repetition,something we all do when
faced with interference,or the chance that part of
our message will be corrupted.His error correcting
codes were builton the simple concept
of a parity bit.A parity it is a
single bit whichis added to the end of
a message and indicateswhether the number of ones in
the message is even or odd.If a single error
occurs, the receivercan then detect it
because the paritybit will no longer match.However, to detect and
correct single errors,Hamming needed to
add more parity bitsto identify the error location.This leads to his seven four
code, which adds three paritybits to each block of
four data bits as follows.First, we start with
the three parity bits,which can be
represented by a circle.Now, these circles intersect
to produce four regions,and the four data
bits are placedinside these regions
in a specific order.Now, to calculate
the parity bits,we look at each
circle one at a time,each containing three data bits.We determine the
parity bit as before.Add up the data bits, and
if we get zero or two,the parity bit is zero for even,
and if we get one or three,the parity is one for odd.And we do this for all circles,
and end up with three paritybits to match the
four data bits.These are then placed in a
standard sequence as follows.Realize now this system
can automaticallycorrect single errors
with a simple rule.If a single character occurs,
two or more of the parity bitswill be incorrect, and
wherever they intersectis the location of the error.This intersecting data bit
is then flipped automaticallyso that all parity
bits are valid again.And this is Alice
and Bob's trick,the additional parity bits
are known as redundant bits,because they don't carry
any new information.And all air correction codes
work this way, they allincrease the size of
the source messagesslightly at the expense of
automatically correctingerrors.We also use error correcting
codes for storage, for example,on a physical CD,
the informationis encoded using special codes
to correct for chunks of errorscaused by scratches or dust,
which corrupt longer sequencesof zeros and ones
stored on the surface.This is why you can
scratch a CD and often itwill still play perfectly.Claude Shannon used
this idea of redundancyto redefine the capacity
of a communication channel,because as the noise on
your channel increases,we must increase the
amount of redundancyto communicate error
free, and this must thendecrease the effective
amount of informationyou can send per unit time.
