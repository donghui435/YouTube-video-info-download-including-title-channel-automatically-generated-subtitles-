okay in this video I just want to talkabout finding slant asymptotes ofrational functions and not all rationalfunctions have slant asymptotes thecondition for a rational function tohave a slant asymptote it occurs whenthe degree of the numerator is onelarger than the degree of thedenominator so I've got a few here thatall have slant asymptotes I've got xsquared plus 1 over X minus 4 thenumerators degree to the denominatorsdegree 1 that would have a slantasymptote likewise for the middle onethe degree of the numerator is 3 thedegree of the denominator is 2 thatwould have a slant asymptote andlikewise for this one at the end X thedegree of the numerator is to the 100thpower the degree of the denominator isto the 99th power so that would alsohave a slant asymptote I'm actuallygoing to find the slant asymptote to thefirst two and just to remind you againwhat is a slant asymptote a slantasymptote is just a line here the line Ihave is got positive slope it couldcertainly have negative slope and allthat happens is you could you could havevertical asymptotes as well butbasically for large values of X thefunction will get closer and closer tothat slant asymptote and then likewisefor as you go to negative infinity thefunction will get close to that slantasymptote it will start hugging thatline so maybe I can make it get a littlebit closer here okay the way that youfind it is we do long division so ifyou've forgotten long division ofpolynomials here's going to be a littlereview I certainly have separate videosjust specifically dedicated to longdivision of polynomials if you do asearch on that you can find it if youneed to see a couplefor examples but let's just find theslant asymptotes of you know these firsttwo so let's look at x squared plus 1over X minus 4 we'll do that one firstso to do long division okayso the thing on top is what goesunderneath x squared again I like tomake a little placeholder notice there'sno X to the first term so I'm just goingto write 0x plus 1 and then on theoutside I have X minus 4 I like to putthat in parentheses just to remindmyself to distribute just good for myguess so we're going to do long divisionI think x times what is going to give mex squared well I would need an X to thefirst power and then we just multiply sox times X is going to be x squared xtimes negative 4 is going to give usnegative 4x okay and then we subtractthe X Squared's will cancel we'll get 0X minus negative 4x which is going togive us positive 4x we'll drop down theplus 1 and now we can do one more stepso I think x times what is 4x wellpositive 4 and again we do the samething we multiply four times X will giveus 4x 4 times negative 4 is going to benegative 16 again if we subtract we'llget it looks like positive 17 this isgoing to be our remainderand what that says is it says well thenwe can write the function x squared plus1 the rational function x squared plus 1over X minus 4 it says we can write thatas X plus 4 that's what we got on topplus the remainder which is 17 butor X minus four okay so our remaindergoes on top whatever you were dividingby goes on the bottom but really what'simportant here to pick out the slantasymptote the thing that's important isyou basically look at the stuff withoutthe fraction so if you look at the Xplus four that's going to be your slantasymptote y equals x plus 4 so againintuitively if you were to graph xsquared plus 1 over X minus 4 this isactually going to have a verticalasymptote at 4 we can talk about thatsomewhere else but if you think aboutthe line y equals x plus 4 that's justgoing to be a straight line so there'smy real rough graph I didn't intend tograph here but the idea is for largevalues of X this function is going toget close to that slant asymptote andlikewise as we go to negative infinitythis function if you were to graph itwould be getting close to that slantasymptote you know to figure out what'sgoing on in the middle graphingeverything else you might find Xintercepts Y intercepts verticalasymptotes and go about that but uhcertainly a little bit more in depth inwhat I want to do in this video so theslant asymptote in this case would justbe the line y equals x plus 4so let's do one other one here realquick let's do the 3 X cubed minus 2xover negative 2 x squared plus 4 I'mgoing to do the exact same thing I'mjust going to do long division basicallywhat we get on top when we do longdivision is what's going to be our ourslant asymptote so let's see we've got 3X cubed same thing notice there's no xsquared term so I'm going to fill it inzero x squared we've got a negative 2 Xon the outside we're dividing bynegative 2 x squaredagain there's zero X's I'm going to fillthat in just makes everything line up alittle bit better is the idea okay sohere the arithmetic is going to be alittle tricky which is why I picked thisone so I know I'm going to need anegative times a negative to get apositive well I think if we take 2 times3 halves so negative 2 times negative 3halves the twos would cancel thenegative would make a positive 3 we needX cubed we're multiplying by x squaredso I think we're going to need an extraX and now I have to multiply negative 3over 2x times everything at thebeginning so this one may take you a youknow an extra second if you want to workit out beforehand I know definitelypeople don't like the fractions but okayanyway so negative 3 halves timesnegative 2 that's going to give uspositive 3x squared and X is going togive us X cubed and that's exactly whatwe need for things to cancel out againwe'll get 0 x squared when we multiplyin the middle and let's see we'll haveto take negative 3 halves times 4 welldefinitely a positive and a negative isgoing to give us a negative 4 times 3 is12 over 2 is 6 and then we'll be leftwith an X we do the same thing wesubtractso the three X cubes are going to cancelwe've got no X Squared's we've gotnegative 2x minus negative 6x which isgoing to be negative 2x plus 6x orpositive 4x and remember once this thingis smaller degreethen what you're dividing by that's whenwe stop our long division okay so whatit says is it says we can write thisfunction 3x cubed minus 2x over negative2 x squared plus 4 it says we can reallywrite that as negative 3 over 2x andwe're going to have the remainder of 4 xover negative 2 x squared plus 4 soagain what that means in this case isour slant asymptote if you look at thepart without the fraction well I guessthat's a H that's that's a bad way ofsaying it because certainly this has afraction you basically the stuff that wehad on top right we were left withnegative 3 over 2x whatever you're leftwith that's going to be your slantasymptote okay so it says our slantasymptote in this case will be simplynegative 3 over 2x so here we've got aslant asymptote with a negative slopeI guess typically we make the asymptotesdotted so let me make it dotted herereal quick so it says this rationalfunction is going to get close to theline y equals negative 3 over 2 X againfor large values of X and again it couldbe approaching from the you know thebottom part or from the top part all Iknow is that it's getting closer to thatas you approach negative infinity andpositive infinity so all right I hopethis helps a little bit definitely inanother video I'm going to talk aboutfinding vertical asymptotes I believe Ialready have a video out there aboutfinding horizontal asymptotes and thenin another video I'm going to put it alltogether and actually talk aboutgraphing rational functions so feel freeto look for those as always if you havequestions or comments feel free to postthem
