what's up everyone and welcome to thislesson on Fahrenheit and Celsius now interms of weather and temperature we knowthat very low temperatures representcold weather and as the temperaturerises to higher numbers the weather getswarmer and warmer now even when theweather is the same the values that weuse to measure temperature are relativeto what systems of measurement that wechoose to use now the letter F standsfor degrees Fahrenheit which is thesystem that we use in the United Statesand a few other places in the world theletter C is going to stand for degreesCelsius which is the system that is usedeverywhere else like seriouslyeverywhere else now fortunately we caneasily convert back and forth betweenthese two different measurement systemsso here's the formula for convertingdegrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheitnow we can solve this equation for Cusing a little bit of algebra if westart out by subtracting 32 from bothsides of the equal sign that will cancelout on the right side over on the leftside F minus 32 we're just going toleave as the expression F - 32 sincethey are not like terms and cannot becombined now over on the right side Iwant to get rid of that fraction that 9over 5 so I multiplied both sides by itsreciprocal 5 over 9 on the right sidethose fractions will cancel out and nowwe have C by itself and we see here nowwe have the formula for convertingdegrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius sonow we're ready to go ahead andfamiliarize ourselves with using theseformulas to convert back and forthbetween degrees Fahrenheit and degreesCelsius so for our first example we wantto go ahead and convert 35 degreesCelsius to degrees Fahrenheit so we wantto use the Fahrenheit formula here so wecan substitute 35 for C and now all youhave to do is evaluate 9 over 5 times 35is equal to 63 and then 63 plus 32equals 95 the number of degrees inFahrenheit so if you're used to theFahrenheit scale if you saw 35 degreesyou might think that that represents avery cold temperaturebut in reality in degrees Farenheit is avery warm temperaturenow for our next example we want toconvert 50 degrees Fahrenheit to degreesCelsius so we're going to use theCelsius formula here start by replacingF with 50 and now just evaluate 50 minus32 in parentheses is equal to 18 andthen 5 over 9 times 18is equal to 10 so again if you're usedto degrees Farenheit if you saw 10degrees you might think that the weatheris going to be pretty cold when actuallyit's really not even that badthank you again everyone for joining usand please reach out to us on twitter atmash up math we are dying to hear fromyou so please share some love all rightwe're done here
