okay what do ya be now again you didn'thave to draw a diagram they gave you oneright but every time you draw it itgives you some insight into what's goingon and how the shape works and howeverything fits together okay our firstquestion is to get a volume okay now youknow everyone knew pretty much ever donethe grade knew I had to multiplysomething right but the question is thisso many numbers herewhat do you multiply by okay so okay nowlet's think about this right there ismultiplication here but let's thinkabout what these numbers are right thisthree it's a high four is this base herethese are all lengths aren't they rightnow you can't add lengths to get avolume because if you add you know thislength Plus this length and another yeahyou get perimeter white-shoe right it'llgo all the way around the shape okayso addition would happen if we had likedifferent parts this volume that weneeded to piece together but in thiscase it's all just the winding piece soI need to look at this and remember thisis um what kind of shape is this youguys let me give you the name today ifthere's a triangle right but it's atriangular something good it's a prismnow do you remember we sort of forms adanger that time when I brought in aprop to help you remember why is hegoing to prison so the prop is a sawright what does that have to do withthis yeah good so the idea is prisonersout taking across nature Sasori acrossnow have a look where does the crosssection belong which way does it do I doI cut this way why not why Cannot I cutthis way so yeah so yeah so for instanceif I cut this way this way this way thisway what am I gonna get I'm gonna get awhole bunch of us I'm gonna get a wholebunch of different sizes I'll get arectangle here see that and they don'tget a smaller rectangle and a smallerrectangle and they'll be they'll getlower and lower and all off okay butthey're all different that's the problemright so it's not a prism that way Ineed to soarin a way that gives me the same shapeevery time like a like a loaf of breadyou remember that okay so which way toMike hmm now I've been cut in half a lotof different ways length ways it's likewell which other ways been lightly Icare all right so I'm gonna draw one infor you okay he's one I can read yourmind it's a bit they go okay so you cansee again the diagram how helpful it isbecause look look he's one cross-sectionthe one on the front okay you got one onthe back and then you got this way alittle bit all the same you see that sothat's what we've got to work out thearea of okay the volume is going to bewhat is the area of that cross-sectionthat triangle that's the area of atriangle say this triangle in the frontbecause remember it's a prism so thisshould all be the same at least at thefingers crossed all right what's thearea of a triangle yep huh times basewhich is the four very good times highwhich in this case is three good sothere you go that's the area of thecross-section okay yeah there you gookay so that's the first bit and thenyou multiply by one more thing to getthe whole volume right since we'recutting it this way you're gonna get aslice here this is the dimension we'recutting along so it'll be by six that'swhat we're on yepI'm not just cutting in huh I'm cuttingit all these different spots it's justI'm not drawing one on that because mydiagram I'm feeling it yeah no that'sright I mean I'm gonna have one here aswell and then another one here I'm gonnahave a whole bunch all the way acrossokay so you can see my triangular slicesof bread okayall right now this number here a half byfour by three that's half by 12 or 12 isC which coincidentally is also 36 it's avolume so one of my units just look atthisvolume is always cute okay because it'salways three dimensions three dimensionsokayall right the surface area we're gonnahave to do some more drawings so this isthat was planning let's have a go shallwe it's worth mentioning by the waythere's lots of different nets you candraw for instance this is not the onlynet of a cube right for instance likesee these bits right you would fold themaround okaybut these sides they don't have to bethere they can be in other spots rightso for instance this this would also beso yeah it would look a bit trickierdefault but you could still do it andthat's why some people have differentnets you might be seen next to someonewho's got one looks different to yoursbut that's okay I'm gonna draw thatmainstream ones okay gonna be a bitantique if sitting all right I thinkmost people start with the base thething on the bottom okay what are itsdimensions I may be sure that's whatshape is it what shape is the base it'sa rectangle good so what are itsdimensions four by six very good four bysix so you're looking down at it rightfour by six celebrateso this is the base I'm looking down thetop okay so then what you can do is takethis part this kind of slanted roof bitI suppose and then yeah you're on yourunhinging if you like so it comes aroundlike this and becomes flat okay so ifI'm looking down this it's gonna be likesirall right again same question what areits dimensions you still get the sameseatyeah very good so you've got this parthere which has now come out onto thefloor okay so you got a five-day whichis why I've drawn it long time okay nowfrom here you can most people havestopped here so let's go back furtherwhat's going to happen what else comesoff the base it's not just this slantedroof what else is coming off the baseyeah okay so I've got this part I'llfold that one down as well and what isits dimensions three and these are allsix yeah good okay I'm going all therectangular bits what's missingokay where should I put them yeah mostmost people have put them in here whichis fine you don't have to but it's agood spot for it so it looks kind oflike this doesn't it yeah yeah happywith that okay now I need somedimensions here to see how if I fall ofthis back up this side is going to matchup to this side isn't it they're boththree and it's all it's all symmetricalokay happy times okay all right now thatyou have all the pieces that wasactually the hard part most people'strouble got the wrong answer becausethey missed a piece right so getting itall out like that that's the easiest wayto make sure you don't miss anythingokay now how look at this right see thismiddle part you built it by putting inthree rectangles right when you putthree rectangles together what's thewhole shape it's written thank you sotherefore I can work out this wholerectangle all at once save a bit of timeright the width here is six this is mysurface area so six times what's thehighfive four three so it's nine let's staywith yourselfgood okay so now I've done that wholerectanglewhat should I add to that what should Iadd okayhow many triangles do I have two of themright and now here's the great thingright you already looked at the triangledidn't she look here he is right that'sthe area of the triangle it's thecross-section yeah so you can just popthat in half times four times threeareas so you got six by 12 which iswho's good with the times those sixtimes seven plus double six we cannot dothat that's 12 which gives you a fourit's a surface area so the units shouldbe squared very good
