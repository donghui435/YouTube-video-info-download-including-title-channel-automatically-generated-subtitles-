consider a triangle PQR with sight25:39 and 56 units how do we go in thearea of this triangle we don't have theheight or the base but we have beengiven the length of all three sidessince we've been given only the lengthof the sides we know we have to use theheron's formula and to use the formulawe need this semi perimeter of thetriangle let's zoom out and find thesemi perimeter which is s the parameterwill be 25 plus 39 plus 56 the sum ofall three sides and the semi-perimeterwill be the parameter divided by 2 thissum equals 120 the semi-perimeter willbe 120 by 2 which equals 60 units wehave found the semi-perimeter but how dowe use the heron's formula how do wefind the area of triangle PQR the areaof triangle PQR will equal square rootof s multiplied by s minus a multipliedby s minus b multiplied by s minus Cwhere a B and C are the three sides ofthe triangle in this case s is 60 a canbe 25 B 39 and C 56 units we just needto be a little careful with thecalculations here as the numbers whenmultiplied get really big the area wouldequal square root of 16 multiplied by 16minus 25 multiplied by 60 minus thirtynine x 60 minus 56 that will equalsquare root of 16 multiplied by 60 minus25 is 35 x 60 minus 39 is 21 x 60 minus56 is 4 think about the product of thesenumbers it will be massive the worstthing you could do here is multiply thisnumberto find the product in our videos basedon square roots we have seen that if thenumber is big we should use the primefactorization method to find the squareroot and to use the prime factorizationmethod we have to reduce all the numbersto their prime factors let's look at thenumber 60 to start off 60 can be writtenas 2 times 2 times 3 times 5 35 can bewritten as 5 x 7 21 can be written as 3x 7 and 4 can be written as 2 times 2the next step in the prime factorizationmethod was to start making groups of twosame numbers there are four twos theycan be written as 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 apartfrom that there are two threes we canwrite it as 3 times 3 2 fiveswritten as 5 times 5 and two 7s as seventimes seven to get the square root ofthese numbers we pick one number fromeach pair multiply them and remove thesquare root sign it will equal 2 x 2 x 3x 5 x 7 that gives us 420 square unitsthe formula is pretty simple it is justthe calculations we need to be carefulabout another important thing you needto remember here is the units of theanswer the units of area are always insquared termsthink about the other formula of thearea of the triangle it's 1/2 base xheight in this formula it's easy tounderstand the units as units of baseand height are multiplied to get squaredunits but how do we get squared unitshere look at the formula carefully 4lengths are multiplied so the unitswould be square root of units raised to4 that gives us unitswell which is the same as squared units
