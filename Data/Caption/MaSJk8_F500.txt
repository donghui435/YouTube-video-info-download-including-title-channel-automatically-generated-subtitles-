hey there everyone welcome back tomashup math my name is Anthony and thankyou for joining me on this mini lessonlet's go ahead and get started hieveryone and thank you again for joiningme on this lesson where we are going toexplore the properties of equivalentratios so in this lunchtime scenario wehave Kevin and Christina for a bothordering lunch to bring back to theirco-workers Kevin orders six hamburgersand two tacos while Christina ordersthree hamburgers and one taco and wewant to explore the ratio of hamburgersto tacos in this situation so with thisratio in mind let's regroup both Kevinand Christina's ordersdoing this allows us to see that forboth Kevin and Christina for every threehamburgers ordered there is one taco soeven though Kevin ordered twice theamount of food that Christina did theratios are still equivalent because forevery three hamburgersthere is one taco in this case a threeto one ratio so now let's move forwardand explore the questions what does itmean when two ratios are equivalent howcan I show that two ratios areequivalent and where can I get one ofthose tacoskidding kidding so now let's get somepractice in determining whether or nottwo ratios are equivalent in this casewe have the ratio of 4 to 5 and theratio of 12 to 15 and we want to see ifthey are equivalent ratios now a ratiocan be written in fraction form with anumerator and a denominator so we'regoing to go ahead and start bytransforming these two ratios intofractionsdoing this allows us to determine if thetwo ratios are equivalent because weknow that two fractions are equivalentif their cross products are equal sowe're going to go ahead and find thosecross products and see if they're equaland if they are then we can say thatthese are equivalent fractions so let'sstart by cross multiplying and we'llstart out with five times 12 which weknow equals 60and then we'll find our second crossproduct by multiplying 4 and 15 and thatproduct is also equal to 60 so noticethat in this case our cross productswere equal and that means that we canmake the determination that these tworatios are equivalent and we can justifythat statement because as we just showedthe cross products are equal oh cool sonow let's go ahead and take a look atone last example in this case we want tosee if the ratio 4 to 7 and the ratio 6to 12 are equivalent just like in thelast example we can start off byconverting the ratios to fractions withthe numerator and the denominator thenwe can go ahead and find the crossproducts and see whether or not they areequal we could start with 4 times 12whose product is 48 and then comparethat to the second cross product 7 times6 whose product is 42 notice here thatin this example the cross products of 48and 42 are not equal therefore we canconclude that these two ratios are notequivalent so now that we have exploredboth the concept and the proceduresinvolved with exploring equivalentratios you can now extend thisunderstanding to future problems thanksagain for stopping by everyone and Iwill see you soon haha cool alright sothat's it for this lesson thank youagain for stopping by I hope you foundit helpful and if you did please clickthat link below and subscribe to our YouTube channel leave a thumbs up and acomment on this video you can really useyour support and also don't forget tosign up for our weekly newsletter whenyou join our mailing list you get a freeebook download as well as weeklyresources tips insights and some coolcontests and giveaways as well so don'tmiss out on that there's a link on thispage you can click to join the mailinglist and that's all you have to do sothank you so much again for stopping byand for all your support and I will seeyou all next time bye
