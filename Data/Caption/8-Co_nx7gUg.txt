call this a for the area of this regionthe area of this sector this section ofthe circle right thereso the formula that relates all of thesevariables here is area equals one-half Rsquared times theta so one half Rsquared theta now the thing you want toremember is that theta has to be inradians so the central angle Espeonradians so if they give it to you indegrees convert it to radians if youneed help with that refer to one of myprevious videos about converting theunits from degrees to radians radians todegrees and want to make sure this is inRadian so let's do an example let's saywe have a circle like this say theradius is 4 inches say this centralangle is M PI over 6 radians and we wantto find the area okay so what we'regoing to do is area equals 1/2 4 squaredthat's the radius squared times thecentral angle which is PI over 6 all wehave to do is simplify now and that'sthe area of the sector so 1/2 times 16times PI over 6you can do some reducing numerator anddenominator let's do that so 2 goes inhere once 2 goes in here 8 2 goes intoboth of these 3 & 4 so if you multiplyacross you get 4 PI over 3 inches
