okay in this video I want to talk aboutfactoring trinomials by trial and errorand in particular I'm going to factor aquadratic expression so a few remarksfirst off even even this uh this problemthat looks you know probably not too badright the numbers aren't too big it eventhis can be very very very tediouslikewise if what we are about to dodoesn't necessarily if it doesn't workthat doesn't mean that this doesn'tnecessarily factor it just means thatit's not going to factor with nicerational numbers is basically what it'sgoing to mean so let's talk about thistedious procedure and unfortunatelythese are extremely common type ofproblems and you're going to just seethem all the timeso life isn't always fairok so what I'm going to do is I'm goingto make 2 sets of parentheses I'm goingto put two terms in each set ofparentheses when I distribute everythingout I want to get the you know this 3xsquared plus X minus 4 I want to getthat back ok when I multiply the firsttwo terms I'm going to try to get the 3xsquared well the only way to get the xsquared would be to have an X and an Xat least if we use you know whole numberexponents likewise to get 3 the onlything I can really use is a 3 and a 1again using whole numbers ok so so farso good now the numbers we put thesecond numbers we put in each set ofparentheses we're going to have tomultiply together to give us ournegative 4 so already to me this iswhere it gets a little tricky becausewe're thinking what numbers multiply tonegative 4 well there's positive 1and there's negative for likewisenegative one and positive four wouldwork also we could use two and negativetwothose would multiply to give me againI'm looking for numbers that multiply tonegative four again whatever theconstant is so already okay well I'vegot three you know three numbers but theproblem isyou know if I put the positive one hereand the negative four in the second setI can multiply that out and check that'snot the same thing as if I put the minusfour in the first spot in the positiveone in the second spot so in a sense youknow you're really going to have to lookat lots of different sets of numbers andyou're going to have to sort of look atthem one way and then flip them and lookat them the other way so this is whereI'm saying where it gets really tediousbecause to me if this factors nicelythey'll either be a positive 1 and anegative 4 or there'll be a negative 4here and a positive 1 here from thesecond set it says maybe there's anegative 1 here and a positive 4 herelikewise maybe those flip and we have apositive 4 first and a negative 1 secondwell 2 and negative 2you'd have positive 2 negative 2 or youcould flip that and have negative 2 andpositive 2 so already there's sort ofsix possibilities of what I'm going tohave to check and the fun part isthere's no guarantee that any of thesewill even work and there's no guaranteethat just because they don't workdoesn't mean it doesn't factor so almostseems unfairso what I'm going to do is I'm justgoing to start checking so I'm going tolook at the first the first numbers Ihave 3x I'll use positive 1 in the firstset of parentheses and I'll use so againI'm just filling in I'm basically justfilling this in with these numbers sopositive 1 and then I'm going to use Xminus 4 and I'm going to multiply thisout and think does this give me 3xsquared plus X minus 4well 3x times X will be 3x squaredI'll get 3x times negative 4 that'snegative 12x I'll get a positive 1 X onthe inside and then a negative 4well if you combine your like terms Ithink we'll get a 3x squared minus 11xbut we want just positive 1x so whatdoes that tell me it tells me wellthat's not the correct factorization soI know this particular combination doesnot work then I go to the next one okayso we have 3x and X and well maybe I'lltry minus 4 and plus 1 so if Idistribute these out I'll get a 3xsquared I'll get a positive 3xon the inside I'll get a negative 4x andthen it looks like I get a negative 4 ifyou combine the middle terms sorry theygot cut off a little bit if you combinethe middle terms 3x minus 4x is negativex but we want a positive x so close butno cigar so again that means that thatone doesn't work ok so that particularcombination does not work let's trylet's try the let's carry this one justbecause I know it's going to work sothis video won't drag out forever solet's try 3 X and maybe we jump we putthe positive 4 in the first set ofparentheses and the X minus 1 in thesecond set of parentheses if I multiplythat outI'll get 3x times X which is 3x squaredI'll get 3x times negative 1 which isnegative 3x on the inside I get apositive 4x and then we get our negative4 and hey if you simplify this down weget 3x squared negative 3x plus 4x ispositive 1 X minus 4 so that means wehave now found the correct factorizationit's 3 X plus 4and positive 1x minus 1 so again I kindof you know jump the gun a little bityou know you could have checked this andfound it didn't work you know hopefullyyou didn't check 2 negative 2 andnegative 2 2 until you finally got tothat one so you can see that alreadyit's very tedious the worst part isgoing to be if the number in front ofthe x squared has lots of factorsbecause then you have to look at all thedifferent combinations of that one aswellso this is definitely something that'sbeen giving I think algebra studentsnightmares and and headaches for a longtime it takes a lot of practice I'm youknow even still sometimes I see one ofthese and it takes me you know a littlebit of time to play with it and get itcorrect and you know at this point I'mrelatively comfortable and relativelyquick with my arithmetic and I stillfind them tedious so don't getdiscouraged just practice practicepractice I think that's really all thatyou can do for these types of problemsso all right I hope the explanationmakes sense again you're just looking atfactors of the constant factors of theleading coefficient and then you're justplaying with all those combinationsuntil hopefully you stumble upon theright one
