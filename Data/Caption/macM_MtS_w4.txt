Today we are going to be talking about a problem in logicand how in solving that problem,Alan Turing almost inadvertently
invented the modern digital computer.So we start back at the beginning of the
20th century, where mathematicians hadposed this problem - in logic we're
interested in finding "Do these premisesentail this conclusion?" So premises are
the bits you start off with in an argumentthey are your -- the bits you know at the
beginning or your assumptions and theconclusion is the bit you want to
establish the bit that you reason towith your argument and we want to know
is there a test that will tell usyes for sure these premises do or don'tentail this conclusion. Is there an
automatic way of finding out whetherthey do or whether they don't?So that's the problem, it's called the
decision problem.The mathematicians wanted to find out "Is
there an answer to the decision problemfor first order logic?"that's the kind of logic you learn in
philosophy or mathematics at universityso lots of mathematicians were trying to
work out is first order logic decidablethat is can we automatically test
whether the premises entail theconclusionAlan Turing was one of the first to
discover that first order logic isn'tdecidable. To prove thisit's really difficult conceptually
because you have to be able to show nopossible program can give you the answer
but how do you do that how do you showsomething about every possible programyou can't run through every program one
by onebut Turing came up with a brilliant
solutionhis idea goes something like thissuppose we have a program and let's just
draw it as a black boxit's going to take some inputs and it's
going to give us some outputsour program is going to solve some
problem a problem like "Do the premisesentail the conclusion" we ask it a
question and it will give us an answeryes or nonow here's another question we can ask
let's look at all of those possibleprograms and we're just thinking of them
as black boxes at the moment we mightwant to know is this program given a
certain input going to give us an answeror is it going to trundle on forever and
never give us an answer that is is itgoing to halt or is it not going to halteventually so think about your computer
running you want it to give you ananswer of whether it's a good answer or
a bad answerit's better than no answer. No answer
would mean the computer trundles aroundforever and ever in a loop and you would
just never know whether it's going tofinish today tomorrow or neverso halting is good so there's another
question we can ask given some programand some inputwill it ever halt? Now it turns out that
our logical problem"Do these premises entail this conclusion?"
is very similar to this halting problemin fact if we can solve the logical
problem then we can solve the haltingproblemwill this program halt on this input so
the clever part of Turing's proof isto show that it's impossible for any
machine however clever it is to solvethe halting problem that is to tell us
whether a given machine with a giveninput will halt or not - and here's how
he did itlet's suppose we've got a machine or a
program that solves the problem for usit solves the halting problem don't
worry about how it works let's justthink of it as a black box taking the
description of a machine and an inputand giving us an answeryes it will halt or no it won't halt
just suppose that's possiblecall that machine "h" for the halting
problem - if you give me that machineI can transform it into a different
machine like thisI stick some extra bits on it so that if
it gives me a yes answerI make it loop forever without ever
stoppingif it gives me a no answer on the other
handand it's going to halt straight away
let's call that big machinethe whole thing "h+" now here's another
question we can ask what happens if Ifeed the whole machine into itself so
i'm going to put h+ in here and h+in hereso the question I'm now asking is I'm
feeding h+ into itself so i'm asking thequestion "Does h+ halt given input h+?"
and here's where it all goes wrongbecause if h plus does haltwe get a yes answer but then it loops
foreverso it doesn't halt on the other hand if
it doesn't haltwe get a no answer but then it halts so
if it does halt then it doesn't haltbut if it doesn't halt then it does
halt. Either way we get a contradictionit's a paradox but what that shows is we
started off assuming that we can solvethe problemwe've ended up with a paradox so our
assumption was badit turns out there's no possible machineno possible program that solves the
halting problemthe really clever bit about Turing's
idea is it doesn't matter what kind ofprogram our machine is. It doesn't matter
whether it's an abstract algorithmwhether it's a real computer, a physical
computerit doesn't matter what it is we've prove
that no such program as possibleTuring as part of his argument had to
say a little bit about what's going onin these black boxes //DFB: and the idea is
that every card represents an instructionin the Turing machine
