okay this video I'll show you how tofind the horizontal and also thevertical slopes of this function firstfor the horizontal acid hope remember wehave to take two limits the first one isthe limit as X approaches positiveinfinity of this function and if we doget a finite valued right here then yequals 2 that a finite value will be thehorizontal slope and we also have towork out the limit as X approachesnegative infinity of the functionbecause this value might be differentthan that if this is also finite then wewill have another horizontal slope sofor example just like the inversetangent X it has two differenthorizontal as tops but of course thesetwo files could be the same so in thatcase you still have one and if the limitdon't exist what limit is like infinityor negative infinity then we don't havehorizontal Stokes so we're just going towork this out first and let's get goingfirst we take the limit as X approachespositive infinity of this function 3xminus 6 over x squared plus X minus 6and notice this one here is really nicebecause we have a polynomial overanother polynomial so to take the limitas 8 approaching infinity X approachinginfinity you can just compare thehighest power of X on the top and thehighest power of X on the bottom and yousee that this is the same as a the limitas X approaches passed team Finity onthe top is just 3x on the bottom it'sjust x squared remember we can do thisif X is approaching infinity or negativeinfinity right and the purpose of thisis that we are just trying to comparethe ratio of the top and the bottom thedominating part of the top over thedominating part of the bottom and yousee that in this case Xx-square they can cancel so we have onlyone of it and this is saying the limitas X approaches infinity we get 3 over Xand plugging infinities who here we get3 over infinity and notice that this isjust a none infinity it's just a finitenumber over infinity we get to aconclusion right here which is 0 and inthis case we see that this is finite sowe have y equals to 0 as one of thehorizontal obstacles if this isdifferent that we have to if this is thesame was to have won by anyway that'spretty much it for that part and now forthis part we do the same thing the limitas X approaches negative infinity of thesame function of course and we can stilldo the same thing right when X isapproaching negative infinity on the topwe can just care about the 3 X on thebottom we can just care about the xsquared once again we are just trying tocompare the dominating part of the topand also the bottom and this is thelimit as X approaches negative infinityof 3x over X square and I know some ofyou guys noticed this is pretty much thesame as that and you cancel things outyou get the limit as X approachesnegative infinity of 3 over X and youcan plug in negative infinity here andyou get 3 over negative infinity righthere even though you have positive 3over negative infinity this is still 0if you want to put on negative 0 that'sstill 0 so this is 0 and notice we havey equals to 0 so if they are the samethat means we only have one horizontalacetal and that is y equals to 0 andthis right here is it right and nowlet's talk about how we can find thevertical asymptotesand in this situation when we have arational function like this what we wantto worry about uswe have to have a noun serious situationon the top over zero like thatwell sometimes you may end up with zeroover zero in that case it might be anopen circle on the graph namely aremovable discontinuity but when youhave a non zero over zero situation mostlikely the function will have a verticalstop there so with this set we are justgoing to worry about the bottom for nowso we can find a candidate of theparticular slope that means I will justhave to set x squared plus X minus 6 Iwill have to set this to be zero and Ican solve this by factoring we get Xplus 3 times X minus 2 from the firstpart we see X plus 3 has to be 0 thatmeans X has to be negative 3 for thesecond part we see that X minus 2 has tobe 0 that means X has to be 2 and fromthis point on you have to be extracarefulyes these two numbers are going to makethe denominator 0 so you have to get ridof these numbers from the domain but ifyou're talking about the vertical a sortof situation pay attention to this wealso have to make sure that the topcannot be 0 so what do I mean by thatlet me demonstratewe will have to plug in negative 3 intothe original right into the original andsee if we have a non zero over zerosituation or not let's check that outplugging negative 2 into here we get 3times negative 3 and then minus 6 overover what over zero because we know ifyou plug in negative 3 into the patternit will be zero things with just thetaright and now you see on the top 3 timesnegative 3 is negative 9 minus 6 isnegative 15 over this dorota alreadyhalf so you know if it's this conditionso yes there will be a vertical assethope at negative 3 so I'll just put thisdown the a right here right so checks onthe other hand though if you plug in 2into the original function we see thatthat's going to be 3 times 2 minus 6over what over the 0 why because youknow it already because you just thoughtthat but on the top you seeing this time3 times 2 is 6 minus 6 is 0 over thisrule that we already have in thissituation you actually don't have avertical asset or you can do a littlebit more investigation and investigationis you take the limit as X approaches 2of the function and you see that you get3x minus 6 over that x squared plus Xminus 6 and to do this limit you knowthat if you plug in 2 into all the X youand os3 over 0 so you simplify theexpression you see that on the top is 3times X minus 2 on the bottom you factorit you get that X plus 3 times X minus 2and of course you see X minus 2 can becancelled it and then from here you getthe limit as X approaches 2 of 3 over Xplus 3 and plug in 2 now you get 3 over2 plus 3 namely you get 3 over 5 thisright here tells you when X isapproaching to the Y value isapproaching 3 over 5 and when X isexactly to the functions actuallyundefined that means you will have anopen circle when X is 2 then this righthere it's actually the removablediscontinuity right so you'll see theopen circle you have a nice graph butthere's an open circle there's no jumpbecauselimit you to have a left rudder mappingequal to 3 over 5 so this right hereit's a removable there's continuityright this continuity like thatit's movable it's not jump even thoughyou have an open circle but anyway thisit's not a vertical as though so be sureit's just to all this kind of check andIndian will just write this down for youguys right here for the 30 call us athope we only have that and you write itdown the formula x equals 2y but this isso this X is equal to negative 3this is this is it and in addition ifthe question is asking you for removablediscontinuity this is what you do so Ican tell you every movable and she'sready down removable removable thiscontinuity right is add x equals to 2 soyeah that's what you have to answer ifthe questions also asking you for thatby anyway this is it
