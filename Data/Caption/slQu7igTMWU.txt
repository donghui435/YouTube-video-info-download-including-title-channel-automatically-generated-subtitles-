okay today we're going to be taking alook at the quadratic formula all rightthis is another way to solve a quadraticequation whenever factoring doesn't workor completing the square doesn't work orsome other method does not workquadratic formula will be able to helpyou solve the equation alright let'sreview a quadratic equation is a xsquared plus bx plus c equals 0 and thea and the B are the coefficients C is aconstant there those will be the numbersthat we will be using and plug it intoour formula the quadratic formula aformula that you need to memorize isnegative b plus or minus the square rootof b squared minus 4ac all over 2a withthe a and the B and the C being thenumbers from the equation that you aretrying to solve okay so for my firstexample here I've got 2x squared plus 4xminus 7 equals 0 and we are trying tosolve this equation all right firstthing I'm going to do is I'm going to gothrough and I'm going to identify myvariables all right so a is to B is forand C will be a negative 7 because itwas a minus 7 on the end of the equationall right so I'm going to directly go tothis formula and i'm going to plug inthe values i need now to start with itsnegative b b is for so then i will havea negative 4 and then plus or minuswhich is that little sign right there inthe middle and then I'm going to have Bsquared B is 4 so 4 squared minus 4times a times C I a is too and my c isnegative 7 and there was a square rootover all of that and then that's allover 2 times whatever a is an a is tooall right from here on out the rest ofthe way it's just a matter ofsimplifying things out negative 4 isgoing to stay right there in front forright now I'm going to leave the plus orminus underneath that radical 4 squaredis 16 all right minus now i'm going tomultiply 4 times 2 times a negative 7that's going to give me a negative 56when i multiply that outthat's all underneath the radical andthen my denominator is going to be afour E alright simplifying underneaththat radical depending on how you handleyour negatives and integers here Iusually do that as a plus plus so then ican simplify that down to a negative 4plus or minus the square root of 72 allover for all right now right here iswhere you need to recognize and dosomething with this plus or minus okayat this point right here that expressioni gives two answers all right it givestwo answers because of the plus or minussign all right so it gives us twoanswers because of that plus or minussign right there so what I'm going to dois I'm going to break this expression upinto my two different answers okay sofirst of all for my first one I'll havea negative 4 and I'm going to choose todo the plus square root of 72 and thenall over for that's going to be my firstanswer or my second answer would be thenegative 4 and then I'm going to chooseto do the minus sine square root of 72all over for all right now square rootof 72 it's going to turn out to be adecimal we cannot do those in our headso at this point you're probably gonnaneed to put this entire thing into acalculator and come up with the decimaldirections pay attention to thedirections and around to whatever itsays to round two just to check to makesure you're doing that right dependingon how good your calculator is howcomplicated is you might need to put aset of parentheses around that numeratorso that the calculator knows that to docalculate that entire value before itdivides by four same thing on this oneall right just depending on yourcalculator you might need to put someset parentheses in there okay let's goahead and work these out x if put into acalculator and done correctly X is goingto be approximately 1 point 1 2 1 3 2 03 4 4 and it's going to you know go onforever and ever and ever and on thisone x is approximately equal to negative312 13 20 344 you're going to get greatbig long decimals like that and thenprobably your book might say around sothere's 10th round to the nearesthundredth on this one if I was roundingto the nearest hundredth I would have xis approximately equal to 1 point 1 2 orx is approximately equal to pointnegative 3.12 again so again we're goingto have two answers to each of thesegenerally most of the time all rightlet's take a look at a second examplethat's maybe not as straightforward asthat first one was ok this one we've gotan x squared plus 6 equals a negative 5all right so not exactly matching ourquadratic formula here quadraticequation alright so I'm going to need tomove all my terms to the left and when Ichoose to do that I want my x squaredterm first and then the X term secondand my constant last so when i subtract5x from both sides of the equation tomove it over i'm going to choose to putit in the middle okay so i'm going tosubtract 5x from both sides x squaredminus 5x and then the plus 6 equals 0 okI might as well do that right away inthe first step because I know I wantthem in this order so that I canidentify my variables there's going tobe the imaginary one there which is my aB is going to be a negative 5 and then Cwill be 6 ok and then again it's just amatter of plugging everything into thequadratic formula making sure you don'tmake any mistakes and working it outalright so in this one B is a negative 5already and the formula says I have todo negative B so the negative that's inthe formula is going to go first andthen I'm going to replace be with whatit is so really I've got a negativenegative 5 over here on the outside plusor minus B squared so that would be anegative 5 squared minus 4 times a dayis 1 times c cs6 all of that isunderneath the radicaland then I'm going to multiply that bytwo times a and in this case a is onealright simplifying some more a negativetimes a negative is positive so I'llhave a five right here plus or minus anegative 5 squared will give me apositive 25 minus 4 times 1 times 6 willbe 24 and all of that is under theradical and two times one on the bottomthat is going to be a to simplifyingjust a little bit more 25-24 is going togive me a one under there so 5 plus orminus the square root of 1 all over 2all right and then square root of 1 is 1ok so let's go one more step 5 plus orminus 1 all over 2 all right at thispoint now this is where it gives us twoanswers gives two answers all right soat this point you can use the plus orminus sign that's in the middle andbreak it up so that you get your twoanswers we would have a 5 plus 1/2 andwe can even say x equals or x equals 5minus 1 all over 2 x plus 1 is 6 dividedby 2 that's going to give me an x equals3 and 5 minus one that's going to giveme a 4 4 divided by 2 so he made two onthat one x equals 2 alright so on thisone because we got a square root that weknew we could do square root of one morehead we didn't even need to usecalculator at all ok the only time youneed to go to the calculator and roundout a couple decimal places is when thatsquare root turns out to be a numberthat you cannot do in your head alrightbut pretty much all of your quadraticequations are going to be worked outlike this at least be in a beginningalgebra one class if your originalequation is not in that ax squared plusBX plus C form you want to make sure yourearrange terms move everything over tothe left so that you've got yourequation set equal to zero and then youcan solve it using the quadratic formula
