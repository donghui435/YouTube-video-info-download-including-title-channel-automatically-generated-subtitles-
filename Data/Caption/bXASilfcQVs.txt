we're looking at this question I need toknow in the corner it does tell us itgives us a hint what the slant height iscan somebody described to me where thatis on this particular diagram wherewould the slant height be what do youthink Austin awesome so the word slantkind of gives it away right it's gotit's got to be kind of like on thatangle so really if I pick this one hereis that the only option I have is thatthe only option what do you think whatdo you think they're Hassan awesome so Icould look this way as well the way thediagrams of created it kind of lookslike they're trying to get you to usethe right one however not necessary butlet's assume we use this guy here andnow let's actually label this trianglehere first off what kind of triangle isthis and how would I know what do youthink Sofia right angle triangle whattells you that does it necessarilythough like does it tell me does itguarantee by the diagram that it does orare you making that I don't want to sayassumption but do you know it for someother reason what do you think becausenormally we have a symbol when there's aright angle what's that symbol look likewhat do you think yeah a little box soI'm assuming most of us think that's aright angle and I would tend to agreewith you but what's your explanation whywe can make that assumption what do youthink awesome I like that so basicallyit should be a flat base we would assumefor a cone and the height should gostraight from the middle all the way upto the peak or to the vertex okay sothat is going to be a right angletriangle now let's do this thing twoways first off let's label our trianglewhere does our 8 centimeter radius gowhere is that going to go let's getsomebody new need a new here Nina whoknew head yes Hannah awesome so shortline at the bottom let's get that onthere so we've got eight centimeters andhow about the slant height where's theslant height Lukeawesome slanted line now quick questionthat you should be asking yourself whichone or which side is the hypotenuse inthis case which side megan awesome the20 centimeters so nope a couple peopleask me while you're working on it aquick way to identify that verte are notthe vertex sorry but the hypotenuse isto go directly across from the rightangle okay so we know that's thehypotenuse now if we use the same logicas yesterday where we use the area ofsquares to try to calculate the answerhere what am I going to do what wouldthat look like what do you think Sophiawasn't even here but what do you thinkawesome so she's got a formula so she'sgot the C squared equals a skoo i likeit you actually did it you said csquared minus a squared equals B squaredwhy are you doing that with the formulanice nice so you're saying the eightcentimeters is going to be the a squarednow could I also write this like socould I write it like this guy's Csquared minus B squared equals a squaredwould that work is that cool thank youvery much so Anthony says it certainlywould how about this one though what ifI did this how about C squared equals asquared plus B squared because that'sthe actual Pythagorean theorem wouldthat work what do you think what do youthink Hassan awesome so we have Csquared now mind you we could startthere and then we could rearrange theformula right so we've already done thatin the previous two so let's ignore thisguy for now now my question originallythough was how can I use these squaresso remember from yesterday we said thatif we square this side it gives me thatarea if i square this side it gives methis area and if i square this side itgives me the area of that square solet's quickly go through this and makesure that everybody especially those whoweren't here understand what we'retrying to do so let's look at the bottomwhen i square eight centimeters what'sthe area of that box or that squarewhat's that going to be Adam so that's64 centimeters squared okay so there'sthe logic right there we know that eightcentimeters when we sub that in 4b orfor a depending on what you name it thatguy is going to be 64 so thatinformation is given to us here howabout the hypotenuse the box off thehypotenuse what are we looking at therehow about Cameron nice so we have 400centimeters squared probably a poorcolor to use because it looks like it'spart of that equation now however nowthat I know those two numbers what do Ineed to do to find my missing area overhere what would I do Anthonyawesome so he's doing four hundred minus64 why does that make sense why are wenot adding and notice it's matching theformula that Sofia gave us as well as Ithink the second one was given to us byI believe someone at the back tablethere what are you thinking why do wehave to subtract go ahead there but loveit awesome how about visually what wouldbe one reason why what do you thinkthere Anthony awesome i like that logicis well okay so if we do it this waywhat do we get is the area of this boxright here what do we get as that areaof that box yes 3 36 centimeters squarednow if we sub all this information inand we sub it into that formula so thesame idea we could show that it's 400centimeters squared minus 64 centimeterssquared equals that 336 and what do wehave to do to actually find what C isand actually what I'm going to do iswell I'm actually going to back this upa little bit and I'm going to show it ona separate line because remember this isequal to B squared and we got 3 36equals B squared so what do I need to doto both sides to get the value of B whatdo you think is up square root itawesome do I just square root one sidewhat do you think awesome so whatever wedo to one side we do to the other we geta B and what's be equal to folks what isthe what is the side length there Adam18.3 are we all good with that folkswill say centimeters notice when yousquare root centimeters squared you alsonow have centimeters as your unit rightso everything all comes out in the washwhich is kind of nice now if I thinkabout this logically 20 Squared's 400right so something slightly lower willbe 336 18.3 seems real reasonable rightso that's something we should always doand double-check all right are we goodall right perfect
