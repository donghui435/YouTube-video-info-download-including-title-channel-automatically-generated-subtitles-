so in this short video I'm going to showyou and the Ross used calculate speeddistance and time so it helps to knowthis triangle D at the top so distanceequals speed times time distance equalsspeed times time so if for example I wasdoing 20 miles per hour on my bike forthree hoursif I multiply those two numbers togetherI would have traveled 60 miles now if wewant to work out speed speed will equalthe distance divided by the time so if Irode a hundred miles in 4 hours my speedwould have averaged out I do 100 dividedby 4but I'm then saying as I've gone at 25miles every power which we write as mphmiles per hour so we can find speed bydoing distance divided by time and thenfinally if we want to find time timeequals the distance divided by the speedso if for example I travel 120 miles ina car and I was traveling at 60 milesper hourthen this will take me if I do thedivision 120 divided by 60 it will takeme two hours and think about it if I'vetold 120 miles I'm going 60 miles perhour for two hours that would have givenme the 120 so the I've kept all theunits fairly simple in this question itcan be a bit harder if the numbersaren't the C's are the ones I've givenyou and then we would use a calculatorso I'll give you an example of thatthereso suppose um I was told that I hadtraveled 340 miles in six five hours and15 minuteswhat is my speedso remember that speed equals distancedivided by time and the distance is noproblem that's 340 but the time is aproblem because we've got it indifferent units so we need to change 5hours 15 minutes in 2 hours onlynow that's 5 and 15 out of 60 okaybecause it's 60 minutes per hour now 15over 60 if you use your calculatoryou'll see that's point two five so toanswer this question then I got to do340 divided by 0.25 and you should knowthat 15 minutes is quarter an hour and aquarter as a decimal is point two fiveso we get the calculator now to finishthis offso we're doing 340 divided by 3 400divided by 0.25 and so is 64 point sevensix so we'll change that tone into onedecimal place sixty-four point eight andthe speed would be in miles per hour andI think you just see me squeezing thatin at the bottom of the page so there'ssome examples of speed distance and time
