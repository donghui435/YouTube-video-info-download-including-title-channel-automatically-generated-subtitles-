How to prove Pythagoras' Theoremin under one minute.So Pythagoras' Theorem is the famous theoremthat you all learnt in schoolwhich states that for any right-angle trianglethe square of the hypotenuseis equal to the sum of the squareson the other two sides.Or to put it another way,if I label these sides of this triangle a, b and c,then a squared plus b squared equals c squared. [a^2+b^2=c^2]Now, if I want to prove this, all I have to dois to make four copies of the triangle,and arrange them inside this green square.And if I do that, I will create a squarein the center which has sides of length c.And so, this shaded squarein the center will have an areaof c squared. [c^2]Now, I'm going to rearrange the triangles,like this, and I will createtwo more shaded squareswhich will have areasof a squared up here, [a^2]and b squared here. [b^2]Now, since these all fit inside the same green square,I've shown that the shaded regionshave the same area.In other words, a squared plus b squared equals c squared. [a^2+b^2=c^2]
