JAMES CLEWETT: Absolutely
it's heavy.It is an antique 1980s
television.This is back from when
television was furniture.I love it.Well, this is my
first computer.This is a computer that my
parents had the foresight tobuy me when I was
11 years old.It gave me a curiosity about
mathematics and physics, whichhas never really gone away.Today I'm going to talk
about the number 15.And I want to tell you that if
you're a computer geek likeme, we don't really think
of the number 15 as 15.We think of it as the
letter F, and I'mgoing to tell you why.Right, you've got to
get this sound.This just makes such a fantastic
switch-on sound.[BEEP]Isn't that satisfying?So all I'm going to do is write
a short piece of codethat makes the computer count.I'm rather pleased with myself
that I can still remember howto do this.Tah-dah!So all I'm doing is just
counting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,8, 9, and then something
rather odd happens.And instead of counting to 10,
the computer switches to A, B,C, D, E, F, and then 10.11, 12, 13.And again it happens at 19.1A, 1B, C, D, E, F. 20.How bizarre.I was baffled.I was 11 years old, and we used
to have to wait for gamesto load from cassettes.And when they loaded, they would
count, and that wouldtake maybe 10 minutes.And so I would be watching
these numbers count, verypatiently waiting to play
Pac-Man or Tetris or whatevergame I was playing that day, and
wondering precisely why itwasn't just getting on with
it and getting to 10.You know, why did it have to
go through-- it felt liketorture, because I wanted
to play the game.Get on with it.Count to 10.But no, we had to go A through
F, first of all.So what we need to remember is
that computers don't count theway you and I count
on our fingers.They count on lines representing
ones and zeroes,binary numbers.So what I want to show you is
just four lines, first of all,and the number 0, the number 1,
the number 2, the number 3.And then I'm going
to skip a few.Down here we're going to
go to the number 14.And the number 15.OK, so there's quite a few
numbers in between, which weskipped over for brevity.So this is 0, 1, 2, 3, 14, 15.And I have to stop there.I have to stop there because
we've run out of numbers.If I try and count to a higher
number, that means that's gotto be 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.But I don't have space
for this one here.And so we can't count
to a number biggerthan 15 on four bits.The thing is, if you want to
understand the underlying onesand zeroes that's going on in a
computer, then I need to beable to very quickly say
what is this number?And this number, unfortunately,
bears verylittle relationship to
the decimal value.So, for example, the number
9, this is thenumber 9 for a computer.So the number 11, that's
number 11, OK?Or the number 6, for example,
would be 0, 1, 1, 0, number 6.So what we do instead is we
count in a thing calledhexadecimal.This is base 16.So if we had 16 fingers, then
we would have come up withnumbers sufficient to
go from 1 to 16.But because we only have 10
fingers, we only have 10digits for counting.And so instead of using just
more digits, we used lettersto replace the missing digits.So let's start at the
number 8, and we'llwork our way through.So the number 8 is going
to be 1, 0, 0, 0.That's 8.The number 9, 1, 0, 0, 1.That's 9.And then the number
10, that's 10.Now, notice that in decimal,
we've had to go into a newcolumn for the number 10.But if we're working in
hexadecimal, then this is 8,9, and then this becomes
the letter a.And then 11, that's 11,
and it's the letter b.Then we're just going to skip to
the end, and it's going tobe 1, 1, 1, 1, which is the
number 15, or in our case, theletter f, our magic number.OK, this is magic because it
allows us as programmers tovery quickly see what's going
on with the binary numbers,the electronics inside
the computer.So in an 8-bit computer, we've
got two sets of 4-bit sets.So the number 0 becomes 0,
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.Two lots of four bits.Now, this set can be represented
by one hexadecimaldigit, the letter 0.And just to let you know that
it's hexadecimal, I'm justgoing to write an X
in front of it.And this lot can similarly
be represented by thehexadecimal number 0.So this is 10, and this is 10.But in hexadecimal, we can
still represent this by asingle character.This becomes a, and
this becomes a.In hexadecimal, our number is a,
a, with a little x in frontof it, just to tell you that
it's a hexadecimal number.So I'm going to skip to the crux
of the issue, and that isthe top number that we can
store in an 8-bit value,which, of course, is simply
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.MALE SPEAKER: What
number is that?JAMES CLEWETT: And
that number is--this is f.This is f.So we've got the hexadecimal
number ff, which is equal to255, which is the highest
value that an 8-bitcomputer can store.OK, now, course, modern
computers aren'tsimply eight bits long.Recently, 32 bits, or you can
go out and you can buy atop-end 64-bit computer.So I want to show you the
highest number in veryshorthand notation that a 32-bit
computer can store.Here we go.ff, ff, ff, ff, so 8 bits, 16
bits, 24 bits, 32 bits.Now I'll write that in binary.How I hate you.1111, 1111, 1111, 1111, 1111--I'm going to have to put
a few on the front.And that is the binary number 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,1, 1, 1, 1.You get the idea.It's a big number.And that's why we don't
use binary.We use hexadecimal values.Obviously, if I wanted to write
a really big numberdown, it's just too much
pen and ink, so wedon't use the binary.We don't use decimal because,
well, this number, it's not65,000, it's approximately
4 billion.This has no relationship
to 4 billion.There's no obvious way to tie
the two things together.But when we're using the
hexadecimal numbers, eachcharacter is simply tied to a
block of four binary values.So this character represents the
first four, this characterthe next four.And so it's very easy to just
walk along, understanding thenumber in human readable
chunks.
