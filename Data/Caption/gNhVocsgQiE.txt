hey everybody welcome to my second videoon exponents and in my first video Igave you a brief introduction toexponents and I went over some basicexamples and in this video i want to goover negative exponents and alsoexponents on top of fractions so in myprevious video I went over basicexamples like 3 squared and that 2exponent just means that we multiply 3by itself 2 times 3 times 3 is equal to9 so 3 squared is equal to 9 but whathappens if we have a 3 with a negative 2exponent well if you've never seen anegative exponent I think the naturallogic would be if if 3 with a positive 2exponent is is positive 9 then 3 with anegative 2 exponent would be negative 9and if you use that logic then you aregoing to be completely wrong 100% of thetimeso how do we solve negative exponentswell the first thing I'm going to dobefore I solve the negative exponent isx 1 multiplying by 1 does not change athing a 3 with a negative 2 exponent isexactly the same as 1 times 3 with anegative 2 exponent and you don't haveto multiply by 1 but I like to do itwhen I'm teaching because it makes iteasier to see what's happening later onin this problem so now the question ishow do we solve these negative exponentsand what I like to do is make thenegative exponent positive and there'sonly one thing you have to remember anegative exponent in the numerator is apositive exponent in the denominator sothis 3 with a negative 2 exponent whichis in the numerator right now can bere-written as a 3 with a positiveexponent in the denominator andeverything else stays the same the onewhich is in the numerator stays in thenumerator so now we don't have anymorenegative exponents we have 1 overthree squared which is one over three xitself two times which is equal to 1over 3 times 3 which is 9 1 over 9 soour three with a negative 2 exponent isequal to 1 over 9 all right let's goover another example let's say we have anegative exponent in the denominatorlet's say we have 1 over 3 with anegative 2 exponent and we're going touse the same idea as we did before wewant to take this negative exponent andmake it positive and we're going to usethe same rule as we did before exceptthis way this time we're going to use itthe opposite way a negative exponent inthe denominator is a positive exponentin the numerator so this 3 with anegative 2 exponent in the denominatoris a 3 with a positive 2 exponent in thenumerator and we can't forget about thisone which is also in the numerator aswell but multiplying by 1 is is kind ofredundant it doesn't change the problemso this can just be simplified to 3squared 3 squared is equal to 3 times 33 times 3 is equal to 9 so 1 over 3 tothe negative 2 exponent is equal topositive 9 all right let's go overanother example this time with somenegative numbers and before I do thatI'm going to erase everything so let'ssay we had 6 multiplied by negative 3with a negative 2 exponent and remembera negative exponent in the numerator isa positive exponent in the denominatorso this negative 3 with a negative 2exponent in the numerator can be writtenas a negative 3 with a positive 2exponent in the denominator andeverything else stays the same the 6which is in the numerator stays in thenumerator so now this fraction can besimplified even furthernegative 3 with a 2 exponent is justnegative 3 multiplied by itself twotimes and in our numerator we have a 6 anegative 3 times a negative 3 is goingto give us a positive 9 and in ournumerator we have a 6 and 6 over 9 canbe reduced to 2 over 3 so 6 multipliedby negative 3 with a negative 2 exponentcan't be simplified and our answer is2/3 all right let's go over one moreexample this time with a fraction and Ithink after this you should have areally good idea about negativeexponents so so let's say we have 3 over4 with a negative 2 exponent and onceagain I'm going to multiply by 1/3 over4 with a negative 2 exponent is exactlythe same as 1 times 3 over 4 with anegative 2 exponent so now let's get ridof this negative exponent a negativeexponent in the numerator is a positiveexponent in the denominator so right nowthis is 3 over 4 with a negative 2exponent is in the numerator so we couldrewrite this as a a 3 over 4 with apositive 2 exponent in the denominatorand everything else stays the same theone which is in the numerator stays inthe numerator so now in the denominatorwe have 3 over 4 squared so that is just3 over 4 multiplied by itself 2 times 3over 4 times 3 over 4 and everythingelse stays the same we still have our 1in the numerator and if we simplify ourdenominator we have 3 times 3 which isequal to 9 and we have 4 times 4 whichis equal to 16 and in our numerator westill have our 1 so now we're dividingone by a fractionwhenever you're dividing by a fractionthat issame as multiplying by the reciprocal so1/9 over 16 is the same as 1 multipliedby 16 over 9 dividing by a fraction isthe same as multiplying by thereciprocal and this could be simplifiedeven further 16 over 9 times 1 is just16 over 9 so this is our final answerand I hope this gave you a better ideaon negative exponents in fractions in mynext video I'm going to talk about theproperties of exponents exponentproperties so stay tuned for thatI really hope you're enjoying these andI will see you in my next one
