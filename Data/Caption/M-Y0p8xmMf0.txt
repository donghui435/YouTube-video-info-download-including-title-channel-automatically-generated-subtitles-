hi so in last video we have learnt howto convert a fraction into percentageand in this video we are going to learnhow to convert a percentage intofractions so definitely it is easiest toconvert a percentage into fractionswhy because percentage is nothing butthe numerator of a fraction whosedenominator is 100 so suppose if we wantto convert 6 1 by 4 percent intofraction what we have to do this is whatthis is nothing but the numerator of afraction whose denominator is 100 rightand now if I convert this mixed fractioninto improper fraction it will be sixfours are 24 plus 125 by 4 the wholething is divided by 100 right and thiscan be written as 25 by 4 multiplied by1 by 100 right yes and this is nothingbut 5 fives are twenty five five to the1005 has a 5/5 fours a 20 so this willbe equal to 1 by Eckstein right so 6 anda quarter percent is nothing but 1 by 16of the whole right and this is equal towhat 6 and a quarter percent and nowlet's do one more example to understandit better so I am erasing this andsuppose now if I want to convert 125percent into fraction what we have to dothis is in person so this will becomethe numerator of a fraction whosedenominator is hundred right and five tothe 10 5 5 25 5 to the 10 0 5 5 to 25 5fours are 20 this is nothing but 2 pi by4 or if I write it in mixed fraction itwill be 4for one before one and quarter so 125percent can be written as one andquarter of the whole right so this isthe conversion of percentage intofractions so to convert a fraction intopercentage what we have to do we have tomultiply the fraction by 100 or we haveto multiply the numerator of thefraction by 100 and after solving itwhatever we get will be the percentagevalue right and when we are converting apercentage into fraction what we aredoing we are dividing that percentagevalue by 100 and after solving that wewill get a fraction that will be thefractional value of that person H and inthe fundamental of both these actionslies the statement the statement ispercentage is the numerator of thefraction whose denominator is 100 rightso this was the conversion of a percentto fraction and in next video we aregoing to learn how to convert a decimalinto percentage
