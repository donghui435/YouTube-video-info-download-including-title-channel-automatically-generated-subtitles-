so a conditional statement is an if-thenstatement okay so if blank then blankright so if the hypothesis then theconclusion right and we can think aboutthis and this might help you when you'rememorizing these different statements akind of abbreviated here so if P then Qyou can think of the arrow as like thenso if P that's the hypothesis then Q theconclusion now what the converse is whenI think of the word converse I think ofin Reverse okay so you're basicallysinging it backwards you're saying if Qthen P right so you're actuallyreversing or interchanging thehypothesis and the conclusion so it'slike saying it in Reverse the conversenow just because the conditional is truedoesn't necessarily mean that theconverse will be true okay so that'ssomething to pay attention to now withthe inverse the inverse you keep thehypothesis and the conclusion in theirsame spot right if P then Q but whatyou're doing this little symbol here isyou're negating the hypothesis andconclusion you're saying not P then notQ okay so when you add that word not inthere you're making it that the oppositeyou're basically negating it and thenthe contrapositive what you do with thecontrapositive is you actuallyinterchangeokay the hypothesis and the conclusionand you're negating both the hypothesisand the conclusion so this reads likethis if not Q then not P now the thingto remember and this will be helpful foryou is that the conditional and thecontrapositive they have the same truthvalue which basically means that theconditional is true the contrapositivewill also be true the conditional isfalse the contrapositive statement willalso be false so they have the sametruth value same thing with the converseand the inverse okay they have the sametruth value they're both true or they'reboth false you can't have one be trueand the other one you know be false andthen the last one here the byconditional statements you can see Ihave a double arrow here and what thatmeans is that if P then Q is true Q thenP will also be true so it means it'strue forwards and backwards so usuallywhen we think of the arrow we think itonly flows in the direction of the arrowso if P then Q but this is saying thatif Q is true then P will also be trueand the way we read this is we say P ifand only if Q so that if and only ifindicates to us sometimes abbreviatedwith iff okay indicates to us that it'strue forwards and backwards it's a byconditional statement let's get intosome examples and we'll talk about howto work with each of these so if youstudy then you will get a good grade sowhatever comes after the if that's ourhypothesis so you study then whatevercomes after the then that's yourconclusion you'll get a good grade so inour diagram here if P then Q that's ourconditional statement okay so if youstudy then you'll get a good grade whatwould the converse be okay can youfigure that out the converse is going tobe going in reverse if you get a goodgrade then you studied but that's notnecessarily true right you could havegotten a good grade because the teachermade the test really easy or maybeyou're just naturally great at math oryou know one of those kinds of thingsnow what about the inverse what we dowith the inverse is we add the word notin there that's what negates okayboth the hypothesis and the conclusionso we're going to say if you do notstudy then you will not get a good gradenow notice we kept the hypothesis andocclusion conclusion in the same orderright all we did was we negated themokay now what about the contrapositivenow this sometimes gets a little bittricky but what you're going to be doingit's a combination of the converse andthe inverse here's going to be switchingthe hypothesis in the conclusion andyou're gonna be negating them so if weread this is going to be if you do notget a good grade then you did not studyand that's true if the conditional theoriginal statement is true okay soyou're with me so far let's go on toanother example if two angles this is amath example so if two angles form alinear pair then they are supplementaryso what's the linear pair well linearjust means line right and pair means twoso if you have two angles and they forma line then they're supplementary whatsupplementary mean it means that theyadd up to 180 right so if two anglesform a linear pair then they'resupplementary that's true right okaywhat would be the converse of thisstatement if two angles aresupplementary then they form a linearpair is that true well that's notnecessarily true because you could havean angle over here okay and an angleover here and you can see that they'renot forming a line they're not adjacentto each other okay they're not sharing avertex and array so they're not forminga line they're not a linear pair sothat's an example of the converse errorso just because you say something inReverse that doesn't mean it's true justbecause it's true you know forward as aconditional statement okay let's talkabout the inverse if two angles do notform a linear pair then they are notsupplementary is that true or falsethat's false right and the reason it'sfalse is because just because they don'tform a linear pair like these don't forma linear pair doesn't mean that they'renot supplementary they could still addup to 180 this could be a hundred andtwenty degrees and this could be sixtydegrees right okay how about thecontrapositive contrapositive we'regonna switch the hypothesis and theconclusion and we're going to negatethem both right so if two angles are notsupplementary right then they do notform a linear pair now that's truebecause if they're not supplementarythat means that they don't add up tohundred eighty degrees there's no waythat they could be forming a straightline okay a linear pair plus we knowfrom what we talked about earlier if theconditionals true the contrapositivewill automatically be true they have thesame truth value or if this is falsethis is false but since this was truethis is going to be true okay same thingthe converse inverse they go together tohave the same truth valueokay last example here if you'reenjoying these videos go ahead andsubscribe to the channel I'd love tohave you as a subscriber we've got morevideos like these coming so I want tohelp you to boost your score in yourclass and make math a little bit easierto understand but let's talk about thislast example if two lines form rightangles then they are perpendicularokay the two lines are perpendicular sofirst of all sometimes I like to draw apicture so if two linesform right angles okay so you can seethe 90-degree angles then the lines areperpendicular yeah that makes sensethat's true right let's say it backwardslet's say it as a converse statement iftwo lines are perpendicular then theyform right angles that's true too rightso what we can do is because it's trueforwards and in reverse meaning theconditional statement and the conversestatement are both true we can writethis as a by conditional statement bymeaning to conditional meaning it's aconditional statement at forward and inreverse so how do we do that let me seeif I can explain this what you do thisis what you want to do is you want todrop the if okay and you want to replacethe then with this phrase if and only ifso two lines form right angles if andonly if they are perpendicular makesense so you're dropping the if andyou're replacing two then with if andonly if and what that indicates tosomebody reading that statement is thatall this is true for words and it's truein Reverse so it doesn't matter if Iinterchange the hypothesis andconclusion it will still be a truestatement so again I hope you'reenjoying these videos subscribe to thechannel check out some of my past videosand I look forward to seeing you in
