let's say we have two thirds all dividedby five and this is exactly the same astwo thirds divided by five and many ofyou might get confused when you divideby a whole number but that whole numberis actually a fraction as well the fivecan also be written as 5 over 1anytime you divide by one it doesn'tchange anything so now in order todivide these two fractions I'm going tomultiply by the reciprocal of 5 over 1so the reciprocal of 5 over 1 is just 1over 5 so now I can multiply the twonumerators 2 times 1 is just 2 and 3times 5 is just 15 so now let's just goover one more example so let's say wehave 6 all divided by 3 over 2 this canalso be written as 6 divided by 3 over 2and once again if you get confused by awhole number of 6 you can actuallychange it into a fraction 6 is the samething as 6 over 1 so now to divide thesetwo fractions we just have to multiplyby the reciprocal so 6 divided by 3 over2 is the same thing as 6 over 1multiplied by the reciprocal of 3 over 2which is just 2 over 3 now we canmultiply these two fractions together 6times 2 in our numerator gives us a 12and we have a 1 times 3 in ourdenominator which just gives us 3 and ofcourse 12 over 3 can be reduced bothnumbers can be divided by 3 evenly soI'm going to divide the 12 by 3 andwhatever you do to the top you have todo to the bottom in our numerator wehave 12 over 3 which is just 4 and inour denominator we have 3 divided by 3which is just 1 and 4 overis just four so here are some morevideos with some more example problemsrelated to the video you just watchedI really hope you're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you later
