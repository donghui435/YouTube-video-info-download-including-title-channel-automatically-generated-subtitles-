now here I've drawn a circle and shownthe radius which I label R now if Istart from here and go round thecircumference and travel the same lengthas the radius here it's going to goround to approximately there judging bythat length okay and I'll label that arefor the radius that obviously isn't theradius but the length of that arc is thesame as the radius here if I join fromthe end here back to here that too isthe radius now I have an angle a turnfrom here to here okay and this angle inhere is often called the angle at thecenter of a circle subtended by an arcof length R and when this happens thisangle is called a Radian one Radian soI'll pop that in there one Radian nowobviously I could write one Radianinwards just like we write one degree inwords we have a symbol for degrees whichis a little circle but for radians thenotation that we use is one with alittle C or whatever the angle is with alittle C quite often though we get a bitlazy and we don't actually write the Cin so if you find that we're talkingabout an angle and it hasn't got thesymbol for degrees in and it's just leftas a number then we have to assume thatit is in radians so if you saw somethinglike three with a little C there we knowit's three radians if it had three thelittle circle there it's three degreesbut if it didn't have anything there wehave to assume that it's in radians okayso there we go we'll just put that eventhough for this example with a little Cthere one Radian then the anglesubtended by this arc at the center of acircle of radius R now how many radiansdo you think it takes to go around acomplete turn of 360 degrees welljudging by this diagram if I was to justtry and estimate it if I come round hereI think the next length of our wouldtake me to about barish so if I wentthere and then again around to aboutthere and then again to about there it'snot drawn to scale and another one toabout there another one to about there Iwould think you'll notice that I've gotabout one two three four five six and alittle bit more six and a bit radiansseem to be the equivalent of a turn of360 degrees well to calculate thisaccurately what I need to do is find outhow many times I can fit the radius intothe circumference and that will tell mehow many radians there are that areequivalent to one turn of 360 degrees solet's carry out that sum here it's justintroduced it as being the number ofradians okay in one turn in one turn of360 degrees well it's going to be calledtwo as we said the circumference okaydivided by the radiusI'm looking to find out how many times Ican fit that radius into thecircumference hopefully you remember theformula for the circumference of acircle it's 2 pi R and if we divide thatby the radius R you'll notice that thetwo hours cancel and that would leave uswith 2 pi and we estimated that there'llbe just looking at this about 6 and abit radians in one complete circle butin actual fact it's exactly 2 pi now piis just little over 3 so 3.14 say and so2 lots of 3.14 is going to give me 6 anda bit more okay so a little over 6radians but to be exact it's 2 piradians should really put a C there justto remind you that it is in radians sowhat have we got them we've got 360degrees is equivalent then to 2 piradians and from this we can get someother well-known results that you shouldtry and learn for instance 180 degreesis related to 360 degrees it's half ofit so half of 2 pi radians would be piradians just a little over 3 radiansthere you go look up here 1 2 3 and alittle bit more for a hundred and eightydegrees 90 degrees that's half of 180degrees so must be half of pi PI over 2radians pi being a little over 3 3divided by 2 1.5 just a little bit morethan one and a half radians to turn 90degrees we can build up this up and get45 degrees 45 degrees half of 90 degreesor a quarter of 180 degrees either wayit'sgoing to be PI over four radians thecourt of high other well-known anglesare 30 degrees 30 degrees is going to beone sixth of 180 degrees or the third of90 degrees again if I divide PI by sixthat will give me the 30 degreesequivalent to that 180 divided by six orI could do 30 degrees from the 90degrees a third of 90 a third of PI upon2 is PI upon 6 radians and if I doublethis I'm going to have 60 degrees forinstance 60 degrees doubling 1/6 is 2/6or third PI PI over 3 I could get 60degrees for instance by dividing ahundred and eighty degrees into threeparts PI over 3 again there's many waysthat I can get these very commonmultiples or fractions of Pi but fromthese as well we should be able to buildup as I say multiples of these anglesfor instance 30 degrees okay 30 degreesdouble it we get 60 degrees treble it wegot 90 degrees that's 3 lots of this 3PI upon 6 becomes PI upon 2 we get 120degrees for instance 120 degrees it'sfor lots of 30 that's 4 PI over 6 4 PIover 6 or 2/3 PI 2 PI over 3here was 1/3 pi 60 degrees if I do 2/3pi I must have to lots of 60 degrees 120degrees again anyway I'll leave it toyou to build up some of the well-knownanglesokay but this is essentially anintroduction to radians
