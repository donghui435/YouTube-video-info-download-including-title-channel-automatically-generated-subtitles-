In the late 1950¡¯s and 1960¡¯s people began
to experiment with the idea of computer tocomputer communication¡­.all information, no matter the form, is stored
in the computer¡¯s memory as a sequencesof bits.To send these bits they created hardware which
could transmit a clocked sequence of electricalpulses along a wire.On the receiving end the computer would capture,
store and convert the bits into the informationthey represent.Doing this with two computers, along a single
line, is quite simple.But of course, other people wanted to connect
their computers together, too.Leading to a computer network.One simple solution to make this network would
be to connect all machines to all other machines.but as you add more and more computers this
requires an impractical amount of line¡­plusit¡¯s incredibly wasteful.Telephone networks at the time took a more
practical approach, individuals were connectedto a Hub (such as a city switchboard) which
was a point through which many people couldconnect.At this hub would be an operator with a switchboard
would manually patch people together by closinga circuit between them (known as a circuit
switched network).So if PERSON A wants to connect to PERSON
B, they both get patched onto the long distanceline through the hub.the drawback of this method is nobody else
in the network can use the long distance lineuntil they finish their conversation.We call this line the bottleneck of the network.By 1972 the designers of what we now call
the internet were building ARPANET.It began as a small network of computers at
universities on both sides of the countryconnected together.So they came up with a clever way of weaving
computer conversations together.by breaking up all digital messages into chunks
known as packets.The job of the hub is simple: Send packets
as they arrive from various sources on a firstcome, first served basis.each packet labeled by its source and destinationOn the receiving end this weaving is undone
and the packets are put back into their originalsequence.Effectively squeezing multiple conversations
along the line at the same time...New cities were connected to hubs and those
hubs were connected to each other.So more and more digital data needed to get
squeezed down these long distance lines.But there is a fundamental limit to how many
bits you can squeeze down any line per second.This limit is known as the line capacity (or
Bandwidth).And as you add more and more and more households
to the network, then you¡¯ll run into a problemwe¡¯ve all experienced in traffic¡­.a waiting
line develops(waiting line visual)If you are watching a streaming video you
will notice these missing packets as unwantedpauses in your stream.To see exactly how this happens, let¡¯s do
a simple example and ignore all the peopleon the internet except one household.Imagine this household is watching a video
stream from Washington upstairs and downstairssomeone is watching an audio stream from California.The video packet could take THIS pathway and
at the same time the audio packet could takeTHIS pathway.No problem.But now let¡¯s add another household to the
network, in a separate city.And assume they also want the identical audio
and video stream.Perhaps they are popular shows.They have direct a pathway to the music source,
but they also need the middle path for theirvideo source.This causes a waiting line, or queue, to develop,
so the hub will transmit two packets downthe line, one after the other.This is what we mean when we say the network
is ¡®slowing down¡¯ - people begin to waitfor their packets due to queues which develop
at the hub.so The BIG engineering problem today becomes,
how can we make these queues at our bottleneckssmaller?In the year 2000 a seminal paper was published
(Ahlswede et al) and it¡¯s based on a cleverstrategy for what happens at the nodes in
a network...Instead of treating packets like cars, and
sending them one at a time.The idea was to treat packets as numbers.And blend them together using mathematical
operations, such as addition.Resulting in a new packet which contains a
mixture of information from more than onepackets.Think of these mixed packets as providing
clues about what¡¯s in themLet¡¯s return to our example to see exactly
how it works...Let¡¯s say the video packet being sent can
be represented by the number 1.And the audio packet can be represented by
the number 4.When the video packet hits the first hub,
it¡¯s the only one to arrive so it¡¯s sentunchanged along all the output lines.Same thing happens when the music packet when
it hits the first hub.But now look at the middle up, it receives
2 packets, and this time it adds them togetherand sends the result as a single packet.Notice now, both households receive their
packets just as fast for each household asif they were alone on the network!Finally the key step is to look at how we
can unmix these mixtures on the receivingend.Let¡¯s look at Household 1 first.It receives the video packet directly.to extract the music packet out of the mixture
it needs to SOLVE for the missing value, bydoing simple math we all learn in school.We know the Video packet = 1And the Video + Music packet = 5Therefore,The Music packet equals 4.And that¡¯s the great insight of this paper.We treat each mixture as an equation, the
receiving computer solves for the variables,or packets, it needs.This is in sharp contrast to how the internet
was originally designed.Because it allow smultiple packets to travel
the same line at the same time, instead ofhaving to get each packet in line and wait
its turnAnd this system practically works because
computers can now do basic arithmetic operationsneeded to solve these linear equations incredibly
fast, millions of times per secondBy 2020 it is expected that ~75% of network
traffic will be video streams and the trafficfrom mobile phones alone will be 30 exabytes.And we increasingly rely on our communication
networks for services that are consideredfundamental such as health, finance, education...Therefore solving problems related to network
congestion is critical.And network coding is a great approach because
it allows us to mix information packets insteadof having to get each packet in line and wait
its turn.This video presented the basic principle of
network coding in a simplified manner, butthere still exist many open questions, as
well as new applications to explore.Such as wireless networks, security, distributed
computing and storage.An active research area in information theory
today is how to best leverage this paradigmshift to network coding as we build our digital
future.END
