all right in this video we're going tolook at finding some sums of geometricseries if they exist so in Part A herewe've got the series from N equals 0 toinfinity of 1 over 5 to the N so in thiscase I'm going to rewrite it in equalszero to infinity I'm just going to writeit as 1 over 5 all raised to the N poweragain if we take 1 to the N power in thenumerator 1 to the N is just 1 so againin this case this is going to be aconvergent geometric series remember thenumber that's getting raised to thepower that's our R value so in this caseR is 1/5 and again these converge if ourR value is in between positive 1 andnegative 1 and they converge tosometimes people will write it as a over1 minus R I like to think about it asbeing the first term over 1 minus R andin this case well let's see if we plugin N equals 0 that's how we'll get ourfirst term we'll have well just 1/5raised to the 0 over 1 minus the R valuewhich again is 1/5 well 1/5 to the 0 isjust 1 1 minus 1/5 is going to be 4/5and 1 over 4/5 gives us 5 over 4 thatwill be the value of our convergentgeometric series
