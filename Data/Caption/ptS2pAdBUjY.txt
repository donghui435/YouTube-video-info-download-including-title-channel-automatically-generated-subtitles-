hi this is Mario with Mario's mathtutoring coming to you with another mathvideo to help you boost your score inyour math class improve yourunderstanding and hopefully make math alot less stressful so in this lessonwhat we're going to talk about isbinomial probability so what is binomialprobability and how do we work with itwell okay binomial probability basicallymeans that there's only two things thatcan happen like either you win or youlose or it's like you know you make theshot or you miss the shot or it's likesuccess failure okay it's like one oftwo options you know heads or tails thatkind of thing so if we take a look atthe formula here we've got n choose K Pto the K times 1 minus P to the N minusK so what what all these variablesrepresent well okay n represents thenumber of trials okay so the number oftimes you flip a coin or you know anumber of basket shots that you take orwhatever it is that you're working withokay and then P what P represents is theprobability of success as a decimal soif it's a 20% chance of success that's0.2 0 and so on and then 1 minus P isthe probability of failure so there's a20% success rate that means there's an80 percent failure rate because theyhave to add up to 1 right 200 percentand so K here represents you know thenumber of successes so you're wonderingif the probability that you know youmake you know 9 out of 10 baskets or 5out of 10 baskets that's the number ofsuccesses and then and minus K thatwould be the number of failures so we'lllook at some examples I'll show you whatI mean so let's take a look at thisfirst one if you make 70% of thebasketball shots you take what is theprobability that you make exactly 9 outof 10 shots okay so let's look at thisone so basically you're taking ten shotsso that's going to be 10 shoes we wantto make 9 right so this is 10 choose 9we know the probability of making thebasket is 70% which is 0.7 0.7 and wewant to make nine of those and then theprobability of missing okay are notmaking the shot is 30% so that's pointthree zero or 0.3and one of those so if we simplify this10 choose 9 is 10 factorial over 10minus 9 1 factorial 9 factorial and thenwe have 0.7 to the 9th and 0.3 to thefirst so if you simplify that out 10factorial divided by 9 factorial is justgoing to be 10 if you simplify that outthat's going to give you the probabilityokay so let's look at another examplewhat is the probability that if you flipa coin 20 times you get heads exactly 7times so we're not seeing 7 or morewe're just saying you know exactly 7 sosame idea here what we're going to do iswe're going to say 20 times so that's 20trials so you can see n is 20 and wewant to get heads exactly seven times soK is 7 we know that when you flip a cointhere's only two possibilities you knowit's either going to land on heads ortails and so that's going to be a 1/2probability we want to get heads 7 timesof course not getting heads would alsobe 50% or 1/2 okay getting tails andthat would have to be 13 of them okay soif you simplify this quantity you'regoing to get the probability as adecimal and then you can convert it to apercentage if you want to talk aboutpercent chance but again just with the22 7 this is 20 factorial over 20 minus7 factorial 7 factorial and then you cansimplify the rest of this here okay sothis is how you work with binomialprobability just remember it's when youonly have two options success or failureand you can use the formula here so Ihope you're enjoying these videos I hopeyou're learning something and gettingsomething out of it go ahead andsubscribe to the channel take a look atsome of my past videos and I've got morevideos coming here for you so stay tunedI'll talk to you in the next video
