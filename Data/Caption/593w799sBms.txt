welcome to new planet school we're goingto do a little more trigonometry in thisvideo what we're going to do is focus ona very central concept in trigonometrywhich is called the unit circlethis is a key concept that helps usdefine a lot of the trigonometricfunctions and make lots of interestingconnections to the different parts oftrigonometry and I would consider thisto be one of the more important conceptsso take your time we'll go through thisslowly and make sure that you understandit so let's get started on so who caresabout the unit circle trust me that ifyou understand this video you willdefinitely understand trigonometrybetter you will not have to memorizethings as much you will see theconnections between different conceptsand trigonometry and so forth oftenpeople want you to look at a unit circleand memorize certain facts about itthat's great if that helps you here willtry to understand how the unit circlehelps you understand trigonometry it'sbetter to understand it and then it'llobviously then make it much easier tomemorize anything that you want tomemorize about the unit circle and soit'll also help you remember usefultrigonometric relationships because ifyou can write down the unit circle andquickly label a bunch of points andangles you can therefore remember awhole bunch of different relationshipsand finally it will help you graph thebasic trigonometric function sine andcosine and tangent it's very easy if youcan just draw the unit circle you canfigure out the basic trigonometricfunctions and you can figure out how tograph them and how they're related andso forth so it gives you it's basicallya tool that will help you connect all ofthese concepts so let's get started soobviously we're starting off with theunit circle what you see here in yellowis obviously a circle that's prettysimple and the points as you go aroundthe circle have a value here this pointis 1 0 this point up here is 0 1 thispoint here is -1 0and this point here is 0-1 and what younotice is that the length from thisorigin to any point on this circle has alength of 1 obviously this has a lengthof 1 this has a length of 1 this has alength of 1 and so forth and of coursethat's why it's called the unit circlelots of other circles but this is theone that we're going to be talking abouttoday is the unit circle ok so let'stalk about the definition of a circlebefore we even get to trigonometry whatdo we know about circles in general sowhat we can do what do we know what weknow is this is a circle and sotherefore we can write certain things ifthis is a point XY on the circle somearbitrary point one of the things thatwe know right away is that x squaredplus y squared equals the radius squaredthat's the general formula formula thatdescribes a circle that's centered atthe origin in our case we have a unitcircle so for us one of the things weknow is x squared plus y squared equals1 because that's our radius so for ourparticular circle we have this verysimple relationship and this describesall of the points here so you can checkit here let's just check this point xsquared is 1 squared plus y is 0 0squared and of course that equals 1 samething here 0 squared plus minus 1squared equals 1 and you can check allthe points and of course all of thepoints in between also satisfy thisrelationship so if you're ever confusedabout how to find a point on this circleone of the things you know is it willsatisfy this particular relationship andthat of course is the definition of aunit circle so one way to check yourselfif you want to know if you think youwant to know what this point is you knowright here on the circle you want tocheck it to make sure that it makessensemake sure it'sI despise this because that's thedefinition of unit circle so it's notsomething that we'll use over and overand it's a good way to check your workand to check your the the angles andpoints on the circle that will be comingup with shortly okay that's a unitcircle let's talk about angles anglesare really important so let's talk aboutthat we could use degrees and of courseyou remember degrees you usually measurethings in terms of like here I have aprotractor this is zero degrees here's45 degrees here's 90 degrees and soforth this is obviously 180 it got kindof cut off and if you had if you kept ongoing you would get to 270 degrees downhere and if you go all the way around acircle you get to 360 degrees now youprobably know all of this because we usethings like a 180 or he did a 360 andyou understand these concepts of degreesbecause we use this in everyday life andso you're probably pretty familiar withthis but in trigonometry we also usesomething called radians which isprobably something you're not asfamiliar with and it's probably a newconcept to you it's a new way ofmeasuring angle so how what is what doesit do okay what it does is the followingsuppose we have here our unit circle andwhat we do is we vary this angle righthere and as we vary this angle what wedo is we measure the length of this arcand what we do is we stop when thelength of this arc equals the radius andwhen this arc length equals this radiusthen that angle is by definition oneRadian and this is you know sort of anew concept but it's extremely useful intrigonometry and even though you knowyou might you know think in terms ofdegrees and everyday life trust meyou're going to want to understand radioand use them and go back and think aboutthis and draw it for yourself and try tounderstand what radians mean let me giveyou an interesting example suppose thishas a radius of one and we go all theway around this how many radians wouldthat be so if this is zero radians and Igo all the way around how many radiansis this and we're going to talk aboutthis here shortly but that's somethingto keep in mind how many radians as yougo all the way around would beequivalent to 360 degrees and so let'slet's figure that out okay so degreesjust to review that again okay zerodegrees pretty obvious typically we willmeasure things from this line right hereand we'll be going up this way so thatwould be zero obviously 90 is theperpendicular 180 I do a 180 I go allthe way around 270 three-quarters theway around and of course like all theway around I reach 360 degrees and I'mback where I am and so then I just startover zero again 90 again 180 again 270again 360 start over 90 and so forth andso it repeats itself over and over andover again so those are the main anglesI need to know obviously it should beobvious that if this is 90 you knowhalfway should be 45 and then I can goaround instead of going around by 90s Ican go around by 45 and so let me showyou what that looks like I have theseother degrees and so I can draw a unitcircle and then in degrees I can quicklyfill out all of these angles 0 45 90 135180 225 and so forth as you go all theway around so that's how we can labelsome of the most important angles on theunit circle in degrees because we'reusing degrees here now let's go now toradians now this is a little bit morecomplicated and so let me give you alittle trick that will help you alwaysremember howradians how many radians are therearound a circle well if you happen toremember that the circumference of acircle is 2 pi times the radius if youdon't know that now you do therefore forthe circle that we're going to do wehave that the circumference equals 2 pitimes the radius which this is a unitcircle so that's 1 so the circumferenceis 2 pi in other words the distance allthe way around this circle has adistance a circumference of 2 pi now ifyou remember what the definition of theRadian is is it's when the arc lengthequals the length here and that would bethat many radians so if the arc lengthis 2 pi as you go all the way aroundthen the angle as you go around is thesame thing and therefore that angle is 2pi and so we automatically know this is2 pi by using this fact that thecircumference of a circle is 2 pi R wehave a unit circle and a Radian has thesame number of angles as it has an arclength so we just use those facts easyway to remember so now I know this is 2pi therefore half of it is PI half ofthat is PI over 2 and then using that Ican figure out that 3/4 of the wayaround is 3 PI over 2 and so I caninstantly figure out using thisrelationship as a trick not really atrick but is really telling us howangles are related to arc length whichis what radians do and then of coursefrom there I can go a quarter of the wayaround each of these and I get theseother angles here PI over 4 is half wayif I go half way between these twoangles I get 3 PI over 4 and so forthand so you can then very quickly drawthe unit circle remember that 2 pi isallthe way around and then you can justfigure out what all of the other anglesare in radians and then of course it'dbe useful for you to get a piece ofpaper and a pen or pencil and draw theunit circle and next to all these writedown how many degrees it is and thatwould be a really useful way for you toremember how degrees and radians areconnected because the units are reallyimportant when you're doing trigonometryand you're using a calculator don'tforget to select the right units or youwill get the wrong answer so keep thatin mind it's a handy little tip okay solet's move on trigonometric functionsnow we have a unit circle we've beentalking about this unit circle here andso what we're going to do is we're goingto say we're going to notice that I havethis line going up here to this pointand at some angle theta and what I'mgoing to do is I'm going to ask myselfif this as a point is the point is thatX Y in other words this length is X andthis height is y if I happen to knowwhat this angle is could I figure outwhat X is and can I figure out what Y isthat is really the question oftrigonometry and the question of thetrigonometric functions so let's see ifwe can figure out at least how to relatex and y to this angle so you can imaginethat the ultimate goal what we mightwant to do is you might have to like youdon't want to have a table angle x and yandwe want to be able to say theta zero PIover 4 PI over 2 and so forthand we want to know we want to be ableto fill in these particular values thatwould be a very useful thing to be ableto do and that basically relates thisangle to this point that is the questionwe want to answer the trigonometricfunctions give it a theta how do I getthat point or vice versa if I have thispoint how do I get the angle so let'stry to figure out how to do that ok sothe way we're going to do this is we'regoing to just define a function calledthe sine function and a sine function iswritten this way this is the sinefunction which we abbreviate as si N andwe don't know what this is yet we haveno idea what it is we're trying tofigure that out but what we're going todo is we're going to define it to bewhat's called the opposite over thehypotenuse so let's take a look at thisI'm going to clear this up and I'm goingto explain very precisely what thismeans now remember that this the wayI've drawn this this is a right that isa right angle and therefore this wholething is a right triangle okay andbecause this is a right triangle thisthing over here is the hypotenuse okayso that is a way of just labeling thistriangle to right triangle it's one ofthe simplest triangles we know a lotabout it in this case we know thehypotenuse equals one so that's verynice that's one of the nice things aboutusing a unit circle and now what we'regoing to do is what we're going to sayis this function whatever it is we don'tknow what it is we have to figure it outbut what we will say it is is that thesine of this angle equals the oppositewhich notice that equals y over dividedby the hypotenuse okayso I went from opposite over hypotenuseto the height which is Y divided by thehypotenuse which is one because it'sunit circle anything divided by one is yand so what we see is it basically theheight here Y is given by sine of thetaso let me clear this up and let me tryto write this out so if we wanted to dotheta x and y what we know is whatever Yis is by definition the sine of thetanow we have we don't know what this isyet but whatever it is it's the functionthat if we give it if we know what theangle is think about it this way we havetheta and we stick it into a box it doessomething called the sine function on itand that will return Y in the unitcircle this value similarly if I do thesame thing I can do the cosine and I gothrough the same argument and the cosineis adjacent divided by hypotenuse so ifthis is my angle this is adjacent whichis equal to obviously X divided by thehypotenuse which is equal to one and soif you do that you end up with thisrelationship cosine of theta equals x sosame thing I have theta I stick it intosome machine that takes the cosine ofthat and that cosine function willalways give me X again I still don'tknow how to do this I probably have touse a calculator or something to do thisbut this is what these functions do yougive it an angle and they will give youY you give it an angle in it will giveyou X and so from this through the sinefunction you get Y from this through thecosine function you get X and that ishow we're able to connect the angle tothis angle right here to this point it'sjust the definition at this point okaynow the tangent which is down here rightdown here is simply defined as the sineover the cosinewhich is y over X and if you work thatout that is also the opposite over theadjacent so let me clear this clean thisclean this up a little bit so thetangent function the tangent of theta isthe opposite which is equal to Y dividedby the adjacent which is equal to X thislength divided by this length and youcan just see that that is the same thingas sine divided by cosine so if wehappen to want this quantity we woulduse our calculator and look up thetangent function we would give it anangle we would do the tangent functionand the tangent function on thecalculator would be called 10 and itwill return this particular value okayand so that is how the we can relateagain this is the main point how to gofrom this angle to this point using atrial right triangle okay so let's justlabel those this is then cosine andtangent just so you can see it writtenout if this is sine if this is Thetathis is sine theta and this is cosinetheta okay now how can you remember thisonce you've drawn this unit circle outdrawn the right triangle and rememberedall of this how are you going toremember thisa simple pneumonic is called sohcahtoawhich is something you can just rememberit says kind of a funny name maybe itsounds like somebody's name sohcahtoaeasy to remember and what it refers tois that is its sine is opposite overhypotenuse that's this okay cosine isadjacent over hypotenuse so let's writethat out I didn't actually write it outover here and tangent is opposite overadjacent opposite over adjacent so ifyou remembersohcahtoa you can remember thisrelationshipthis relationship for cosine and thisrelationship for tangent so that's anice little trick to figure that out butthe main point here is simply toremember that what the trigonometricfunctions are related to the unit circlejust is how to get from this angle tothis value requires these functions thattypically you'll use your calculator tofigure out and so that's the whole ideaokay so let's move on let's take alittle break that was a lot to learn andso it's probably good to take a littlebreak I don't usually have a break inthese videos but I think this timethere's a there's a lot to learn and solet's take a break what we're going todo is we're going to do something reallyeasy because that was kind ofcomplicated you probably want to watchthat several times we're going to besaying really easy we're going to do 1plus 1 equals 2 just to clear our headsand do something easy well I'm going toshow you in this little break is how towrite 1 plus 1 equals 2 and probably themost complicated way you can imaginegiven things that you already know ok sowhat I'm going to do is I'm going towrite down these relationships soactually what I'm going to do is I'mgoing to do 1 plus 1 equals 2 but I'malso going to do 1 plus 3 equals 4 andif 1 plus 3 equals 4 or 3 plus 1 equals4 2 I might as well go ahead and dothese while I'm doing 1 plus 1 equals 2very simple just arithmetic I'm going towrite this in a complicated way what I'mgoing to do is I'm going to note thatany number X when I take the square rootof it and then square it I just get Xback so I can actually take thesenumbers and just put a square root overthem and square them and I haven't doneanything and I can write it in this wayover here that looks very complicatedbut I've done absolutely nothing it justlooks messy ok then the next thing I cando is I can say you know why don't Iclean up the right-hand side I'm justgoing to clean this up what I'm going todo is I'm going to takethis number I'm gonna divide it throughthis number I'm going to divide itthrough in this number anybody throughjust to clean it up a little bit andI'll write it over here in the lowerleft corner so they have this nice setof ones right here and then I have onthem on the left hand side somethingthat's very messy messy that's what Iwanted I wanted to figure out a messyway to write this relationship and Ithink I did it now I'm going to evenmake this a little bit simpler typicallywhen we write these types ofrelationships people tend to not like tohave square roots in the denominator sothey move it up by multiplying the topand bottom by square root of Y you getthis relationship so that allows me toremove some of these radicals that aredown here and and these guys all justcombine okay so let's see what thatlooks like so what I have is this finalrelationship very very beautiful it'sjust one plus one equals two one plusthree equals four and three plus oneequals four rewritten why is itbeautiful I have all these ones overhere notice that they all have two twotwo two two and two and then this onehas two numbers that are equal to eachother and then this has a symmetry 1 1and square root of 3 square root of 3now the important thing to note herethis kind of interesting is notice thatall of the forms in here take the formof some number squared plus some othernumber squared equals 1 so that's kindof an interesting thing and so this issomething that it's fun to do for alittle break ok so back to trigonometrythat was some arithmetic sort of aninteresting way to write things morecomplicated but let's get back to whatwe're here for which is trigonometryokay so pythagoras pythagoras one of themain figures in in trigonometry told usa bunch of really interesting thingsabout triangles very important thingsand the unit circle is a great way tounderstand Pythagorasso let me show you howin the unit circle are connected andthis is going to help you really knoweverything you need to know about theunit circle okay so let's try to connectseveral ideas okay first thing isPythagorean theorem and if you haven'tseen it yet I'm just going to tell youwhat it is later it will actually do avideo on the Pythagorean theorem andprove it and so forth but just for todayyou don't really care where it came frombut what it says is is if you have aright triangle then what you have is oneof the sides squared so let's suppose Idraw a triangle here and say this is a Band just say C for the moment in generalplus B squared equals C squared andthat's always true for a right trianglethat's what Pythagoras taught us and sothat is a very interesting thing nowthat's that's a very general thing nowlet's talk about the unit circle whichis right here let's talk about the unitcircle which is what we're here to learnabout now the unit circle you rememberas I said earlier that all the points onthis circle because it's a circle allcircles obey this relationship becausewe have a unit circle we have thespecial case where this is just equal toone this describes a unit circle so allthe points x and y on this yellow circleall obey this well this equation looks aheck of a lot like this equation rightand the reason for that is that thispoint is part of this triangle okayso what it tells us is is suppose wewant to generate values along thiscircle like what is for example what isthis point right here what is this pointwhat is this point how would you figurethat out one way to figure it out is youknow it's on the unit circle so it'llbase this and it is also I can always goin and I candraw right triangles I can always makethese right triangles anywhere I wantand therefore I can always use thePythagorean theorem when I'm using thisand in fact the Pythagorean theorem whatyou normally think about as beingassociated with right triangles and ifyou didn't know that you will by thetime you see the Pythagorean theoremvideo but now you know that is the samething as the unit circle because it's atriangle embedded in a circle andtherefore circles and triangles areintimately related now that should allowus to generate useful points on thecircle why because we know that all thepoints on this circle satisfy x squaredplus y squared equals 1 so let's cleanthis up and let's look at some of thatok all right so here's Pythagoras okhere is the general equation for acircle and here is the unit circle oknow we're in a position to relate thatduring our arithmetic break notice thatwe generated through that that littlebreak a bunch of equations exactly ofthis form these are exactly of this formand if these have this form then thismust be a legitimate X and this must bea legitimate lie on this circle andtherefore these this is an X this is anX this is an X this is y this is a y andthis is y because they all satisfy theunit circle relationship and we figuredout what these points were simply bydoing some arithmetic during our little1 plus 1 equals 2 break so that is a wayto generate points on the circle solet's see what that looks like okay soI'm just repeating over here what we hadthese are some of our points that wegenerated in our arithmetic break theyhave to lie on the unit circle becausethey follow the form x squared plus ysquared equals 1 we just need to figureoutokay so let's take this point right herewhich is halfway between zero and PIover two or zero and 90 and because it'shalfway one of the things that weautomatically know is the X and the yvalue must be have the same value andnotice that this point therefore at PIover four which is half of PI over twomust be this value because it's the onlyone that's halfway PI over four ishalfway therefore this has to equal thiswhich has to equal this which has toequal this okay and notice that this onecame from this relationship okayso let's clean that up and go here's theother one and here's the other oneand so we can see again this value righthere came from here this is X this is yand this one right here came from thisequation so now we know how to generatevery simply we know how to generatepoints on this circle in addition youknow before we started off with thisthis is just ones and zeros wasn't veryinteresting now we can start to fill ina lot of points on this circle nowhere's the amazing thing we clean thatup and go down here look at this noticeyou will recall that any number if it'splus or minus squared doesn't doanything so I can put a minus X in hereand it wouldn't do anything similarly Icould put a minus y here and it wouldn'tdo anything I can have a plus a minus Xhere and a plus y there and it wouldn'tchange anything and that generates allthese other points that are along thecircle so for example a perfectlylegitimate point right here is minussquare root of 2 over 2 square root of 2over 2which is essentially the mirror image ofthis point I just put a minus sign inand it still satisfies the equation ofcircle so it must be there somewheresimilarly I can pick this point which iswhen I put- signs in front of this value and sothis is sort of the mirror point forthat one and I won't draw all of thembut each of these it has a mirror hereas a mirror here as a mirror here and soforth so what it means is if youunderstand and remember these pointsright here and just remember that I canput a plus or minus or minus and a plusor a plus and a minus or minus and minusor a plus and a plus you can generatethese three these three these three justknowing the values up here and rememberthe values we came up with up here wassimply by through our little arithmeticbreak figuring out what are some numbersthat when we square them give us one andthat would tell us some of the pointsthat lie on this unit circle so veryuseful way to remember how to get thesevalues now here's the other interestingthing let me clean this up to rememberhere is this notice that when I when Idraw up this way notice that thistriangle right here the x value issquare root of three over two the Yvalue is 1/2 okay look at this trianglethis triangle has exactly the oppositethe x value is 1/2 and the y value isloop's square root of three over twothese two triangles this triangle andthis triangle are the sameand therefore this triangle here andthis triangle here are the same you canalso prove which I won't prove it hereright now but you can trust me you canprove it that this triangle in betweenis related to these two triangles insuch a way that you can prove that thisangle and this angle divide this intothirdsand if this is let's let's use what doyou want to use let's use degrees we usedegrees right now so this is 90 and thisis divided by three then this must be 30degrees and this must be 60 degreesokay just because we can see and you canactually prove I'm not proving it herebut you can see that this is breakingthis angle into three piecesso therefore this point must lie at 30and this point which is halfway must lieat 45 degrees and this point right heremust lie at 60 degrees and you can seehow that argument comes about so this isall due to Pythagoras if you understandPythagoras which is the description oftriangles and how they're embedded inthe unit circle you should be able tosit around sit down with a piece ofpaper and a pencil and kind of come upwith all of this on your own and that'swhen you really understand the unitcircle and nothing to memorize of courseonce you've gone through this byyourself and really understand ityourself you'll probably end up havingit memorized so try to sit down and dothis for yourself and I bet you'll haveit memorized and if you don't you'll atleast know how to reconstruct ityourselfso okay so let's look at the angles sowhat we know is we have this point wehave this point we have this point andagain we had these other mirror pointsI'm again I'm not going to draw them allthe same same ones that I drew and nowwe know what these angles must bebecause they they divide either theangle in half or in two-thirds of 90 andof course if we know what's going onover here and what's called quadrant onewe can then continue around figuring outwhat the angles are over here now why isthis really important and really amazingmay not be obvious why this is reallyamazing but guess what we just figuredout we just figured out something reallyamazingwatch this well we figured out rememberwhat is sinesine of theta equals the opposite overthe hypotenuse and because it's a unitcircle that's the opposite over one andif this is our angle here the oppositeof that angle is the Y value so thatequals y so what did I just figure outby this very simple argument what Ifigured out is that sine for example ofPI over sixlet's do this lower one equals 1/2 thatis amazing I just figured that out andso now I'm actually starting to be ableto imagine doing what my goal was whichwas if I have theta and I want to figureout x and y I need to have a functionthat takes me from the angle to the Xand to the Y and now with functions arethe trigonometric functions sine cosineand tangent and I just figured out oneof those values I figured out somethingabout what this sine function actuallydoes and and that's some pretty amazingso okay so let's continuedoing this okay so here we have I movedit over here a little bit if youcontinue with this argument you can goall the way around the circle you shoulddo this and you can figure out all ofthe rules from all the values of thepoints on the circle now you know whatangles those points occur at and you canstart imagining knowing a lot about thesines and cosines and here is a wholebunch of different relationships they'reassociated with that so let's move onand look at how to graph these functionsso let's look at this let's just goaround this very carefully imagine wherewe have an angle that's 0 because wewant to know how to graph thesefunctions because now we're we know whatsome of the points are so let's see ifwe can figure out what the graph of itwould look like now remember that sinetheta equals the y-value it's thisheight right here for this righttriangle so if theta is 0 clearly I havea I don't really have a triangle sinetheta would be 0 because the Y valuewould be 0 so that would be this pointright here okay oh sorry it would bethis point right here sorry about thatkind of confuse this point right hereand as I go aroundclearly the Y value gets larger andlarger and larger as I go around untilfinally the Y value equals 1 so thiswould be at 30 degrees this would be at60 degrees this would be at 90 degreesand as I go around past 90 degrees the Yvalue is now less than 1 which is thisheight and it'll go back down again likethis and as I go around the circle itwill eventually come right back to whereI started as I go all the way around andthen it will from there it will repeatbecause the sine the sine functionis periodic very important thesefunctions are not just any function theyare periodic functions let's do thecosine cosine is the same thing actuallylet me clear this up to do that and soif I do the cosine same thing when thetais zerothe code is I don't really have atriangle it looks like this obviouslycosine is equal to the x value which is1 and so here's one and as I go aroundthe x value let me draw a tall one hereis shrinking and eventually as I gotowards 90 degrees the x value is 0 andso 30 degrees 60 degrees at 90 degreesat zero and it keeps goingit is also cosine is also a periodicfunction I go all the way around thecircle to 360 degrees cosine is alsoperiodic it's also a periodic functionand so what you can see this sort ofamazing is if you just draw a unitcircle remember that cosine is definedas this which is if you want adjacentover hypotenuse sine is defined as the Yvalue which for a unit circle is theopposite or the hypotenuse and yousimply just draw different points thinkabout what the x and y values are doingas you go from this point to this pointand on round you'll end up being able togenerate all of these points along thecircle and and on the pre one of theprevious slides we actually had we alsoknew what was going on at 45 degrees sowe would actually have some of thesepoints fill in two if you if wecontinued doing that sort of thing whatwe would get our functions that looklike this and so this is what the famoussine function and cosine function looklike if we could go through and do everysingle little point as we run around thecircle we would end up with graphs thatlook like this so if you ever want tomemorize what these graphs look like ormaybe you want to rememberwhich one starts at zero which onestarts at onewhen does this hit zero when does thishit one over here it's all really simpleas long as you remember this picture youcan simply draw this picture andgenerate all of this very easily sotangent is the same same way I don'tshow it on here but just remember thatthe tangent function this sine thetaover cosine theta and it will have asimilar property you can plot it as wellso let me actually show you what thatlooks like here is what happens here'san animation of the sine cosine andtangent functions being generated andplotted for youand you can see I go I go around heretwice I go around two pi and so two piis this point over here this final pointright here is 2 pi and I go all the wayaround and you can see how it'sgenerated now keep in mind these theselines right here aren't really part ofthe tangent function they're just partof the way the graphing program isgraphing this as it goes from up hereand then it discontinuously goes downhere and the reason for that is kind ofis like you know we have we have sinetheta over cosine theta and obviously ifyou look at this point when cosine istheta is zerothis is sine theta over zero which is areally large number and then it switchessine it's negative here and it goes topositive here and so it returns fromthis side and that's why the tangentfunction has this particular shape so okso in summary the unit circle is a greatway to understand how triangles areconnected to circles it's a great way tomotivate the sine and cosine functionsand so we've kind of used it here toactually define the trigonometricfunctions and it comes about in a verynatural way and an easy way tounderstand the easy way to remember nowif you refer get the trigonometricrelationships you can use a mnemonicsohcahtoa sine is opposite overhypotenuse cosine is adjacent overhypotenuseand tangent is opposite over adjacentand of course this is very general letme just tell you this is very generalwhereas for the unit circle it's alittle bit simpler we'll get to thislater because we have the hypotenuseequals one but this just keep in mindthat this is a very general relationshipso when you define sine and cosine andtangent not in terms of the unit circleit's worth still remembering thisbecause it's always going to be trueokay we also connected this with thePythagorean theorem and basically made aconnection between something that wenormally associate with a triangle witha circle because basically the the unitcircle is we embed a triangle in thereand we can make a connection and thatallows us to generate points on the unitcircle because they have to obey asquared plus B squared equals C squaredwhich we will talk a lot about later bywanting to make that connection now evenif you haven't seen it okay the unitcircle allows us to display the pointson the circle with the angle of thatpoint so we generated we drew the unitcircle and we figured out what a lot ofthe points were as we went around theirsquare root of 2 over 2 comma squareroot of 2 over 2 and we can generate allthose values and we can check by the waythat they obey for example x squaredplus y squared equals 1 so we had likesquare root of 2 over 2 square root of 2over 2 was one of the points let'ssquare that square of this is twodivided by the square of this which is 4plus this squared which is 2 divided by4 and of course this is 1/2 this is 1/2and that adds up to 1 so this is alegitimate point on that circle so thatwas an interesting way to generate thosepoints now once we draw the unit circlewhich you should be able to do it's easythen to plot all of the trigonometricfunctions and so what we do is there wejust draw the circle we go around and aswe go around we know what the values ofthese points were because we know nowhow to generate them from this and wegetsine and cosine and so forth and reallyimportant for many applications and mathengineering physics chemistry all overis the fact the very important fact thatthe trigonometric functions are periodicfunctions and in fact in terms of theiruse the trigonometric functions areoften used without reference to atriangle or without reference to acircle even but they're used tounderstand periodic functions and thingsthat are periodic like light waves andsound waves so that's a very importantthing to remember not all functions areperiodic very few of them are but sineand cosine definitely are what youshould do next is you should watch thewhat is it new planets cool video so youcan just now that we're getting intosome of these gory details of what thetrigonometric functions and go back andwatch this and remember why we're doingthis it's worth remembering whytrigonometry is so interesting and soimportant secondly watch this videoagain and draw your own unit circle ifyou go out on the web you can find emptyunit circles that look like a unitcircle and they have blanks and you canprint these out and you can go in andyou can fill them in yourself and youdefinitely should be able to do that ifyou just memorize the unit circle youshould be able to print one of those outand and simply just know how to fill itout but better would be to really watchthis video again and remember how togenerate these points to put put aroundthere so go out on the web and see ifyou can find a blank unit circle andempty unit circle and try to fill it inokay now the other thing you might wantto watch is the new planets cooltriangles video again just so you canremember that the triangles we've beendoing in this video are all righttriangles but there's a lot of differenttypes of obtuse triangles an acutetriangle isosceles triangles and justkeep in mind that there's a lot moredifferent types of triangles out therethan have a lot of different propertiesand we really haven't relied on all ofthem here the next obvious one is nowthat we know what the sine and cosinetangen are the next thing you should dois go watch this new planet school videosine cosine tangent where instead ofdefining these in terms of the unitcircle we really dig in and think aboutin a lot more detail what these threefunctions are what they mean what therules are and how to solve triangleswith them which is sort of the core ofwhat you do in for example your homeworkproblems in in your trigonometry classand and that will be a very usefulobvious video to do next okay so withthat thank you for being here at newplanet school and I hope to see you backhere for another video very soon
