there are four types of transformationsonly one of these is not an isometry andthat is a dilation so a reflection arotation and translation are allisometry x' which means when you performthe transformation you are creatingcongruent figures when you dilate afigure you are creating similar figureswhich means the angles are going to beconstant and the sides will beproportional to to each other when wedilate we need a scale factor we'll callthat n if n is greater than 1 then yournew image will be larger than theoriginal if n is less than 1 then yournew image will be smaller than youroriginal to do this you need a center ofdilation let's look at two examples tosee why center of dilation is importantwhen you go to the doctor's office andyou have your pupils dilate the centerof dilation is the center of your pupilso it starts off smaller and it growslarger so we're going to say that yourscale factor here must have been largerthan 1 if you have a point in space andyou are given a center of rotationyou're going to find your new point howby measuring this line segment betweenyour center of dilation and your pointand multiplying it times your scalefactor here we can tell that our scalefactor must be greater than 1 why isthat because our new point R prime isfurther away from our center of dilationthan the original let's say we had nless than 1 if we had our center ofdilation here and some point R if n isless than 1 we know that our new point Rprime will be somewhere on this linesegment but it will be closer to yourcenter of dilation the reason why centerof dilation is important is because if Ididn't give it to you you I could havedrawn our prime over here I could havedrawn our prime basically anywhere inthis plane and I would have dilatedaccording to my scale factor so againwhen you are dilating you need to knowyour scale factor and a center ofdilation if your scale factors largerone it will grow larger if it's lessthan one you will have a reduction
