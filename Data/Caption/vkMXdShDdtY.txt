ED COPELAND: Hello.BRADY HARAN: I was going to ask
you to describe this interms that you would describe
it to, say, your daughter.And then I remembered
your daughter doeseconomics at Cambridge.ED COPELAND: Yeah.BRADY HARAN: So let's
not do that.Let's describe this as you
should describe to me, maybe.TONY PADILLA: OK, so there's
been a very excitingbreakthrough in the field
of number theory.It caused an awful lot of
excitement amongst themathematicians, as excited as
mathematicians can get.And the crazy thing about it
is that it's come fromsomebody who's pretty
much unknown.It's a guy called Yitang
Zhang, which isa pretty cool name.And he does work at the
University of New Hampshire.ED COPELAND: It's about prime
numbers, the things thatcertainly got me into maths.TONY PADILLA: In fact, he really
struggled to get anacademic job.He worked for a time
in Subway.ED COPELAND: There are some
amazing properties of primes.And they've led to lots of
conjectures that haven't yetbeen proven.TONY PADILLA: There's nothing
wrong with working in Subway.But normally, these
breakthroughs are achieved bythose that are working at
Princeton, Harvard, thesekinds of really elite places.And now we've got somebody who's
literally come out ofnowhere, that no one expected to
produce this kind of resultand has done something really
impressive that many greatminds were unable to do.ED COPELAND: But one in
particular doesn't involvemultiplication of primes.It involves additions
of primes.And it's the fact that there
seem to be an endless seriesof primes which differ by 2.So the obvious ones are the low
number primes, so 3 and 5,and 5 and 7, 11 and 13.TONY PADILLA: So these two prime
numbers are called twinprimes and are called twins
because they differby this number 2.ED COPELAND: And then there's
a conjecture that goes backhundreds of years, which says,
actually, there's an infinitenumber of these.So the highest known pair
is a remarkable, right?3,756,801,695,685 times 2 to the
power of 666,689 plus 1 isthe higher of the
pairs of primes.And if I take away 1, it
gives me the lower ofthe pairs of primes.BRADY HARAN: That's epic.ED COPELAND: It's an epic.Just to remind you, the lower
ones that we were describingwere 3 and 5, and 5
and 7, et cetera.So to be able to do that and
show that that's a pair ofprimes that differ by
2 is remarkable.TONY PADILLA: So these ones that
differ by 2 are calledtwin primes.You also get, of course,
ones that differ by 4.These are called
cousin primes.And there's even those
that differ by 6.And these are called sexy
primes, which I think you'vedone as well.Why can't you have prime number
that differ by 7?BRADY HARAN: You can't have
prime numbers that differ by 7because one of them will
be an even number.TONY PADILLA: Exactly, Brady.Well done.So we know that there definitely
are an infinitenumber of prime numbers.And I can prove that for
you if you want.BRADY HARAN: We've done that.TONY PADILLA: You've
done that.I thought you had.OK, so you know that
there's an infinitenumber of prime numbers.What people aren't sure about is
that there are an infinitenumber of prime numbers
that differ by 2.But it's believed to be true.ED COPELAND: And so the goal
is to try and show this.And it's never been shown.But what has been shown, for
the first time, is that youcan bound the difference
between two primes.And somebody has shown-- in
fact, Yitang Zhang, from theUniversity of New Hampshire,
has shown that there is abound between two primes, let's
say one prime a andanother prime b.And that bound is that it can be
some number N. And so if Nwould be 2, for the case that
we're interested in here-- andthat's the ultimate case that
people are interested in.But what he's managed to show is
there is some number N forwhich for an infinite number
of primes, a and b, this isgoing to be less than or
equal to 70 million.BRADY HARAN: So just to be
clear, two primes can beseparated by more
than 70 million?ED COPELAND: Oh yes,
yes, yes, they can.But what he's shown is that--
and in fact, the conjecture isthat every single even number,
there is an infinite number ofprimes that can be separated
by that amount.So here, the even number
is 2, right?So the conjecture is there's an
infinite number of pairs ofprimes which are
separated by 2.But there's also a conjecture
that there's an infinitenumber of pairs of primes
separated by 4, and aninfinite number separated
by 6, and 8, andin fact, up to infinity.So that all the even numbers,
the conjectures are there arean infinite number of primes
separated by that amount.But no one has been able to
show that's true of anynumber up to now.And what he has demonstrated
is there are an infinitenumber of primes which will be
separated by a number N whichhe hasn't yet calculated, but
he knows that it's less than70 million.TONY PADILLA: There're an
infinity of these guys.[PHONE RINGING]TONY PADILLA: Oh, god.BRADY HARAN: What?Take two.TONY PADILLA: Hello.Hi, babe.I'm in the middle of
doing a video.Well, I've got to answer
it so it stops ringing.All right, call you back
when we're done.All right, see you in a bit.BRADY HARAN: Was that Ed?TONY PADILLA: No, it was--ED COPELAND: The mathematicians
who work onprime numbers will now, no
doubt, be scouring over whathe has done and trying to
knock this number down.I mean, I was already hearing
about one of the key peopleinvolved, a guy called Goldston,
who's talked aboutit might be immediately
possible to knock thisdown to about 16.And that's a lot closer
to 2 than 70 million.But of course, he has
a very nice way ofdescribing this value.Maybe 70 million means the
primes are not twins, butthey're certainly siblings.TONY PADILLA: But why
is it amazing, Ithink, is more the point.Why is it really incredible?Well, there's a sort of nice
way to illustrate this.One thing we know is that
obviously, there are aninfinite number of
prime numbers.But the gaps between the prime
numbers, generically, getbigger and bigger and bigger.In fact, you know that
for the first N--for prime numbers between 0 and
N, the average gap is oforder log of N. It's a function,
but this is a bignumber, is the point.It's not as big as N, but
it's a big number.OK, so let me illustrate what
that means in practice.So imagine you had a scenario
where you've got a world withall the numbers.And there's some rule--and I'm just going to impose
this rule because I'm king ofthis world--that says that prime numbers
can only fall in love withother prime numbers.OK, so the idea is that
you go on dates withyour nearest neighbors.And do you fall in
love or not?So for the prime numbers at the
lower end of the numberspectrum, they've got it made.3 gets it down with 5.7's getting it on with 11.They don't have to go
very far before theyfind their true love.But when you get up to, say,
googolplex, in principle, onaverage, you expect to go on of
order a googol dates beforeyou're likely to find
your true love.Because the prime numbers
are so far apart at thatlarge end of things.So it's a pretty loveless place
at that end of things.So you get to bigger and bigger
numbers, you mightthink there's just no
way you're going tofind your true love.And you probably won't even
bother going out of thehouse.You'd just stay
in and watchJeremy Kyle or something.But what is actually true,
though, what Zhang has shownus, is that for some lucky prime
numbers at that veryhigh end of things,
they actually--and it's always the case-- there
are some that actuallywill only have to go on about
70 million dates before theyfind their true love.So there are always some prime
numbers which are relativelyclose together.BRADY HARAN: 70 million seems
such an arbitrary number.ED COPELAND: Yeah.BRADY HARAN: And it's like, if
it's possible to explain, howhas that fallen out
of this proof?ED COPELAND: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.TONY PADILLA: OK, so when people
do number theory, howdo they actually go about
doing these proofs?They tend to use sieve theory.
