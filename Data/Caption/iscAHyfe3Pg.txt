so now I want to go over a trickymultiplying decimal there we have 0.34being multiplied by 0.23 so now I'mgoing to set this up so we can multiplythese together we have 0.34 beingmultiplied by 0.23 so remember our firststep we need to multiply as if thedecimals were not even there so let'smultiply these two numbers as if thesedecimals didn't even exist we have 3times 4 which is just 12 carry the 1 3times 3 is 9 9 plus 1 is 10 in oursecond line we need to place our 0 andwe have 2 times 4 which is 8 and 2 times3 which is just 6 and just like in anormal multiplication we need to add allthese numbers together 2 Plus 0 is 2 0plus 8 is 8 and 1 plus 6 is 7 so nowhere in our final answer is when we needto go back to our original problem andcount how many numbers are to the rightof the decimal in our first number point3 4 we have one number to the right ofthe decimal we have two numbers to theright of the decimal in our secondnumber point 2 3 we have one number tothe right of the decimal we have twonumbers to the right of decimal so wehave a total of 4 numbers started to theright of the decimal points so in ourfinal answer we also need 4 numbers tothe right of the decimal point howeverwe only have 3 numbers we have onenumber two numbers three numbers andsince we need four numbers to the rightof the decimal point we need to add a 0so now we have four numbers to the rightand we can place our decimal point andwe have a final answer of point zero 7 82 so here are some more videos with somemore example problems related to thevideo you just watchedI really hope you're finding mytutorials helpful so until my next videoI will see you lateryou
