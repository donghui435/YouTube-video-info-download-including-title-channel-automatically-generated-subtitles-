this is the number line we have zero inthe middle positive integers on theright and negative integers on the leftwhen we move towards the right on anumber line the numbers keep increasingand as we move towards the left thenumbers keep decreasing consider anyrandom number say 2 now choose anynumber 2 it's right safe 5 5 is greaterthan 2 now choose another number say foreven 4 is greater than 2 if we choose anumber to the left of to say 1 we cansee that 1 is less than 2 suppose wechoose minus 3 minus 3 is also less than2 here's a very basic thing to rememberright means larger and left meanssmaller and this helps us understand asimple concept every positive integer isgreater than any negative integer it'sbecause all positive integers are to theright of any and every negative integer
