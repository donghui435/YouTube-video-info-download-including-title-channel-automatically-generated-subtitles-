all right in this video I'm going to doan example of finding the equation for ahyperbola and again kind of our two sortof standard forms we can actually writethis a little more generically so I'llpoint that out here in this example sowe're going to find the equation forthis hyperbola here you know in thebottom left we can write the equation ofa hyperbola a little more generically bysaying X minus H squared over a squaredminus y minus K squared over B squared Hand K is going to be the point whereyour virtus M totes are intersectingokay it's going to be the pointequidistant from the vertices so to meit looks like the vertices here one twothree it looks like we have a one of ourvertices will be at 4 0 and the otherone will be at negative 4 0 okay itlooks like our asymptotes here arecrossing then at the point 0 0 so thatmeans my H K is going to be equal to 0 0so I can fill that in at any pointremember a that's going to be thedistance from your from your from wherethe asymptotes cross over to one of thevertices so to me in this case it lookslike our a value is going to be an avalue of positive 4 again we're justsimply moving four units to the right toget to that vertice so eight is four andthe last thing I'm going to use isremember our asymptotes are positive andnegative for this type the ones thatopen to the left and to the right we usepositive and negative B over aX but we know our a value in this casewe've already figured it out that's fourwe just need to figure out our V valuewell notice in this this our asymptotegoes through the points 2 1 and 4 2 okayso you go up 1 over 2 up 1 over 2 so tome it looks like the slope of this lineat least this this asymptote with apositive slope to me it looks like thisline has a slope of positive 1 over 2ok so again up 1 over 2 up 1 over 2 soour slope has is a positive 1/2 so ourasymptote is going to be 1 over 2 X wellI can rewrite this asymptote y equals 1over 2 X I could get a denominator of 4and if I multiply top and bottom by 2 Iwould get well 2 over 4 X as again thisasymptote since I know that my a valuehas popped my a value is positive 4 wellthen now this numerator must be our Bvalue so it says our B value is going toequal 2 and now we've got everything weneed to fill in the equation for ourhyperbola so it says we'll have X minus0 squared over a squared minus y minus 0squared over B squared which is 2squared equals 1 and you could alwaysmultiply this out it says our equationwould be x squared over 16 minus ysquared over 4 equals 1
