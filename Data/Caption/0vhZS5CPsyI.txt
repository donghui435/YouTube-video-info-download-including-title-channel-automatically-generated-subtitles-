a sphere has a volume of 288 pi find itsarea leave your answer in terms of pi tofind the area of the sphere rememberthat the formula for the area of asphere is 4 PI R squared so in order tofind the area we first need to find theradius of the sphere to find the radiuslet's use our given information notethat we were given that the volume ofthe sphere is 288 pi and remember thatthe formula for the volume of a sphereis 4/3 PI R cubed so we can set up theequation 288 pi equals 4/3 PI R cubednow to solve for R we first get rid ofthe fraction by multiplying both sidesof the equation by 3 on the right sidethe 3s cancel and we're left with 4 PI Rcubed and on the left side three times288 pi is 864 pi so we have 864 piequals 4 PI R cubed next to isolate theR cubed term we divide both sides of theequation by 4 pi on the right side thefuller PI's cancel and we're left with Rcubed and on the left side the PI'scancel andhundred and sixty four divided by fouris two hundred and sixteen so we havetwo hundred and sixteen equals R cubednow since we have an R cubed on theright side of the equation to get the Rby itself we take the cube root of bothsides on the right side the cube root ofR cubed is R and on the left side tofind the cube root of two hundred andsixteen we make a factor tree twohundred and sixteen is two times 108 108is two times 54 54 is two times27 27 is 3 times 9 and 9 is 3 times 3now since we're dealing with a cube rootremember that we're looking for groupsof three factors that are the same andnotice that we have three twos and wehave three threes so a 2 comes out ofthe radical and a 3 comes out of theradical and we have 2 times 3 or 6 so 6equals R which means that the radius ofthe sphere is 6 now that we know theradius of the sphere we can find thearea of the sphere which is 4 PI Rsquared by plugging in a 6 for the R inthe formula and we have 4 pi times 6squared which simplifies to 4 pi times36equals 144 pi so the area of the sphereis 144 pi
