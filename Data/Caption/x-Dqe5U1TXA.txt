What is the place value
of 3 in 654.213?So let's think about
that a little bit.And to do that, let me rewrite
the number, and I'll writeeach digit in a different
color.So we have 654 point-- we get
the decimal point-- 213.Now we're pretty familiar, I
think, with what goes on tothe left of the decimal point.We know that this right here--
let me do this in a neutralcolor-- is the hundreds place,
or we could view that as 10 tothe second.Let me write that a little
bit bigger down here.So this right here that is the
hundreds place, or you couldview that as the 10 to the
second's place, which is thesame thing as hundred.This right here is the tens
place, which is the same thingas 10 to the first. This right
here is the ones place, whichis the same thing as
10 to the zero.Then if you go one place to
the right of the decimalpoint, this represents tenths.This represents tenths, or we
could view it as 10 to thenegative one.Then, if we go to this magenta,
if we go two placesto the right, this represents
hundredths, or 10 to thenegative two.And then finally, this 3
represents thousandths.This represents thousandths, or
10 to the negative three.Now, just to answer the question
what is the placevalue of 3 in 654.213?The place value is
thousandths.That would essentially answer
their question.But to make sure that we really
understand what thismeans, I'm going to rewrite
this number.We can rewrite this
number as 600.We have 6 hundreds plus 5 tens,
or you could say plus 50plus 4 ones plus 2/10, plus
1/100, plus 3/1,000.Or we could write this, just
to really make sure weunderstand what we're talking
about when we mean placevalue, we can rewrite this
number as 6 times 100, plus 5times 10, plus 4 times 1-- I
keep doing that in the wrongcolor-- plus 2 times 1/10, plus
1 times 1/100, and thenfinally, plus 3 times 1/1,000.So hopefully, when you write it
out like this, it gives youa sense of what it means
we say place value.The 6, three digits to the left
of the decimal, is in thehundreds place, so it represents
6 hundreds.This represents 5 tens because
it's in the tens place.This represents 4 ones.You go to the thousandths
place, this 3 literallyrepresents three
one-thousandths.
