in this video I'm going to explain thereal reason why stick multiplicationworks also known as Japanese Chinese oreven lying multiplication while manymight argue that this method came fromChina Japan or even India I'm going toargue that it may very well have evenoriginated right here in Ontario Canadaconsidering how the curriculum suggestswe might go about teachingmultiplication but just for the record Ireally do have no idea where it camefrom and nor do I really care I dohowever really care about why thismethod works if you think it's a trickthat's only because you're looking at itfrom a procedural perspective aloneit all starts back at the good oldreliable method of organizing equalgroups and rows and columnsyou're right I'm talking about an array3 times 2 is the same as saying 3 groupsof 2 and we can show these 3 groups as 3rows and 2 columns or as 3 columns andtwo rows pretty cool righthere's another example here in Ontariothe grade 3 math curriculum tellsteachers that we need to give kids a tonof practice working with multiplicationconcretely and one of those veryimportant representations is usingarrays as numbers get bigger like 6groups of 7 it can often be helpful forstudents to show the number of groupsand number of items in each group alsoknown as factors like you see herenote that the arrangement might lookfamiliar as this is often how wetraditionally organized ourmultiplication tables or ourmultiplication charts as we build thisarray it's clear that one group of aquantity is equal to that quantity hereone group of seven is equal to 7 prettycool eh and I can continue buildingthese arrays to practice skip countingvisualizing doubles triples and allkinds of other useful skills that manyback-to-basics advocates would love tosee improved in our students now whilearrays are super cool we're not herejust to discuss the benefits of usingarrays when you learning multiplicationthey can also help us understand whythat stick or a line multiplicationactually works we'll get closer to thewhen we start looking at larger factorslike 13 groups of 14 it would reallysuck if we had to build an array withindividual tiles in this case luckilysomebody out there thought of base 10blocks to make building arrays withlarge factors easier let's have a lookat 13 groups of 14 again here werepresent 13 as 10 rods plus 3 unittiles so I've got one 10 rod and 3 tilesto give me 13 this reduces the number ofmanipulatives from 13 individual tilesto represent 13 to only 4 pieces prettycool way so as you probably guess it'lltake us only 5 pieces in order torepresent the number 14 a 10 rod plusfor single units now we can multiply inparts focusing first on our 10 rods justlike you do with a multiplication tablewe can multiply 10 times 10 and see thatthe space the product occupies is 100and with base 10 blocks we can use ahundreds flat instead of a hundredindividual units or 10 10 rods then wecan look at the empty space in the topright of our array and note that now wehave to multiply 10 from the factor of13 by the remaining 4 units from thefactor of 14 in order to get 4 10 rodsor a sum of 40 repeating the same logicfor the 3 remaining units from thefactor of 13 we then multiply 3 by the10 rod to get 30 or 310 rods andmultiply 3 by 4 to get 12 individualunits for a final product of 182 solet's do one more and then make aconnection to stick or linemultiplication this time we'll look at12 times 15 so 10 times 10 gives us ahundred or a hundred flat 10 times fiveis going to give us five ten rods or 50and we've now got 2 times 10 for 210rods ortwenty and two times five for ten and ifwe add up all of those partial productswe end up with a total product of 180pretty easy stuff right now let's goahead and make the connection first I'mgoing to hide the values of the base tenblocks since you've had some practiceit'll just clean up the screen a littlebit and now I'm gonna really startexplicitly outlining the gap betweeneach base 10 block so let's just spreadthem out a little bit or even going totoss in the lines now and you might beseeing where this is going because thatline or stick method ultimately is rightin front of our face right now but let'sget real explicit I'm just gonnaseparate our factors from the array justso we don't get confused so you'll seethat our factors are on the far left andat the top of the screen and our productis in the bottom right or the hundredrod and down and over now basicallystick or line multiplication is simplyskipping the step of drawing out thebase ten blocks by having you focus onthe intersection of the base ten blocksor the sticks or lines prior to medrawing in all of these sticks basicallywe're looking at the intersections ofall the white space between the base tenblocks so let's shrink these blocks downand have a closer look I'm gonna shrinkthese guys down and really focus in onthat intersection point so my 10 times10 gives me a hundred up in that leftcorner now if we look at five units fromthe factor of 15 and the ten rod fromthe factor of 12 which yielded us fivebase 10 rods 450 we're going to shrinkthese down and we're going to show themexplicitly that there are five points ofintersection between each linerepresenting those ten rods do the samefor the two units from the factor of 12and the ten rod from the factor of 15and we get to ten rods or twoagain producing two points ofintersection and finally the remainingfive units and the two units will yieldten points of intersection just likebefore we had ten tiles representingthat product we're just gonna put themright on top of the points and now youcan sort of see both the base ten blocksand the lines or sticks representing ourproduct so there you have it 12 times 15is 180 now if you've never built aconceptual understanding of howmultiplication works with arrays andbase ten blocks the use of stick methodwill always be a trick that will likelycause you errors and frustration at somepoint down the road however if you havea conceptual understanding behind whybase 10 blocks work you'll likely beable to use the stick method as a quickvisual representation which can serve asa conduit between the concrete and thesymbolic standard algorithm now why doyou typically see the sticks from theline method tilted diagonally wellthat's likely because many are using theline method likely have no idea why itactually works which is why you mightneed some assistance to organize thesolution however it also suggests you'reprobably going to make some errors downthe road or possibly even forget why theprocedure even works in the first placeso let's check this thing out if Iactually tilt this thing a little bitwhat you're gonna see is that your linesand sticks are now organized for someonewho doesn't understand because you allyou have to see is the intersectionpoints organized by place value here'swhat I mean the intersection pointrepresenting the hundred flat is to thefar left when we tilt our sticks in sucha manner these points all represent theten rods in the middle and these pointsin the far right represent individualunits so if we take a look at the sum Ihave a hundred in the first column orthe far left column I have 70 in themiddle column and I have ten in theright column but if we're dealing withplace valueright that represents we have 100 wehave seven tens and we have ten unitssince we can't have a number greaterthan nine in any column in base 10 wemust trade in the ten units for a baseten rod leaving us with eight ten rodsand zero units now while this is apretty cool trick it's also much morepowerful if students could articulatewhere it comes from and why it worksbetter yet after students have athorough understanding of arrays withbase ten blocksI'd much rather challenge them to see ifthey could come up with an easier way tovisually represent their two digitmultiplication on paper without havingto draw a bunch of rectangles andsquares some might use sticks for baseten blocks and maybe just maybe someonein your class might come up withsomething similar to this stick methodhow cool would that be oh and before yougo you should know that using base 10blocks to multiply is a great way toexplain why the standard algorithm formultiplication works let's have a lookif we look we have a look at the arrayand the standard algorithm side by sidewe can clearly see each step of thealgorithm first we start withmultiplying five by two to get ten thenwe look at five times one but wait it'sreally five times a ten since that onein the tens column is to represent theten rod so we get a partial product of50 then we move on to multiply one bytwo but wait again the one represents asingle ten rod to be multiplied by twoones that result will give us 20 andfinally the last partial product orchunk is multiplying one ten rod byanother ten rod or ten groups of ten forone hundred flat then we sum up thepartial products and we rive out ofproduct of 180 while we're at it weshould probably make a quick connectionto the standard algorithm we typicallyuse here in Ontario which basically hasstudents chunking the first two partialproducts togetherthe five times two and the five timesten for ten and fifty to get a result of60 notice that we had to carry a 1 formultiplying 5 times 2 resulting in a 10or a 10 rod as similar to steps in oneprocess is used when we multiply the 10rod from the 15 with the 2 from the 12giving us 20 and then the 10 rod fromthe 15 with the 10 rod from the 12 togive us a hundred or combining those twoto give us 120 all in that two-stepprocess however we still get the sameresult of 180 so while it might look awhole lot different than the arraycreated with base 10 blocks it really isa symbolic simplification of the processregardless of with which method you feelis most effective and efficient for youpersonally it's a great benefit to havea conceptual understanding as to why themethod you choose actually works insummary I'd like to talk aboutconcreteness fading which is a theorysuggesting that mathematical conceptsare best learned in three stages theinactive stage where students useconcrete manipulatives to represent themathematical concept they're working onover time after students have had enoughexperience physically working with theconcrete manipulatives they typicallymove on to the iconic stage where theybegin to often naturally draw visualrepresentations of the concretemanipulative instead of having tophysically hold and manipulate theobject in their hands as students becomeincreasingly comfortable with the iconicor visual representations it makes sensefor them to begin using symbols thatrepresent the meaning behind theprevious visual and concreterepresentations this stage is oftenthought to be the most abstract of thethree stages because now numbers andsymbols are used as an efficient way torepresent the work that has beencompleted in the previous two stages sowhat is the multiplication we justexplored today look like relative to thethree stages of concreteness fadingwell when it comes to single digit bysingle digit multiplication usingindividual unit tiles as we did at thebeginning of this video and physicallyarranging them into an array over timestudents don't have to grab thosemanipulatives anymore and instead startdrawing what might look to be what thosephysical manipulatives look like onpaper or in the mind's eye and thenfinally using more symbolic notation todo the work in their head as we move totwo digit by one digit or two digit bytwo digit multiplication it would beuseful to use physical base ten blocksto experience what it looks like andfeels like to multiply possibly movingtowards free virtual manipulatives likenumber pieces on the iPad by the mathlearning center the Ontario Ministry ofEducation x' math ease tiles app or theinteractive manipulatives offeredthrough the free knowledge of gameshowtools over time students will againbegin to skip using the concretemanipulatives and opt to start drawingthe array using base ten configurationon paper and possibly in their mind asthey become proficient doing thisthey'll begin using more symbolicnotation such as this conceptualmultiplication algorithm known to manyas partial products but ensuring thatstudents do not forget the kit how toconnect these pieces of the symbolicnotation to the inactive and iconicstages of concreteness fading orstudents might opt to use thedistributive property to chunk theirfactors into chunks that are comfortablefor them and start moving towards theman open area model to show their factorsand skip some of the inefficiencies ofdrawing each base ten rod and unit tileprior to moving towards the symbolicrepresentation of a standard algorithmagain noting that the area model and thestandard algorithm is in fact the sameprocess but simply a differentrepresentation and then finally anotherpossibility might be moving fromphysical base ten blocks to drawing avisual representation like the stick orline method we explored todayand then finally moving to some sort ofsymbolic representation in this casedecomposing numbers using mental mathand using the distributive property tomultiply 10 by 15 and then the remaining2 by 15 so I hope you found this videohelpful to not only help you understandhow the stick multiplication methodworks but also to share the importanceof building a strong conceptualunderstanding of mathematics throughconcreteness fading as we're exposed tomore ways to represent concepts inmathematics our understanding of thoseconcepts will continually deepen andproduce more and more connections overtime there are a ton of otherinteresting ways to multiply pleaseshare some of those in the comments forothers to enjoy thank you
