Welcome to the presentation
on i and imaginary numbers.So let me just start
out with a definition.i is equal to the square
root of negative 1.Or to view it another way,
you could say that i squaredis equal to negative 1.Now why is this special?Well, we knew or we've learned
that any number when yousquare it is equal to a
positive number, right?If I had negative 1
times negative 1, thatequals positive 1.You don't have to write the
positive every time but thatequal positive 1 and so
does 1 times 1, thatequals positive 1.So if we think about the square
root of a number, so far allwe've learned is taking the
square roots of positivenumbers, and that makes sense
to us because the notion of asquare root of a negative
number didn't reallyexist until now.So what we've done is we've set
this definition that the numberi, and i isn't a variable,
it's an actual number.It's value is equal to the
square root of negative 1.Now I won't go into all of the
philosophical musings aboutwhether i, as a number i, or
any imaginary numbersactually exist.Maybe I'll make another
presentation on that.But they exist enough to
be very useful to manyengineers and physicists.So I'll leave you with that,
and I'll also just hint at --well, I won't go into the
whole e to the i piequals negative 1.But that blows my mind,
but I won't go into that.And when you think about
whether i really exists, youshould also think about whether
anything really exists.So, I've diversed for too long,
so let's get back to what I wassaying before. i is equal to
the square root ofnegative 1, and i squared
equals negative 1.So let's think about the
implications of this.If I were to say -- well, i to
the first power, just likeanything else, is equal
to itself, right?i squared, I've already said
using this definition, isquared is equal to negative 1.i to the third power, well
that would just equal isquared times i, right?And i squared is negative 1, so
it would be negative 1 times i.And that just
equals negative i.And i to the fourth would
equal i to the third times i.I'm just using my
exponent rules here.Well i to the third is negative
i times i, right? i to thethird is negative i, and
then we just kept that i.Well what's negative i times i?Well that's the same thing
as negative 1 timesi times i, right?And what's i times i?Well, the definition.i times i, i squared, is
equal to negative 1.So that equals negative 1 times
negative 1, which equals 1.Interesting.Let me clean this
up a little bit.Actually let me start with
i to the zero power.i to the zero power, well we
know anything to the zeropower is equal to 1.So we'll keep that --
that still equals 1.i to the first power
is equal to i.i squared by definition
is equal to negative 1.i to the third power, I just
showed you, is equal tonegative i, and that makes
sense because that'sjust i squared times i.And i to the fourth
power equaled 1 again.If I did i to the fifth power,
well that's just equal to i tothe fourth power
times i, right?I'll write that down, i
to the fourth times i.i to the fourth is
equal to 1, right?This is equal to 1, so 1
times i is equal to i.Do you see a pattern here?i to the zero power equals 1.i to the negative
1 power equals i.i squared is equal
to negative 1.i to the third power
equals negative i.i the fourth equals 1 again.So i to the fourth equals i to
zero, and i to the one poweris equal to i to the fifth.I think you'll find out that i
to the zero, and you could trythis out if you don't believe
me, i to the zero is equal to ito the fourth, which equals i
to the eighth, which equals ito the twelfth, I think
you see the pattern.Any multiple of 4 equals 1.And i to the first equals i to
the fifth, equals i to theninth equals i to the
thirteenth, equals i.So that's i to any power
that is a multipleof 4 plus 1, right?Because 5 is equal to 4 plus
1, nine is equal to 8 plus 1.And we could do a similar
pattern. i squared is equal toi to the sixth, equals i to
the tenth, and so on, andthat equals negative 1.And finally i to the third is
equal to i to the seventh,which equals i to the eleventh,
and so on, equals negative i.So why is this useful?We see a pattern.It's a cycle of four.In this pattern, if we
look at this, we can usethis to determine what
i to any power is.So if I were to ask you what i
to the hundredth power is,well, you could just work it
out, you could say, well that'sjust equal to i times i to the
ninety-ninth andso far so down.But if we use the cycle,
we see that hundred isa multiple of 4, right?4 times 25 is 100.So i to the hundredth will
fall into this category,this first one.It's a multiple of 4.So we know that i to the
hundredth power is equal to 1.Similarly, if I said i to the
hundred and one power, that'sgoing to equal i, right?Because that equals 100 plus 1.So it puts you into
this category.Equal to a multiple of 4, 100
is a multiple of 4, and 101is a multiple of 4 plus 1.i to the hundred and second
power, similarly wouldequal negative 1.i to the hundred and third
power would equal negative i.I hope you understand what I'm
doing here, and all I did is Idefined i as the square root of
negative 1, and then Ikept multiplying i to
figure out a pattern.I said i to the zero equals 1,
i to the first equals i, isquared equals negative 1, i to
the third equals negative i,and i to the fourth
equals 1 again.And the pattern
repeated itself.And then I used that pattern to
be able to figure out i to anypower, even it's a
very high number.So a very simple way to think
about it is if I had i to thethree hundred and twenty three.What I do is I say if I
were to divide 4 into 323,what's the remainder?Well, I know 4 goes
into 320, right?4 times 80 is 320.So I know that when I divide 4
into 323, so 4 goes into 323 80times with a remainder
of 3, right?And the remainder is
what we care about.And this number is actually
called a modulus.Maybe I'll do another module on
modulus -- it's very importantactually in computer
programming.But since we know that when you
divide this exponent by 4 theremainder is 3, we can say that
this is the same thing as i tothe third, which we've
learned is negative i.Similarly, if I said i to
the five hundred and secondpower, well I know 500 is
divisible by 4, right?4 times 125 is 500.So the remainder is 2 if
I were divide it by 4.So I could say that this is
the same thing as i squared.And i squared we learned by
definition is negative 1.If I were to ask you i
to the thirty-seven?We know 36 was divisible by
4, so the remainder is 1.So it would be i to the
1, which equals i.Hopefully that gives you an
indication of what i is.It might have been confusing
the first time because we'redealing with a number that's
"imaginary," and I'm teachingthe cycle property of it.What you might want to do is
review the video again, butthen after that you could just
try the module on i, whichessentially just keeps working
you through thistype of problem.I hope you have fun.Bye.
