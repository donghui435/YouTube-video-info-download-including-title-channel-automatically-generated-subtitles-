have one missing Mele you've been mypatient reflection excellent all rightsir reflection now let's have anotherword for a more common rather lesstechnical one you know very niceyou flip something upside down or backto front guineas reflected the otherwords that yeah Mira very nice I likethat okay I think there's a bunch ofreally good city names for itwhat's the idea what ingredients do youneed not think about this one carefullyany directions and distances here weneeded an angle an injection of a pointhere right what do you need if you wantto reflect something so what youactually need is a line a straight lineokaystraight line okay once you've got thatstraight line you'll know where you getfor example let me draw some reallyrough ones over here if I have myrectangle here right and I reflectacross now you'll need your ruler forthis one how am I gonna work out exactlywhere I'm going to go now get your rollup get your roll up now rectangles areeasy because rectangles are defined bythese one two three four corners rightso what you want to do for each corneris is take your ruler and then draw aline from the corner to the line that'sbeen provided to you okay now here's animportant thingyou control lots of lines from here tothis line but I only want one I'll lookthe shortest one how do you know it'sthe shortest one there's a word thatwe're looking at for shortest distancehow like for instance I can already tellyou that that's not the first distanceright and neither is that right there'sonly one that iswhat is it's a wedge tiny reason it'sanother big one where we learn tountangle like parallel the arishokperpendicular good okay this is veryclose to travel so he's really going todo we're gonna draw our line across andwe want to make sure it's perpendicularto the straight line like so see thatnow you can see at least on mine I don'tknow if you can see my ruler big enoughit's a it's fourteen centimeters awayfrom the straight line okay so to makesure I do the flip to reflection I wantto go another 14 centimeter this wayokay so you can see this line and thisline are the same lengththat's really important so if I havethis point over here it's now gonna endup over there and I'm gonna repeat thisprocess all the way I'm gonna go acrosshere get a new point you can see what'sgonna happen okayso I'll show you exactly I just want togive you a general overview of how itworks okay I'll show you exactly what'srequired for each one when we zoom itall the more detail okay so on yourreflection the being is a nice metaphorwe need this straight line to go to andso this to our cells a diagram with theare again okay let's go this way let'sdo it a bit differently no no let's justgo in this direction if I draw the linehere okay there's my straight line whatam I going to get it'll be upside downokay now mine's a bit rough buthopefully you'll be able to do yoursnicely just like I illustrated in thekey before right it's actually veryimportant but you put the new upsidedown one in the right spot it wouldn'tbe a reflection if this upside down Iwas like all the way down here okaybecause I wouldn't be reflected acrossthis line right it'd be like if you'restanding right next to a mirror right inits face and then your reflection islike really far awaythat's alright alright are there anyquestions on that that makes senseokay[Music]you always here that's right it'll beeven line will be somewhere else so bythe way before I had to know him blowingquestions right this is a nice easy lineokay um the lines can be hard sometimesfor instance if I drew this heart uphere and maybe you want to try this withme actually if I drew that reflectingline often a we'd angle like this theodds not going to be upside down andit's not going to be back to front wherewill it be oh yeah you're starting tosee see these these translations sorrytransformation don't relate to eachother let me try and do this in a reallyrough way okay there's my perpendicularline I need to go the same distance inthe opposite way okay I'll do it againfor this point yeah does that look sofar so good what at this point somethinglike that yeah okaywhat's another point I should pick so ifI go from here perpendicular so I'mstruggling a little bit I'm trying to beas accurate as I can hmm yeah hold onand have a look we check which otherpoints that connect here versus here itlooks like I'm gonna get a shape likethis I think you're gonna get somethinglike thatnow stop and look at this really carefulhuman because this is really interestingokay as we just said it's not justupside down that's easy quite back tofront either what is that yeah it looksto me like two things that have it looksto me like it's been translated and thenreflected or rotated it's sort of off atan angle isn't it and that's reflectedby the fact this straight line is alltoday okay now that was really rough youcan do a better job when you're actuallydoing it with your ruler you can do someinteresting ones okay
