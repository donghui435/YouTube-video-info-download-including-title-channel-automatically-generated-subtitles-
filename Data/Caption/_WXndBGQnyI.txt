- [Voiceover] What I wanna
do in this video is geta little bit familiar with
the idea of molecular mass.Let's start off with a molecule thatwe're all quite familiar with.In fact, we are made
up of this molecule orto a large degree, made
up of this molecule.That is water and the molecularformula for water is H2O.Every water molecule
has two hydrogen atomsand one oxygen atom.What I'm curious about is, what isthe mass of a molecule of water?So, the way that you might
think about doing that is,what's the mass of each of the hydrogens?You're gonna have two of those and thenwhat's the mass of the oxygen?That would be a reasonable way to do it.So, what is a mass of the hydrogen?A hydrogen has a mass...We can go to a periodic table here,I've got one right over here.You see hydrogen, it has
its atomic number one.That's the number of protons,
that's what makes it hydrogen.Then down here you have this number.I think you can see, it's a
little bit small probably,on your screen, it says, "1.0079".This right over here is the
atomic weight of hydrogen.This is, if you take the
various isotopes of hydrogenon the planet earth and you
take the weighted average.So the ones that are more
common, they are weighted higher.The weighted average
of their atomic massesis 1.0079.Now for the sake of this
first pass, we're just goingto say, "It's roughly one
atomic mass unit." and one wayto think about it...This isn't precise and it's
not how things are defined,but it is a useful way to think aboutatomic mass or mass on the atomic scale.Is that one neutron,or one protonhave an atomic mass of approximatelyone atomic mass unit.In other videos we'll talk
about why it's not definedthis way and why it's based on thecarbon-12 isotope and all of that.But this is a fairly useful
thing that is helpfulto think about, what is the
atomic mass likely to be?What is it roughly?When you see that hydrogen,
it has one proton.Clearly, that's what makes it hydrogen.It also has an atomic mass of
one or roughly one, it says,"Well, it must not have a neutron."That is the case, the most
common isotope of hydrogenon earth is just a proton with a electron.The electron also does contribute to massbut it's negligible
compared to the proton.Most of this mass is
essentially the proton.A little bit of the
electron and also kind ofthe weighted average, when you think aboutthe other isotopes of
hydrogen that maybe mighthave a neutron that is involved with it.For the sake of this, we could say,"Hey, hydrogen, it's a
proton with an electron"kind of buzzing around it."It is approximately oneatomic mass unit,and then oxgen.Oxygen, same idea, we'll
look at the periodic table.You could guess what its mass is close to.Oxygen, the most typical isotope of oxygenthat you'll see on
earth has eight protons.The eight protons are
what makes it oxygen.Any oxygen has to have
eight protons anywherethat you are in the
universe, if it doesn't haveeight protons it's not oxygen.It's gonna have eight
protons and it's gonna haveeight neutrons, that's the
most typical isotope of oxygen.So you might guess that its atomic massis 16 atomic mass units.You can see that your
guess is pretty good.When we look at our atomic
weight right over here.Which is the weighted
average of the variousisotopes of oxygen as found on earth.You get 15.999, which
is pretty close to 16.Our approximation to 16 is pretty good.Then based on these numbersyou would say that this H2Ohas an atomic mass of approximately...Well, two from the hydrogens,
where did I get the two from?Each of these two hydrogenshave an atomic mass of one.If you have two times
one, it's just gonna betwo atomic mass units.Then 16 from the oxygen.Two plus 16,which is going to get us...Let me do this in another
color, since I've been using...It's going to give us 18atomic mass units.Now, if you wanted to be more preciseor if you wanted to say,
"Well, I have this big bag"of water, I'm not looking
exactly at one water molecule."What is going to be, on average,"the mass of those water molecules?"It might be helpful to get
a little it more precise.Then it is helpful, especially
if you're talking about alarge number of molecules
and you really just wannatake the weighted average
of all of those molecules.Then it makes sense to say, "Well, let's"use the atomic weight."So for hydrogen, the atomic weight was1.0079.Which is, once again,
1.0079 atomic mass units.We call it atomic weight
but it's really justthe weighted average, it's not weight inkind of the physics sense
of measuring a force.So, 1.0079 atomic mass
units and the oxygen isis 15.999atomic mass units and if
you wanted to get a moreprecise number here, let's
get a calculator out.I got my calculator.I'm gonna have two times1.0079is equal to, and then to
that I'm gonna add, plus15.999.Gets us to...Let's see, I should go no more thanthree decimal places to the right.Since I added this, if I don't wannaadd precision here...If you wanna a review
of that, you should lookat the video on significant figures.Since I added something
with just three decimals toto the right I shouldn't
have more than three decimalsin my answer so, 18.01,I'll round in the thousandths place,015.So the real one is 18.015atomic mass units.You could actually consider
this the molecular weight.Because once again, we're
using atomic weights.We're using weighted average
and you could think of,maybe the weighted
average of water moleculeswould be a little bit closer to this.These two numbers are very close.So we might call thismolecular weight.Either way, these ideas
are very closely related.When we're thinking on the atomic scale,when people use the word
weight, they're not usingit like a force like
you use in physics thatyou would measure in newtons or pounds.They are essentially taking aweighted average of masses.So the molecular weight of
water, 18.015 atomic mass units.If you wanted to just kinda
be a little bit loosey goosey,you could say it's roughly
18 atomic mass units.
