if we're asked to graph the line yequals 3x minus 6using the intercept method we start byfinding the x-intercept and y-interceptfor our given line remember from theprevious example that all x-interceptshave a y-coordinate of 0 so to find thex-intercept of our line we simply plug a0 in for y and we have 0 equals 3x minus6 solving for x we add 6 to both sidesand we have 6 equals 3x dividing bothsides by 3/2 equals x so our x interceptis 2 which means that our line crossesthe x axis 2 units to the right of theorigin or at the point 2 0 remember fromthe previous example that all yintercepts have an x-coordinate of 0 soto find the y-intercept for our line wesimply plug a 0 in her ex back in theoriginal equation and we have y equals 3times 0 minus 6 so y equals 0 minus 6 ory equals negative 6 so our y-interceptis negative 6 which means that our linecrosses the y axis down 6 units from theorigin or at the point 0 negative 6 tograph our line we simply gothrough our two points
