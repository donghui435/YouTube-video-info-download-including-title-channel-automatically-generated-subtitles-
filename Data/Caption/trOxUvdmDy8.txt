now you're ready to turn over your pageturn over your page and I'll appreciatethe beauty of the metric system therewheezing now you guys can help me withthis because you already know at least2/3 of the page we're gonna form as thelast third okay so here's what you gotlet's remember that essentially speakingin the metric system even though you cango you can go further into smaller unitsor if you want even if further into okaywe essentially have four main units okayum they're the kilometer the mean optionthe centimeter and the millimeter okaynow what I'm going to do is in onediagram I'm gonna progressively do allthree diagrams that you've got in frontof you okay so in terms of conversionsif you have another color get that oneout so that it's um gonna be clear onyour diagram okay when you move from sayone kilometer right how many meters arethere in a kilometer it's up 1,000 whichis why we use through the prepping kiloit means a thousand right same with akilogram or a kiloliterright so to get for one to a thousand wemultiply by a thousand rightthis unit is really big and this one'smuch smaller so if they're bothequivalent then the numbers over hereI've got a much biggeroh I'm so glad you asked thatokay because this is kind of a big pointand why it's confusing right let's go toa physical example if I say twokilometers right that is equal to 2,000meters okay it's not equal to one mm mmEdith okay and the reason why is thisunit is really big so even when you havea small number of them even becausethey're so large you get a large numberof a smaller unit so that's why it ismultiplication and in fact it'smultiplication all the way going frombeep units to small units okaycan we finish it and then discuss betterthat again so now when we go from metersto centimeters of course it's notmultiplied by thousand its multiplied bya hundred right it's all in terms oftens right and then the last one wickiuphow many millimeters in acetaminophenpretend excellent you can see thisbeautiful step down and it makes senseokay and obviously if we want to go inthe opposite direction we would divideby ten or divide by a hundred or dividedby a thousand okay fantastic now what wetook these units right the wonderfulthing about this is that it movesstraight up to area these are all legsit restricted area so easily rightinstead of having a kilometer you justhave a square kilometer right which iswhy on your diagram your second row youhave squares there right and you've gotsquare meters so I can write me to swearyou've got square centimeters and squaremillimeters but because everything issquared all the units are square whenyou convert between them you also squarethat's right and you should have hadthis diagram when you were talking aboutconverting area right so for example ifI went from square kilometers to squaremeters yeah yep a cosmic and then withthe next one yes correctso that's why I've given you I've givenyou more but I don't have that space soyou can see area in terms of area ifthese units are square then when Iconvert I multiplied by whatever squaredwhatever squared or divided divided by10 squared divided by a hundred squareddivided by a thousand square okay so nowwe're up to where we were yesterdaylooking at volume right so volume is notin two dimensions is it it's in threewhich is why on your next throw down youhave a whole bunch of cute right so hereis a cubic kilometer so this is notgoing to be able to anymore I'm youmight as you can see it's a threeright I've just gotta just might as I goso I've got a three here and that's whyit's cubed a three here and there's mycube and even cubic millimeters whichare tiny tiny little things okay nowjust like we said before because theunits are cute that means our conversionprocess will also be cute okay so if youwere to go from cubic kilometers tocubic meters you'd multiply by athousand cubed which is a really bignumber right depending on what countryyou're in it's either a thousand millionor a billion but I want to get into thatClub discussion I mean multiplying byabout 100 cubed or even look at thisright one cubic centimeter okay justlike we drew in our books right onecubic centimeter is how many cubicmillimeters one cubic centimeter it'sgonna be 10 times 10 times 10 that's athousand ten times on it's a thousandcubic millimeters because keymillimeters are so tiny right and in thesame way you would divide by 10 cubed ordivided by 100 cubed or a thousand cubedif you were doing that conversions theother way
