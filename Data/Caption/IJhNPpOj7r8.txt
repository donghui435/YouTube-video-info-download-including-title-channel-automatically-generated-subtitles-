the circumcenter is it's the point ofconcurrency of the three perpendicularbisectors of the sides of a triangle sowhat we're going to do is we're going todraw the perpendicular bisector of thisside of the triangle this side of thetriangle and this side of the triangleand they're all going to cross at onepoint that's the circumcenter so let mesee if I can walk you through theconstruction we don't have to do allthree if you just do two of the sidesthat'll be enough to find the point ofconcurrency so let me go ahead and showyou so what you want to do here is if Iwant to find the perpendicular bisectorof this side right here you want to openthe compass up more than halfway that'sthe key and what you want to do is youwant to draw an arc below that linesegment okay like that and you want todraw it also above the line segment nowsome students what they'll do is they'lljust draw one continuous arc and that'sfine too so all those we'll go ahead anddo it that way then we're gonna go tothe other endpoint like they're here anddo the same thing okay now you can seethat we've got two points ofintersection here and here and we'regoing to draw a line through those twopoints and that's going to be ourperpendicular bisector of the side ofour triangle now when you draw these Ialways draw them a little bit longerthan I think I need okay so I don't haveto go back and then try to you know makethem longer again so there we go sothere's the perpendicular bisector youcan see that's the right angle and it'sbisecting the side of that triangle okaylet's go ahead and rotate the triangleand let's see if we can find theperpendicular bisector of this side nowso we're gonna do the same process againyou want to make sure you open thecompass up a little bit more than halfway okay half the length of the segmentand we're gonna go ahead and make an arcabove and below that line segment I'mjust gonna make a continuous arc just tokeep it simple for us here like that andyou can see they're crossing at twopoints here and here so now we're goingto go ahead and draw a line segmentthrough those two points and that'sgoing to be our perpendicular bisectorokay so if I draw that in there okay I'mtrying to be accurate here so that'sperpendicular and you can see that it'sbisecting the side so this length is thesame as this length now if you see wherethese two perpendicular bisectors arecrossing they're crossing right hereokay that point right there is thecircumcenter and if we were to draw athird perpendicular bisector with thisthird side over here it would also crossat this pointbut just to keep it simple we just drewtwo so now what you're going to do isyou're going to use your compass andyou're going to measure the distancefrom that point of concurrency thatcircumcenter to one of the vertices ofthe triangle like that and what you'llnotice is is that the distance okay tothat to each of the vertices of thetriangle is going to be the same so ifwe were to draw a circle okay around thetriangle okay what's going to happen isit's just gonna just barely touch okaythe edge of the circle so basicallywhat's happening is the circle iscircumscribed around the triangle thetriangle is inscribed inside of thecircle but the reason they call this thecircumcenter is because if you draw upyou know a line from this point to eachof the vertices of the triangle thoseare all going to be congruent okay sothose are the radii of the circle andthey're going to all be equal to oneanotherso it's a pretty neat construction ifyou take your time and you're reallyaccurate you'll find out that it's goingto you know lie right on the circle andit comes out really neat so again I hopeyou understand how to work withconstructing the circumcenter and basedon this video here we put together andsubscribe to the channel check out moreconstructions on my youtube channelMario's math tutoring and I look forwardto helping in the future videos I'lltalk to you soon
