this video looks of the area theperimeter and the volume of somecircular shapes some of the basic termswe're going to be using here is find thefirst one we're looking at is theradiance the radiance is a distance fromthe center of the circle to the outsideof the circle okay and it doesn't matterwhere you sort of talk about on theoutside a circle reducing some distancefrom the middle to the outside is alwaysthe same the next time one here we'relooking at is a diameter a diameterdescribes a distance across the span ofthe circle and what you probablyrealized is this is the twice thedistance the radius the next I'll beusing is the circumference thecircumference is the same as saying theperimeter of a circle and it's adistance around the outside of a circlefinally we're going to be using thisGreek letter pi is 3.14 day and itssymbol is shown and this constant number3.14 you'll be using a fair bit when wewere working with circlesso first off we'll have a look at thearea okay so the area of the circle isPI R square which means pi times 1/2times R so we'll consider where we havea radius of 5 centimeters substitutingthe value in area equals pi times 5squared which equals 3.14 times 5 times5 which multiply these out gives us ananswer of roughly 78 centimeters squaredI capital of another example in thisexample we have a radius of 11 meters sowe'll substitute in the values so thearea equals pi times 11 times 11this equals straight-4 1/4 times 11times 11 which equals 390 point 1 3liters squaredokay so when working in air is just asimple matter of substituting the radiusinto that formula PI R square next labelis their conference so as you rememberthe circumference is the same the samethe perimeter of a circle it's adistance running outside thecircumference equals 2 PI R once againit's just a matter of substituting inthe values so so the radius is 9centimeters the circumference wouldequal 2 times pi times 9 which equals 2times 3.14 times 9 which when youcalculate it is 56 point five fivecentimeters that was another exampleso in the next example we have adiameter which is 9 centimeters okay sowe have to work out the radius is theradius nearly half a diamond so half of9 is 4.5 centimeters and we justsubstitute in the formula circumferenceis 2 5 pi by 4 point 5 which is 2 times3.14 by 4.5 which gives us an answer oftwenty eight point two eight centimetersand it's the circumference next we'lllook at working at the volume of acylinder when considering the volume ofa cylinder where I'll give you big fancyformula first I'm only asking to you toconsider different parts now the air ofthe circle part of cylinder right we'vealready seen is PI R squaredthe other thing we deal with is theheight so how do we use these two towork out the volume of the cylinder wellthe volume quite simply is the area ofthe certain times the height so youcould work that out in formula veryeasily so the area is PI R squared sothe volume is PI R squared times theheightso let's use this to work out the volumeof a few different cylinders first offwhat's where we're from where we've gota radius and a cylinder of 4 centimetersand a height of 11 centimeters so whatwe'll do is I've shading in a circlepart and leave the other part part blankso so you can separate the two forstudies so PI R squared is 3 point 1 4by 4 by 4 pi still times 11 so a equals50 point 2 7 times 11so times are once again your fivehundred and fifty two point nine twocentimeters squared well with anotherexample here and once again I'll show itagain here we have a diameter of 12meters the height of seven eight metersso the radius is going to be - thediamond which is six meters ofsubstituting Y R squared is 3.14 by sixby six times seven eight working thishalf this equals thirteen ten timesseven eight so the volume of thecylinder is nine and twenty two 165metres - so anyway to sum it all upfirst off the area of a circle is PI Rsquared where pi is 3.14 r is the radiuscircumference of a circle the perimeteris two PI R the volume of the cylinderis basically the area PI R squared timesthe height so if you can work that outit should go well with circular shapestip good luck that by
