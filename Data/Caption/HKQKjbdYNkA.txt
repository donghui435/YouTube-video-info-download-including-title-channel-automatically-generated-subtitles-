hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmammoth comm and this is Maithili mymascot and assistant in this lessonwe're gonna study study temperature andI intend this lesson for about third orfourth grade now we have two scalescommonly used to measure temperaturefirst one being the Celsius scale andthat is used in almost all the world andthe second one being the Fahrenheitscale which is used in the United Statesand for the Celsius scale there are twopoints that define it two temperaturesfirst one being zero degrees Celsiuswhich is when water freezes and then 100degrees Celsius which is when waterboils okay these two points define theCelsius scale and the correspondingpoints in the Fahrenheit scale are 32degrees when water freezes and then 212degrees Fahrenheit when water boils okaylet's look at some examples here mostpeople think that nice weathercomfortable weather and comfortabletemperature is about twenty something inthe Celsius scale and in the Fahrenheitscale it ends up being seventy somethingokay and then beyond that we go to hotweather above thirty degrees thatbetween 30 and 40 is hot weather okay inFahrenheit it is something like 1890even more than hundred degreesFahrenheit is hot weather then below 20we get into like four cool weather andof course below zero we have snow andice winter you know and in theFahrenheit the fall and cool weatherwould be in below 70 like 60 somethingfifty something for is something even3rd is something and then winter weatherif you have snow and ice in the winterit would be below thirty to twentysomething ten something zero evennegative numbers okay and then one morething I want to point out and that isthis temperature year it is the normalbody temperature forhuman beings in census it is 37 degreesCelsius and in Fahrenheit is 98.6degrees Fahrenheit so about that youhave fever let's say 38 degrees or 37point 5 39 40 41 for the two is feverand environment you might have 99degrees 100 100 102 over here this wouldbe fever temperatures now we are goingto study and look in a little bit intointegers into negative numbers usingtemperature and thinking yourtemperature falling and rising and evenfourth graders 3rd graders can easilyunderstand that let's say for examplethat the temperature is 2 degreesCelsius and it is chilly weather okaywhat is it nothing nothing saying hedoesn't mind that that all he has lotsof fur he can keep warmwell it is 2 degrees Celsius and itfalls 3 degrees if it is 2 degrees andit falls 3 degrees it goes just onedegree below zero so we write cos minus1 degree Celsius if the temperature isnot 3 degrees Celsius in it for six weare three we go down three degrees tozero and another three degrees belowzero so we are at minus three degreesCelsius if it is now one degree Celsiusand it falls five first you go down tozero one degree then four degrees moredown or to negative four minus 4 degreesCelsius oh you can just fall on thatscale it doesn't matter let's say wehave negative two degrees Fahrenheit andthe temperature rises two degreesyou are two degrees below zerotemperature rises to so you come with azero zero degrees higher or negativefour degrees Fahrenheit and it risesfive degrees so then you come out ofyour negatives to zero and one more ifyou have one degrees Fahrenheit or youareseven degrees negative seven degreesthat -7 far in height until thetemperature rises 10 degrees so minusseven and seven degrees minus seven andthen seven more will bring you up tozero and then three more about them sothree degrees Fahrenheitthese are integer additions andsubtractions in disguise whenever it isrising its addition falling means it'ssubtraction negative nine degreesCelsius and the temperature falls twodegrees it gets colder again so we havenegative nine at the temperature getscolderso the temperature drops and goes downit goes to negative 11 degrees minus 11degrees or if you have minus fivedegrees now when it falls four degreesit gets colder it gets more negative sowe have minus nine degrees okay andwe're all done
