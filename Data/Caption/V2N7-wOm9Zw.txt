the general formula for conic is likethis you can see it's ax squared plus BXy plus C y squared plus DX plus CY plusF equals zero and what we want to focusin on are the coefficients in front ofthe x squared term and the y squaredterm so that's the a and the C valuehere so if a and C are exactly the sameokay say they're it's 2x squared andthis is 2y squared if they're exactlythe same sign and the same number thenwe know that it's a circle if a is 0 orC is 0 but they're not both 0 then thatmeans it's a parabola so what what Imean by that is that if you have like ay squared term but no x squared term orvice versa so you have an x squared termbut no y squared term then you know it'sa parabola and then if a and C aredifferent numbers but they have the samesign meaning that they're both positiveor they're both negative so you havelike a positive x squared and a positiveY squared or a negative x squared and anegative Y squared but if these numbersare different then it's an ellipse andthen the last one is that if a and C aredifferent signs meaning if this is apositive and this is a negative lookingabout positive x squared and negative Ysquared or vice versa then you know youhave a hyperbola so let's go throughsome examples here and see if you canidentify you know whether it's aparabola lip circle hyperbola et ceterabut before I do that I just want tomention that if you're preparing for theAC T or the SAT check out my huge AC Tmath review video course or my huge SATmath review video course those areavailable for sale through the linkbelow or on my website or on the aboutpage on my youtube channel so if you'repreparing close tests and you want to goover some concepts and look at teachingand examples and prepare yourself betterfor scoring high on that test definitelycheck out those video courses but let'sgo through these examples here so we'vegot the first one 3x squared minus 4ysquared plus 6x minus 8y plus 10 equals0 ok so what we want to zero in on is wewant to zero in on the coefficient infront of the x squared term and thecoefficient in front of the Y squaredterm you can see that there aredifferent numbers and there are alsodifferent signs this is positive this isnegative so when they're different signsa and C okay the coefficients in frontof x squared + y squared we know that wehave a hyperso this one right here will just writeh4 hyperbola okay the next one we've gotfive x squared plus 5y squared so on andso forth but again we're trying to zeroin on that coefficient in front of the xsquared term and the y squared term hereyou can see that there are exactly thesame sign they're exactly the samenumber you can see a is equal to C so weknow it's a circle okay in the next onewe'll put C for circle for this one forthe next one you can see the coefficientin front of the x squared term is onethe coefficient in front of the ysquared term is positive two you can seethat they have the same sign meaningthat they're both positive okay butthey're different numbers so that meansthat it's an ellipse okay if they werethe same sign and the same number thenwe'd have a circle like we had the onejust above it so this one's an ellipseokay and then this one letter D you cansee that we have a coefficient in frontof our x squared term there's not a ysquared term so that tells us that thisis a parabola okay and then the last onewe've got three y squared plus y plusfour X minus seven you can see there'snot an x squared term here just a ysquared term so again we have anotherparabola so this is a quick way to justidentify when you're given this in thegeneral form like this whether you havea circle ellipse hyperbola parabolacheck out some of the other videos thatI did talking about how to write thesein the standard form of a circle orellipse or hyperbola parabola I havethose videos on my youtube channelMario's math tutoring subscribe to thechannel check out more math tutoringvideos over there and I look forward tohelping you in the future videos I'lltalk to you soon
