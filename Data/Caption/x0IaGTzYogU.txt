so here we have matrix a and we want toadd it together with matrix B and noticehow matrix a is a 2 by 2 matrix andmatrix B is a 2 by 2 matrix so bothmatrices have the same dimensions so wecan definitely add them together and theonly thing that we need to do whenadding matrices a and B together is weneed to add the corresponding numbers sowhat does that meanwe'll start with matrix a and we'llstart with the number in Row one incolumn one that would be the numberseven and we need to add that with thenumber in Row one in column one in thematrix Band since both numbers are in Row 1 andcolumn 1 after we add them together theywill also be in Row 1 and column 1so now let's do the same thing with thenumbers that are in Row 1 and column 2that would be the number negative 1 inmatrix a and that would be the number 5in matrix B and since they are both inRow 1 and column 2 when we add themtogether they are also going to be inRow 1 and column 2 so now I'm going todo the same thing with the numbers inRow 2 in column 1 in matrix a that wouldbe the number 5 and in matrix B thatwould be the number 4 I'm going to add 5and 4 together and since they are bothin the position Row 2 and column 1 afterwe add them together they are also inthe position Row 2 column 1 and finallywe'll do the same thing for the numbersin Row 2 in column 2 we have a negative4 and a 3 so I'm going to add these twonumbers and also keep it in the positionRow 2 and column 2 so I think many ofyou get the idea and see how easy it isby now the only thing that we need to dois just add the numbers together in ourRow 1 column 1 position we have thenumber 7 plus 2 which is just 9 in ourRow 2 column 1 position we have 5 plus 4which is also 9 in our Row 1 column 2position we have negative 1 plus 5 whichis 4 and in our Row 2 and column 2position we have negative 4 plus 3 whichis negative 1 so this is our resultingmatrix when we add a plus B
