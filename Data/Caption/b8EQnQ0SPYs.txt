Hello!I'm going to go a bit "Blue Peter" on you today,and show you how to make thispop-up dodecahedron.Let me show you that again.Pop, like that.Now, the dodecahedron is a Platonic solidand it's so cool, because it has twelve facesand each face is a regular pentagon.Now, the regular pentagon is a shapeof five sides of equal length,with internal angles of 108бу.First of all, we need to make this.Now, I'm going to show you an easy way to make a regular pentagon.All you do is take a strip of paper, like this,and you tie a loose knot in it,and gently pull that tighter.If you do that, you will get a perfect regular pentagon.Cut off these edges hereand you'll get something like this.Now, to make the dodecahedron, you'll need some stiffish card.I find that Amazon will send youan ample supply of free cardboardwith each purchase,which is kind of them.So take your cardand your pentagon,and trace the pentagon onto the cardand trace another pentagon adjacent to each sideso it looks something like this.You'll get six pentagonsand it kind of looks like a flower.Cut that out and score it,and if you do that,you'll get something like this.Now this is half of your dodecahedron,so you'll need two of them,like that.Now put them together, and then turn themjust a turn out of sync, like that.If you do that,and take an elastic band,I want you to weave the elastic bandover the top layerand under the bottom layer,over the top layer, and under the bottom layer,all the way aroundand when you've gone all the way around--pop!And that's how you do it.
