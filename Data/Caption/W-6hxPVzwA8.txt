welcome here's a cute puzzle tenstudents stood in the circle here theyare as green dots and their ages had theamazing property at the age of any oneperson the circle turns out to be theperfect average of the ages of her twoimmediate neighbors I tell you Betty isin the circle and she's 15 years old thequestion is how old is Jake Jake is alsoin the circle by the way all right sothat's the puzzle I don't let you thinkabout that because I'm better to giveread the answer you might want to pauseso think about that see if you noticeeven ask the question I mean you coulddo some meta or reasoning I guess youhave two students we don't know whereJake is it's gonna be independent wherehe sits in the circle and since 15's theonly number mentioned Jake's probablygoing to be 15 so that guess the realpuzzle is given that sort of analysiswhy would everyone in that circle haveto have the same age of 15 same age asBetty if their average is a if each ageis the average of the two neighbors allright so maybe pause think about thatbecause here comes the answer all rightlet's think about so Betty as a neighborhears a neighbor Josephine if a Josephif Josephine is older or younger than usis gonna be the same I'll just go withold or say makes you seventeen and ahalfthat means seventeen and a half is theaverage of a smaller number than it andsomething else which means the herneighbor has to be a bigger age and allof a 17 have to be the average ofsomething smaller than it has to bebounce for something bigger than it soit means as I go around from JosephineI've gone up an age I've gone up an ageagain all right now look at look at thisthis person here she's an age that's theaverage of her two neighbors but one ofher neighbors has a smaller age whichmeans her other neighbor better have abigger age so again the age isincreasing as if you're in the circle ifI keep doing this I can argue that eachperson's age is balanced an average bysmaller one and a bigger one so as Iwalk around the circle there the kidsages must be increasing so I have anincreasing sequence of Ages the somehowmagically returns back to being 15 againthat's impossible Josephine can't beolder but the same token she can't beyounger she can't be 14 because 14 to bethe average of two neighbors as theaverage something slightly bigger than14 and something smaller than 14 so Ihave a decreasing Coetzeethat's going around I'd have to argue adecreasing sequence cannot return tobeing 15 again impossible there any wayout of this pickles everyone has thesame age age 15 those that like algebramight want to think about this way let'slet's make this little cleanness a messright now did you do a little bitcleaner as I said he goes alright sothis is 15 so let's call the neighbors15 age 15 plus X X could be a positivenumber could be a negative numbermaybe it's zero maybe can prove it zeroin order for 15 plus X to be the averageof 15 or something else one can checkthis better be 15 plus 2x and actuallymakes sense because if this numbers themiddle two other numbers that's X unitsdown there better be X units up whichmeans you can check the next age has tobe 15 plus 3x in order for this to bethe average of something it's X downthis number better be x up and so onthis must be 15 plus 4x all the wayaround all the way around go all the wayaround back to here which must be 15plus 10x but the only way 15 plus 10 Xto equal is to equal 15 is of X is thezero and if one has the same age allright so this is all the more algebraicway of doing it but if you just littleuse your reasoning about ages are theincreasing or decreasing it follows thatway as well for the third puzzle I'mabout to give I'll give you a second oneat the moment but the third one maybethe algebraic approach is the best wayto go because about to add a couple oftwists so that's just what I wanted tomention it now all right so let's let meclear the screenand let's let's play with a couple ofvariations suppose instead of everyonebeing the same age as our two immediateneighbors suppose the ages of these kidshas the property the age of any onestudent is the average of the two peopletwo places away that is Betty's age isthe average of her neighbors two placesto the left and the person two pages tothe right this person's age is theaverage of two places to the left twoplaces to the right whoops this is not aplace of the right sitting me two placesthe right and you know this person's ageis the average of two places to the leftand two places to the right well now ifI tell you again that Betty is 15 mustJake be 15 as well in that situationeveryone has age average of twoneighbors to the left and rightall right now what's not too bad I'lllet you think about itbut here's the one that's really juicy areally juicy puzzle suppose I mix up thewhole that the two examples I just gavewhere everyone's like one distance awayinto distance away suppose the kids inthis circle of the property the age ofany one person is the average of theneighbor one place to the left and theneighbor two places to the rightfor example this person's age is the airage of one place to the left and twoplaces to the right and this person'sage is the age of one place to the leftand two places to the right so myquestion is in this scenario if Betty is15 must everyone in that circle again be15 good luck proving that one that one'sgot some meat to it or maybe it's nottrue maybe finding a counterexample isactually possible which has meat to itas wellall right have fun thanks very much
