to find the union of two sets so Unionright means to kind of combine bringtogether so remember that the Unionlet's call this set a and let's callthis set B so a union B means that allelements X ax represents all the membersare the elements such that ax iscontained in the egg or ax is containedin to be now remember or is going to beinclusive that means it can be in hey itcan be in feed or it can be in both ofthem so we need to look at this look atwhich members of elements are containedin either one of these or both so wenotice that there's no members that theyshare they all actually they both sharenine right so you sense - in both ofthem it is included I do not need towrite it twice so a union B the union ofmy two sets a B is going to be I'm justgoing to order them from least togreatest two three foursix eight nine now don't you direct ninetwice because it's just saying listingthe elements okay so we're just listingwhat elements are in either one of themare both so I don't need to recognizetwice and all okay so that is the unionof those two sets what you notice iswhen I did the union of those two sets Ipretty much took all the elements of atook all the elements of B and broughtit together and that's how you find youdo you in two sets
