Find the domain
of f of x is equalto the principal square
root of 2x minus 8.So the domain of
a function is justthe set of all of the possible
valid inputs into the function,or all of the possible
values for whichthe function is defined.And when we look at how the
function is defined, rightover here, as the square root,
the principal square root of 2xminus 8, it's only
going to be definedwhen it's taking the
principal square rootof a non-negative number.And so 2x minus
8, it's only goingto be defined when 2x minus 8
is greater than or equal to 0.It can be 0, because then you
just take the square root of 0is 0.It can be positive.But if this was negative,
then all of a sudden,this principle square root
function, which we're assumingis just the plain vanilla
one for real numbers,it would not be defined.So this function definition is
only defined when 2x minus 8is greater than or equal to 0.And then we could
say if 2x minus 8has to be greater
than or equal to 0,we can solve this
inequality to seewhat it's saying about
what x has to be.So if we add 8 to both
sides of this inequality,you get-- so let me just
add 8 to both sides.These 8's cancel out.You get 2x is greater
than or equal to 8.0 plus 8 is 8.And then you divide
both sides by 2.Since 2 is a
positive number, youdon't have to swap
the inequality.So you divide both sides by 2.And you get x needs to be
greater than or equal to 4.So the domain here is the
set of all real numbers thatare greater than
or equal to 4. xhas to be greater
than or equal to 4.Or another way of saying
it is this functionis defined when x is
greater than or equal to 4.And we're done.
