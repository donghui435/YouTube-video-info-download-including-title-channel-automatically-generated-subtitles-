welcome in this video let me address thequestion why is it zero factorial equalto one the reason actually is not quitethe mathematical reason though it'sthere to actually make the mathematicseasier but before I begin into that letme first accussed what effect Orioles inthe first place they arise from acertain time a problem hey guys my nameis Jim and suppose I just asked how manyways can I rearrange the letters of theword Jim well I could sit there and andjust write out all six ways let's takevery long but let me see if anybody's insystematic way systematic way first ofall there are three slots for the eachof the letters so we got the firstletter a second letter and a thirdletter well there are three choices forwhat that first oqb can either be a Jcould either being I will get either BMso I have three options and what toplace in the first slot once I've made achoice maybe it's J I'd have two optionson what the second that could be in thiscase could be eye on em or if I'd choseneither BJ or M if I chose the M iteither be J or I so either way whateverI've done in the first spot the twochoices what took place in the secondslot now once I've made a choice for thefirst and second slots I'm afraidthere's only one option left walkingdrawing the third slot in each case if Ichose a J than an eye I must put an Mnext or chose the J or the MS put an AInext or in this case if I must put an Mhere or J in fact for each possibilitythere's only one option left over ineach case so once I've got chosen thefirst slot and second slot there's onlyone choice from third slot but we seenow there are actually six options ourtotal here's one way to arrange Jim doesit keep this Jim there's another waymiji or could be image and so on so thechildren always has three choices timesof two choices for each of those threetimes one option of each of those thatgives me three times two times one whichis six ways to raise that as Jim andthis quantity three times two times onethis type of quantity comes up a lot inmathematics we give it a special namethree factorial so if example fivefactorial would be other ways to arrangethe layers of my name James which that'sthe more formal way of my nameproviding my name there'll be fiveoptions for the first slot transforms tothe second three two one the tens of 120and it's 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times1if there we had hours of fun playingwhat's the different ways to arrangepeople the lives of people's namesexcept they could be a difficulty so yougo so let me start exploring some somecurious words such as the word cheesesuppose I wanted to rearrange theletters of the word g CH e e s ii andright away we see there's a problem ifthese E's were different if this was a 1e 2 e 3 then the odds would be exactlyhad before there are 5 slots 3 5 choiceswhat to put in the first either C or anH maybe 2 e 2 maybe III there must havemade a choice to four options for thenext slot it has three options the nextslot two options one option so theanswer would be five fact or andenormous circumstances and if I reallyhit the patience I can go ahead and listall 120 ways to do it and let me justpretend I'm going to really bore you anddo it here's one way it could be C thenit could be a one that could be e 2 thenit could be a 3 then it could be the sand they could be an H that's one way orit could be seen that could be 1 or e 3E 2 sh or could be C e 2 e 3 oopsII won SH what could be C e 2 e 1 e 3 Shwhat could we see III e 1 e 2 Sh okay Igot a real put under here C III e 2 e 1Sh at 6 ways or it could be a 1c e 2 H sIII or could be a 1c e 3 HS e 2 and soon and so on and so on so if there if Ikeep the east distinguishable by pinionslittle subscripts you want to e 2 e 3 Idon't say there's going to be 120 waysto answer this problem but what happensif I delete these subscripts and makethe ears indistinguishable well thenactually these six answers here wouldcollapse into one possible answer C andE e e isH these six answers here if I kept goingwhich collapsed one answer ec e H s EEin fact all groups of six coming fromthe six ways to arrange the EES amongstthemselves would collapse to be oneanswer for the case when the earsindistinguishable so I have to take thisanswer and divide by six so I can seeactually there are five factorialdivided by well three factorial the waysto arrange III e 2 e 1 ways to raiseletters the word cheese if I make this alittle more complicated let's look atthe word cheese's which case I canrepeat ease and repeat messes and let mejust get my pen going again see h e s es normally if I could tell them apart a1 e 2 e 3 and E s 1 and s 2 they'll giveme 6 factorial ways to arrange theletters cheese's however if I remove thesubscripts to the YZ those answers wouldcollapse all the ways that rearrange theease of mice and stalls would collapseinto one answer well there are threefactorial ways to arrange 3 YZ in miceitself so this adds to a 6 factorial forJesus would collapse by 3 factorialhowever these s's are stilldistinguishable if I were to also removethe subscripts from the aesir's all theanswers here would collapse further infact you know if one arts was s1 HC e ee s2 and another ax was s2 HC e e es1those two would collapse to single outso if I move the subscripts to s HC e--y e s so at least divide this byanother 2 factorial well that's the sameas putting another to factor all and thedenominator divided by 2 factorial as anextra 2 factor on the bottom so there wegoI have 6 factorial 3 factorial 2factorial over 2 factorial H lettersgeezers let's get a little crazier let'stake a very complicated world let's pickchoose my favorite non word of all G's zgz sthis nurse the quality of being thecheesiest cheese of all cheesiest Dismasokay my handwriting is atrocious herelet's see this Hemi that has one twothree four five six seven eight nine teneleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteensixteen so under normal circumstances ifI could tell that as apart there'd be 16factorial ways to rearrange thoseletters 16 and 15 times 14 under 13 allthe way down 2 times 2 times what a hugenumberhowever I've got some repeats ii ii iiii and ii there are five ease in thereif I remove the distinguishing labelsthe ease that collapses 5 factorialgroups of answers into one answer butalso repeat answers there's an S here shere s here s here s here and s herethat 6s is if I remove subscripts fromthose s's answers will collapse myfactors a six factorial I've also gotsome other repeat letters have I notwell no no that's it but if I wanted toI could save it as one C and divide theanswer by 1 factorial that's assuming Ihave meaning to the notion 1 factorialwell I do I can make sense of that if nfactorial is all the numbers n times nminus 1 down 2 times 3 times 2 times 1the product all the numbers from 1 up ton then 1 factorial I guess would just bethe products all numbers from 1 up to 1would just be 1 so divided by 1factorial for the see it's actually fineit keeps my how to correct that there'sone H so I could also divide by 1factorial for the H and there's 1 T 1factorial for the T and 1 N 1 factorialfor the N let's see is 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 34 5 I'm missing oh there's an eyethere's an eye new as missing a letter 1factorial for the eye in fact I'd likedoing this because this little selfcheck the numerator represents 16letters in all 5 over 2 is 6 3 s's 1 C 1H 1 I 1 T 1 n in fact I can see thosenumbers there out to 16 I've got themall so the ways to range number ways toarrange the letters of the wordcheesiest isness is 16 factorial dividedbyfactorial six factorial 1 factorial 1 42 1 4 2 1 4 2 1 4 2 I know this seemssilly putting 1 factorial is very wellit's just 1 the volume of one doesnothing for you but at least it makesthe mathematics consistent and clear infact let me go a little bit further howmany peas do you see in the wordcheesiest isness none I see zero peas soI should divide all so then if I'm goingto count with the business way by 0factorial and hand accused you see noneso for no queues at 0 factorial therealso no B's and there's also no ends sonot being very silly but if I want thisformula still be correct what should idefine 0 factor oughta be so mymathematics is dual fine well clearly Iwant 0 factorial to be 1 it doesn't makesense in terms of the definitionfactorial multiplied order together allthe numbers from 1 up to 0 no meaninghowever if I choose and this is a choiceto just be convenient and define 0factorial to be 1 then this formula isstill correct invalid in factmathematicians choose to make thischoice they will set 0 factorial equalto 1 so that in any formula right downfor problems that involve arrangingletters and counting way to arrangeletters and so forth is correct if itturns out there's still no letters ofthat particular type in the formula it'sjust a matter of convenience it'd beirritating to have to write in a paperhere's the form for the number of waysto rearrange this unless known to be 0of these things which case the formulaappears as follows or there had to be 0of these things in the case the formulaappears as follows and so on just toavoid a lot of writing mathematiciansfind it aptly convenient or anyconvenient matter of convenience themath isn't telling me to do this in anydeep way to set 0 factorial to 1 becauseif I do that then I could say the numberof ways to arrange the letters of myname gym would be 3 factorial over 1factorial 1 factorial 1 factorial 1 forJ 1 for I 1 for M that's correctand also zero factorial on the bottombecause there's no T's in my name that'sit that's why 0 factorial is set equalto 1 nothing deep just a matter ofconvenience
