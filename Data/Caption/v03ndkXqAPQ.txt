okay so in this story for subtractionof the opposite which puts me in a bitof adocument for example we're clearly inthe story talking about dots so if I'mgoing to take a subtraction as theaddition of the opposite that means Ineed the notion of the opposite of a dotwhich gives me two problemswhat would I draw for the opposite of adot and what should I call the oppositeof a dot all right so a lot of thinkinghere but maybe in fact most people tendto go with me on this but maybe a goodsymbol for the opposite of a dot wouldbe just an open circle this time nowwhat to call it people come up with allsorts of names when I talk to you aboutthis one common name is anti dot becauseI should personally like that onebecause that makes me think of sciencefiction because we've taken a lump ofmatter and a love of antimatter togetherapparently the dream of dreams closearound at hand and they go poof theyjust annihilateso in some sense that would be theopposite of this some people like thename Todd can you guess where that'scoming fromI like that one sure I think it's reallyclever all right but I'll go with antidots here I see you've got dots and antidots and the idea is like matter andantimatter you put them together sohere's a dot and an edge with an antidot they go poof they just annihilateand give you this picture of nothing sohow do I draw a picture of nothing theywill just do this like littleannihilation occurred all right sothat's it now the notion of dots andanti dots and even right now withoutdots and boxes I can actually dosomething rithmetic with these sorts ofthings for example if I take five dotsand add to that pile saves three antidots what I'm really doing right now isdoing five plus the opposite of threewhich I might write as well - three asmost people do and we'll see someannihilations will occur push push pushsmudgy and one by left with two actualdots most people call the subtractionthey might say five take away three Ilike to think of five plus the oppositeof three same ideas all good stuff inthe end leaves the same app asses orgrant what I like about this if I saythree dots and this time for anti dotsso now I'm doing why am i doing threeplus the opposite of four or clearlysome annihilations put push and push I'mleft with one anti dot so even right nowwith an ocean of dots and any dots I cando some basic arithmetic so ourchallenge now is to dosort of brittle tick in the dots andboxes set up so it's have someexplosions going on cool stuff all righthere goes
