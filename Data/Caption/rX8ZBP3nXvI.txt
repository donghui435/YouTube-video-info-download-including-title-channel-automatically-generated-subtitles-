one pipe can fill a pool one and a halftimes or 1.5 times faster than a secondpipe if both pipes are open the pool canbe filled in six hoursif only the slower pipe is open how longwould it take to fill the pool so any ofthese things where you have one or morethings that are trying to do some typeof work and not work in the physicssense but in kind of the everyday sensethey're trying to do a job the pipes aretrying to fill the pool the importantthing to think about is it in terms ofthe rate in which the P the pipes canfill the pool or the guys can mow thelawn or whatever it might be so let'sthink about the two pipes and once youhave the rates you can then add therates together so the slower pipe theslower let me do that in yellow so theslower pipe slower the slower pipewhat's the rate at which it can fill apool well they don't tell us much aboutit so let's just say that it it can filla pool in T hours or if you wanted tolook the rate at which it could fill thepool it can do one pool one pool in onepool in T and T hours and I wanted towrite its rate in terms of T becausethat's what we're trying to solve for atthe end how long would it take to fill apool it takes it T hours it can do onepool in T hours this is a rate over herethis is the rate at which the slowerpipe can fill a pool now what about thefaster pipe what about the faster pipethe faster faster pipe well it tells usone pipe can fill a pool one and a halftimes faster than a second pipe so thefaster pipe can fill a pool one and ahalf times faster than a slower pipe soif this can do one pool in T hours thefaster pool the faster pipe can do onepoint five times that it can do onepoint five pools one point five pools inin T hours right in the same amount ofhours it can do one and a half times asmuch work or one and a half times asmuch of a job it can fill one and a halfpools so how much can they do togetherwell together let me writein orange so let's think about ittogether two togetherwhat could they do well this if youlet's just imagine that they're workingtogether forty hours so this can fillone pool in T hours and this can fillone and a half pools in T hours you canadd these two things so you get sotogether they can do one over T 1 over Tpools per hour pools per hour or one orpool per hours sometimes the plural andsingular gets a little bit messed uphere but hopefully you get the idea plusone and a half one and a half over Tpools per hour so together if you addthese two things they're going to beable to do if you can imagine this guycan do one pool in two hours this guycan do one and a half pools in T hourstogether they're going to be able to ifyou if you let T hours go by togetherthey're going to be able to do two and ahalf pools two and a half pools two anda half pools in T hours in T hours andnotice the units are the same and you'rereally just adding 1 over T plus 1 and1/2 over T you have the same denominatorso you can just add the numerators 1plus 1 and half cos 2 and 1/2 and it'svery very very important whenever you'redoing these rate problems is to alwaysmake sure that it's making sense ok yeahthey can do more pools in the sameamount of time we've added the two and Isay that because sometimes when you dothis you're tempted to do the inverse ofthese you're tempted to say hours perpool hours per pool and then when youadd them you will actually get morehours per pool which is not intuitiveeven because if you have two thingsworking together it shouldn't take morehours per pool it should you shouldbeget more pools per hour and so that'sa really important reality checkwhenever you're doing one of these rateproblems so anyway if they're workingtogether they can do 2.5 pools in Thours and remember the T was just howlong the slower pipe takes to fill onepool but they also tell us so this istheir rate this is their rate this istheir rate at which they can fill poolsand then they tell us that at that ratethe combined rate together if they iftheywork for six hours if they do if theywork for six hours then they can fill apool so you have the rate if youmultiply it by the time if you multiplyit by six hours you should get theamount of work they've done and onceagain this is not work in the physicssense this is work in the everyday sensethey've the work of filling a pool so ifyou get it you get the amount of workwork and I really want to emphasize thisis the non physics if you don't know thephysics definition of work don't worryabout it too much but I don't wantanyone who does know it getting confusedthis is really just I guess how much ofa job they can do and so they were ableto fill one pool and the unit's I thinkare really convenient here because itreally makes sure you're gettingeverything straightso two-and-a-half pools per hour or twoand a half over T pools per hour timessix hours gives us one pool they give usthe six hours right over there that'show long it takes to fill one pool andso now we can solve for T if we divideboth sides if we divide both sides bywell we can divide both sides by sixhours we can divide both sides by sixhours six hours we get on the left-handside this cancels out you get 2.5 over Tpool pulls per hours I guess we couldsay or pools per hour is one way tothink about it is equal to 1/6 or oneover six pools per hour and I know I'madding s s and taking it off s is herethat's where the unit's start to breakdown a little bit but I think you seewhat I'm doing I'm just making it sounda little bit better in English and soyou have the same units on both sides sotwo-and-a-half over T must be equal to1/6 so let me write it over here so 2.5over T must be equal to 1/6 must beequal I wouldn't do that in that greencolor must be equal to 1 over 6 and sowe can multiply we can multiply bothsides by T and multiply both sides by 6to get rid of the denominators there sowe're going to multiply both sides bysix and multiply both sides by T bothsides by T and both sides by six 6cancels with six on the right hand sidewe are just left with a T T times 1 onthe left hand side this T cancels withthis T 6 times 2 and 1/2 6 times 2 is 126 times 1/2 is 3 so 12 plus 3 is 15 so Tis equal to 15 so if you go back overhere you get 15 for this so the slowerpipe can fill one pool in 15 hours onepool and 15 hours so that answers ourquestion if the slower pipe is open howlong would it take to fill the pool itcan fill one pool in 15 hours so theanswer is 15 15 hours and we are done
