let's play a very simple game Zen andZara will tell us how they've beenworking hard on constructing triangleswe just have to find out if they'retelling the truthfirst let's hear Zen out he tells usthat he constructed a triangle in whichthe lengths of the sides were twocentimeters three centimeters and fivecentimeters is then telling us the truthlet's find out we should use thetriangle inequality theorem to find thisout the sum of any two sides should begreater than the third side so wecalculate the sum of any two sides andverify if it's greater than the thirdside let's find out the sum of the firsttwo sides it's two plus three what isthe third side it is five and we knowthat two plus three is equal to five butthe sum of two sides has to be greaterthan the third side it means that atriangle with sides two three and fivecentimeterscannot be formed then was lyingnow Zara wants to tell us about thetriangle she constructed she tells usthat the length of the sides of thattriangle are three four and fivecentimeters is there idling the truthlet's make a small table to note the sumof two sides and the third side rememberbased on the theorem we learnt the sumof any two sides should be greater thanthe third side the sum of first twosides is three plus four and the thirdside is 5/3 plus four is greater thanfive can we conclude that Zara istelling us the truth not yet we havejust looked at one of the cases now letus consider the next combination fourplus five the other side is three andthe sum which equals nine is greaterthan three now for the last combinationwhich is three plus five the remainingside is four and three plus five isgreater than four so we can see that thecondition is satisfied for all threecases it means that a triangle withsides three four and five centimeterscan be formed Zara was indeed telling usthe truth
