multiplying fractions is actually reallyeasy sort of it's only easy for two ofthe three kinds of fractions right justleave it there that's finewhat are the three kinds of fractionsremember what they are ya knowmix the rules that's the first onesomething you someone give me anotheroneyeah and obviously because these areimproper the last one is for what properfractions good now for two of themnamely this one and this onemultiplication of fractions is supereasy in fact it's probably easier thanadding them okay but what we've got overhere is mixed numeralsnow being this is harder and I'll showyou why in a second the strategy we'regoing to take is we're going to turnthis into one of these and then it'ssimple okay so watch with me first whatI'm gonna do is show you a common way toapproach this which isn't right but it'sjust as important to look at ways not todo something then to know the ways to doit okay because then you know what toavoid and common mistakes a lot ofpeople make them so we want to watch outfor them now one of the ways I've seen alot of you do is say well I've got thistime this right I don't really know howto do that so I'll separate them outI'll do the whole numbers firstI'll go 1 times 1 and that's 1 and thenI've got a half and I've so all gone 1/2times 1/2 and because that's a properfraction it's easy to multiply 1/2 of1/2 is 1/4 so you're like I've got 1times 1 here I've got 1/2 times 1/2 hereI should put them together and you get 1plus 1/4that's one inner corner ok now youshould be suspicious of this right thisis not the right way to go though itdoes seem like it makes sense the wayyou can know even before knowing what isthe right way to do it the way you canknow this is actually not right isbecause if you multiply something by oneand a half rightlike say 10 times 1 and 1/2 does thenumber 10 does it get biggerwhat does it get smallerit gets bigger it'll get 50% bigger onecup okay but what in a quarter issmaller than what we started with it'ssmaller than both of these right so oneof the quarter can't possibly be theright answer so therefore how do we doitokay well what I'm going to do as I saidbefore I'm gonna convert I want to gofor a mix numeral into any improperfraction and then I can just multiplyacross let's watch one and a half it'snice that they gives the same numberbecause once we do one we've got both ofthemwhat's one and a half as an improperfraction you know meand the way you can see that right is ifI slip this back up into a 2 and a 1/2plus 1 over 2 you have 2 over 2 is yourone out the front and your 1 over 2stopsvigo 3 over 2 and it's the same fractionagain ok so now that the improperfraction it's really easylet me just rather put down the air soI'll show you what's the what's going onin my headI want to multiply the numerators andmultiply the denominators they turn intoone fraction ok 3 times 3 of course is 9and 2 times 2 is 4 now that is thecorrect answer but being that they gaveit twisters of mixed new rule we shouldprobably give it back as a mixture ruleas well so some of you will be able toconvert this directly to be 0 just rightfor those of you who maybe you can't seeit straight away what intermediate linecould I put in here to help you work outwhat makes nehru its equivalent to whatkind do oh yeah good you do 9 divided by4 right you get how many foursfit into 9 - so I'm gonna get a 2 outthe front okay but there's a remainderisn't it what's left over there's 1because 2 times 4 is 8 right so thatremainder of 1 becomes the front therethey go yeahoh my CT self is happy now okay greatbig guy so that's finethat's why you do it some of you as wellmight write it like this eight plus oneover four because eight plus one is nineeight and a forest - it's exactly thesame thing okay but the important thingis you just show this working I know youwant to go straight from here to here oreven not even write this down just writedown the answer the problem with that isare both in your own work and an exam isif something goes wrong something uphere gets confused and you get thiswrong if none of this is shown if all Isee is just that right then I don't knowwhere it's come from I don't know if youjust guessed I don't know if you reallyunderstand what's going on okay whereasyou can see what's happening and howI've got me itself okay does any want toclarify anything that's on the boardthere that makes senseI'm gonna do the next one you're gonnatell me what to do though okay so let'sdo the next one which is Hwhat am I gonna do first I need to do aconversion right yeah baby good okay solet's do the tutor elated you reckon youcan convert that into any properfraction for me well done okay so if youdidn't see that straightaway the 16comes from 7 times 2 which is 14 plus 2so it sort of goes around if youremember me doing that diagram right so6 have it good 3 and 1/2 fractured whocould do it yeah don't go now this is agood example to follow up with becausewe could multiply across but you've seenbefore we want to avoid big numbersright so rather than to 16 times 7 and 7times 2 I'm going to notice I can cancelright if there's a 7 on the top and a 7on the bottom I can get rid of both ofthem right this guy and this guy theywill vanish so that's going to be 16 on2 which of course is there you go andyou don't need to do any moreconversions that's it ok
