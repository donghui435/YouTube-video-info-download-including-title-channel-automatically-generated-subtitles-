hello I'm Jason welcome to the linearalgebra tutor here we're going to studysomething called in tuples and alsomatrix arithmetic mostly matrix additionis what we're going to talk about so Iwant to introduce the topic of ann-tuple early on because it's a verysimple concept but usually students willread about it in what does this meanit's a big fancy word I don't understandyou know just like within any class youtake whether it's statistics or calculusor linear algebra the definitions ofvery simple things can sometimes get inthe way so let's tackle this one earlyon let's talk about an in tuple beforewe get to that though let's recall fromyour algebra or for your geometry fromyour geometry you know you've worked alot with XY pairsyou know we plot them on a coordinateaxes X comma Y right so for instance youcan have an ordered pair called 1 comma3 right and this is two numbers so theordered pair 1 comma 3 we know that it'simplied that it means X is equal to 1 Yis equal to 3 the comma serves toseparate those two numbers so that weknow that they're separate so it's not13 it's 1 and it's 3 the one that goeswith X the 3 goes with y I know this ispretty basic stuff but I'm leading tosomething now in three-dimensional spaceyou have x y and z right so I can have apoint that would be 2 comma 4 commanegative 3 so we know because the commasthat the number 2 goes with X the number4 goes with Y and the number negative 3goes with Z and so if I have a threedimensional system I can go XYZ and Ican find that point in three-dimensionalspace and because it's three dimensionalspace we know this is three numbers allright three numbers now why am I goingwith thisa set of in numbers see here I'vealready given you two examples righthere's two numbers and here's threenumbers I'm going to generalize and saywe have n numbers however many numberswe have separated by comma right iscalledand you guessed it in tuple right intopool the word tuple just to put put yournext question to rest means ordered listordered list so now it makes total senseit's very very simple for you tounderstand even though that at firstthis term in tuple seems verycomplicated it just means ordered listof numbers the reason there's an N infront is because frequently in linearalgebra we're gonna be talking aboutsometimes we'll have pairs of twonumbers so here in this case this is anN tuple but two is equal to n so it'salmost like a 2-tuple right sometimeswe'll have three numbers strung togetherwhere we're dealing in three-dimensional
