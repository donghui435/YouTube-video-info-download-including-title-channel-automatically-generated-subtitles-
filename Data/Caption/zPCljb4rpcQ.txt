do you feel like siphoning all the gasfrom every car van trunk and gas stationin your neighborhood and setting yourmath textbook on fire wonderful we canhelp you avoid 25 to life in prison bywatching this video by Fort Bendtutoring and mr. wit hello ladies andgentlemen this is mr. wit wood FortBenton tutoring in today's tutorial isgoing to be over finding the area of asector alright of a circle mm-hmmso here check it out check it out checkit out we have the area of a sector anddefining this ladies and gentlemen wehave a diagram to help us with that wehave the radius okay we know that's fromthe center of the circle to a point onthe circle and this green area here isgoing to be the sector and the area ofthis sector is what we're trying to findthat green shaded area given the factthat our angle theta can be given indegrees or in radians and this L alrightthat LLL which is normally an S is givenas the arc lengthall right the length from that point onthe circle all the way to that point onthe circle okay but what we're findingin this video is the area within thatregion there that slice of the pie theactual pie slice area is what we'retrying to find you got it so here I havea couple of formulas that we'll be usingin today's tutorial one is going to bethe area can be found by taking half ofthe radius squared times theta mm-hmm aslong as theta is in radians okay andyou'll know that it's in radians becauseit will not have a degree symbol that'show you knowall right you see a degree symbol it'sin degrees you don't see a degree symbolit's not in degrees it's in radians thenif they give it to you in degrees and Iknow this is in degrees because I see adegree symbol that if they give you yourcentral angle in degrees you can usethis formula which will be the centralangle in degrees divided by 360 times PIR squared aka the area of a circle allright so here you're just taking a partof the area of a circle so if you'regoing to be in degrees you can stickwith that formula right there or you canactually convert your degrees intoradians and you can check out the linkerright here in order to do that all rightso let's check out some problems inproblem number one we're asked to findthe area of the sector given a radius ofthree meters and theta our anglemeasurement is in radians how do I knowthat because I don't have a degreesymbol so therefore my theta the anglemeasurement in radians is going to be 4PI over 9 so I'll be using my simplifiedformula here the one that I can use whenthe angle measurement is in radianslet's go ahead and fill in some valueshere so starting out I'll have one halftimes a radius of 3 meters that's goingto be squared times theta which in thiscase is going to be 4 PI over 9 allright so this is going to be my initialsetup once I have this ladies andgentlemen I'm going to simplify using myorder of operations so for starters I'llsay that I have the 1/2 times 9 times 4PI over 9 just like that then whathappens from here is that my nines willcancel out all right and also I cansimplify that 2 and the 4 because 2 goesinto itself once and 2 goes into 4 twicemultiplying everything out you'll justend up with the answer that is going tobe 2 pi meters squared all right andthat's going to be in your answerremember when you're dealing with areayour unit of measurement is always goingto be to the second power all rightthat's my answeryeah so if they ask you for an exactanswer meaning that you don't have toactually calculate that value to thenearest thousandth place thenis gonna be it putting a box around myanswer just like that now if you neededyour answer written in decimal notationthen that means that you're most likelygonna be grabbing your calculators soI'm gonna pull out my calculator righthere out of my trusty mmm Fort Bentontutoring calculator case all right andI'll show you what it looks like when weplug in this result here so here you seethat I've gone ahead and plugged in allmy values in the calculator here and allI have to do for me is press Enterso this is gonna give me a result of 6and 283 thousandths if I'm rounding tothe nearest thousandths place and thisis my result done and done ladies andgentlemen all right there you have itokay so our answer rounded to thenearest thousands place is going to besix and 283 thousands all right let's goahead and box that up as wellgift wrapping it done and done that'sproud number one let's move on to ournext one okay we have proper to assessto find the area of the sector this timeour radius is going to be 10 feet andtheta is in degrees that's why we'regonna be using the second form in thiscase once again we have that centralangle in degrees divided by 360 times PIR squared let's plug things in you'llhave your degree measurement which isgoing to be 45 over 360 times pi timesour radius which is 10 and that's goingto be squared then we could go ahead andsimplify this by using the order ofoperations so I'm looking at forty fivePI over 360 times 10 squared is going tobe 100 alright so this is what I havethis far then going forward we're goingto simplify this knowing that 45 we'regoing to itself once 45 goes into 360eight times and then we could reduce thehaydn to 100 by 4 so 4 goes into 8 twiceand 4 goes into 120 five times so thisgives us a result of 25 pi all over 2feet squared all right so that's goingto be your answer as an exact answeronce again if you need to have youranswer in decimal notation then go aheadand plug this inyour calculator and hit enter all rightso here we have our 25 PI over 2 so weend up with 39 and 27 hundredths andthat's rounded to the thousands placeall right let's go ahead and write thatdown okay so we end up with 39 and 27hundredths and that's gonna be a squarefeet all right just like that let's goahead and box of our answers here redbox in it just like this in this isgonna be your results either as an exactanswer or rounded to the nearestthousands place all right there you haveit that's problem number two let's moveon to our next one okay and prod numberthree it says to find the area of thesector we have a radius of sixcentimeters our theta is in radians it's11 PI over 6 we will be using that firstform of because our theta is in radiansour angle measurement is in radians wecan use this one right here alrightlet's go ahead and plug things in youend up with 1/2 times my radius which is6 squared times theta which is 11 PIover 6ok so from here we're gonna use ourorder of operations will be simplifyingthis as much as possible so this goodgive me 1/2 times 36 times 11 PI over 6all right I know that I can simplifythis before I multiply which I prefer todo so I'm gonna end up saying that a 2goes into 36 18 times yeah mm-hmm wellthen say that 6 goes into itself onceI'll go into 18 3 times mmm so thenmultiply straight across you end up with33 pi mmm centimeters squaredyeah just like that and this is gonna beyour exact answer for problem number 3remember if you need to find the decimalnotation for that go ahead and pluggedit into your calculator and go ahead androute it to the nearest thousandthsplace unless otherwise directed by thetextbook or your teacheramen amen I'm gonna buck this up now okread boxing it just like that ladies andgentlemen done mm-hmm moving on toproblem number 4 just turn to page andnow we're on problem number 4 it saysfind the area of the sector we're givenour radius of 16 feet wehave theta in degrees it's 120 degreeshmm so we'll be utilizing the formula Xdivided by 360 times PI R squared let'splug in some values here so I know thatmy X is in degrees so that's gonna be my120 over 360 times pi mm-hmm times myradius squared and my radius justhappens to be 16 so there we have itokay that's a 2 right thereI understand it's an ugly - oh yeahthat's that's atrocious let's fix thatmm-hmmno can't live with that - not gonna dowith it that's not much better but it'sgonna fly okay where to I don't knowusing your order of operations will bebringing down that 120 over 360 times256 pi all right which is the result of16 squared from there we're going tosimplify this what we'll do is we'll saythat 120 goes into itself once 120 goesinto 360 three times uh-huh from therewe'll go ahead and multiply straightacross and so you'll end up with 256 PIover 3 mm-hmm you did a measurement feetsquared there it is ladies and gentlemenand another ugly - I'm gonna keep thatone special to me all right so from herewe'll go ahead and box it up just sayinboxing it up ladies and gentlemen thereit isthere's your result as an exact answer256 PI thirds square feet once again ifyou need decimal notation go ahead andthrow that in your calculator and pressEnter there you have it that's probablybefore let's move along and prime number5 we're given the area of the sector inthis case our area equals 18 PI squareinches our radius is 6 inches andthey're asking us to find theta inradians and because our theta is inradians we'll be using that firstformula that was given to you that areaequals 1/2 the radius squared timestheta because theta has to be in radiansin that formula all right so let's idealfor this situation from here we'll goahead and plug in our values and isolatetheta in order to solve for itit looks like this will have our areaequivalent to 18 pi this equals one-halfsix squared times our theta hereokay then using the order of operationswe'll have 18 pi equals one-half times36 times theta will then take half of 36all right so I'll be bringing down 18 piwhich equals 18 theta okay so from herein order to solve for theta all you haveto do now is divide both sides by 18 allright once I do that I know that thetais equivalent to PI radians and thereyou go that's the answer ladies andgentlemen so in this case we wereworking backwards trying to solve fortheta in this case and we solve for itand we ended up with PI as our exactanswer all right once again if you wantdecimal notation for that for radiansyou'll go ahead and plug PI into yourcalculator and round it to the nearestthousands place or whatever yourtextbook or teacher says because we gotto make them happyall right and for our next problem orthe last problem of this video I'm gonnago ahead and hand it over to our mascotKappa the math muggy for my problemtoday is his final area of the sectorour radius is gonna be 4 meters in V andtheta is 3 PI over 2 our area is gonnabe equivalent to 1/2 the radius squaredtimes theta I'm using this formula righthere because my theta is in radians solet's go ahead and plug in our values Iso you know with 1/2 times our radiuswhich is 4 and it's gonna be squaredtimes R theta which is gonna be 3 PIover 2ok then we're going to use the order ofoperations in order to simplify this soI end up with 1/2 times 16 times 3 PIover 2and I'm going to simplify now I knowthat 2 goes into 16 eight times and 2goes into itself once and will go into 84 timesokay from here we're gonna of effortevery equal sign okay we're gonna fixthat okay okay okaythen multiplying straight across you'llend up with 12 pi and this is gonna bein meters screen that's right squaremeters and that's the answer sohopefully that helps you outand as always oh we got a back seatlet's go ahead and box up our answerokay there we go okay and as alwaysplease rate comment and subscribe and ifyou're able please
