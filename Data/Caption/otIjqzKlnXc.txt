let's start off our lesson on thedistance formula by asking ourselveswhat is distance we can think ofdistance as a length between a startingpoint and an ending point just like astarting line and finish line in100-meter dash when we use the GPS we'relooking at distances between a startingpoint and an ending point starting routeto San Francisco just like the drivefrom San Diego to San Francisco would bea distance of 502 miles so for thislesson we're concerned with finding thedistance between two endpoints connectedby a line segment in this case linesegment CK if we measure this line witha ruler we could say that CK has alength of 13 centimeters and we aregoing to extend this idea of findingdistance between points on thecoordinate plane please note thatdistance is a measure of length thewords are interchangeable and distanceis measured in units finally whenfighting distances on the coordinateplane our tool is not going to be aruler but the distance formulaso let's go ahead and learn how to usethe distance formula our first examplecalls for finding the length of linesegment a B now when we see the wordlength we should be tipped off to usethe distance formula first we're goingto need the coordinates of the endpointsa and B with a at 3/7 at B at 7 for nowagain a and B are both points with x andy-coordinates since a is the first pointwe'll give it the ones x1 y1 and since Bis our second point we'll give it thetwos x2 y2 and now we're ready to useour formula let's start off by lookingat x1 and x2 x2 is 7 X 1 is 3 so we have7 minus 3 in parentheses on the leftside of the equation now we can slidethat over and look at y2 and y1 y2 is 4y 1 is 7 so we have 4 minus 7 in theparentheses on the right side of thedistance formula equation and now thatwe're done substituting we can begin toevaluate 7 minus 3 we know is equal to 4on the right side 4 minus 7 is equal tonegative 3 now we can evaluate theexponents 4 squared is equal to positive16 and we're adding that to negative 3squared which is equal to positive 9remember a negative number squared is apositive value and we know that 16 plus9 is equal to 25 and finally we canevaluate the square root the square rootof 25 is equal to 5so what we just found is that linesegment a B is five units longnow real quick if we look at a B as thehypotenuse of a right triangle we noticethat the legs of the right triangle arethree and four this is your classicthree four five right triangle and thisvalue of five can also be found usingthe Pythagorean theorem so we should seethat the distance formula actually comesfrom the Pythagorean theorem a squaredplus B squared equals C squared for ournext example we're going to be observinga quadrilateral on the coordinate planewith endpoints wyc and M we want to findthe length of line segment WC so we knowwe're going to have to use the distanceformula again notice that W and C arediagonal from each other so this is adiagonal of this four-sided figure so wehave to construct that line to help usvisualize what line segment W see lookslike on the coordinate plane now we canwrite down the coordinates of W atnegative 6 4 that's your x1 y1 and C at4 negative 2 that's your x2 y2 in thedistance formula we can now substitutex2 minus x1 is going to be 4 minusnegative 6 then on the right side of thedistance formula y2 minus y1 will benegative 2 minus 4 so now we cancontinue to evaluate 4 minus negative 6the double negative becomes a positiveso 4 plus 6 equals 10 and on the rightside of parentheses negative 2 minus 4is equal to negative 6now the exponents 10 squared is equal to100 plus negative 6 squared is equal topositive 36 and 100 plus 36 is equal to136 and now we just need the square rootof 136 which is going to equal anirrational numberand since the question asked us to roundto the nearest tenth decimal placearound our answer to eleven point seventhe length of line segment WC oh yeahplease follow us on instagram @ mashupmath for free daily math tips andinfographics
