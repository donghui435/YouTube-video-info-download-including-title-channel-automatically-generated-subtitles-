Hello, everybody.I've got a mathematical card trick for you today.So I'm going to use mathematics to predict a card.First of all, let's shuffle the pack.Now, I've got no fancy shuffles,so I'll just do something like this.And I'm going to split the packinto two halves.Two halves of twenty-six cards.That's not the mathematical bit.So let's split the pack into two halves.1, 2, 3, 4, 56, 7, 8, 9, 10,11, 12, 13, 14, 15,16, 17, 18, 19, 20,21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.All right--just tidy those up.Put those over there, because we don't need them for now.And we're going to use this half of the packand I can shuffle it if I wantto make three pilesand then count up to ten.So three piles, count up to ten.Picture cards count as ten.Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.And seven, eight, nine, ten.Right. If I add up the values of the cards,what have I got?I've got jack is a ten,fifteen,twenty-two.OK, I'm going to take the twenty-second cardin the pile.Well, we've got three piles here.So I'm going to say the card is a nine,and--what--the right-most is a diamond,we've got two spades,a diamond--OK,so I'm going to say it's a diamond,so I'm going to say that the twenty-second cardin the pack is the nine of diamonds.OK, let's do it.Let's take the pack,and count out the twenty-second card.1, 2, 3, 4, 56, 7, 8, 9, 10,11, 12, 13, 14, 15,16, 17, 18, 19, 20,21--the twenty-second card is the nine of diamonds.Let's have a look.And it is!And that's how you use mathematicsto predict a card.So if you have been,thanks for watching.
