two concepts that are related but notthe same are supplementary angles andcomplementary angles the difference isthere's some supplementary angles aretwo angles whose measures sum to 180degrees and complementary are the sumhave to add up to 90 degreesnow I noted here that these do not haveto be adjacentso supplementary angles could beadjacent so if I had angles one and twothose two would be supplementary but Icould also say if we had some angle herethat we said three and let's say threewas equal to sixty degrees and I hadsome other angle over here where I saidat angle 4 was equal to 120 degrees Icould say that these two angles 3 & 4are supplementary because they sum to180 degrees the same is true forcomplementary angles let's look at aspecific example where you might beasked to identify supplementary anglesand complementary angles here we havefive angles 1 2 3 4 & 5 and we're toldthat this angle 3 is 90 degrees now onething that you can assume is that 1 2 &3 are all linear so if you add up 1 2 &3 it would be 180 degrees which meansthat 1 & 2 must also some to 90 degreesso I could label this as a right angleso complementary angles could be angles1 & 2 so I could say angle 1 and angle 2now a supplementary pair could be angle4 and angle 5 which are adjacent andthey are linear so notice that forsupplementary and for complementary youcan't say that 5 angles arecomplementary we're always talking aboutpairs or twos so remember that whenyou're trying to evaluate your problemsthat supplementary sum to 180 degrees ortheir linear and complementary anglessum to 90 degrees
