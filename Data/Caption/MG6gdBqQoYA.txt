okay let's get wild and crazy with ourdots and boxes machines here's a machinebut I'll just stick with boxes going tothe left for now let's keep it simplethat way about playing with boxes to theright it's going mighty fine as well andlet's mess with the numbers at the topthough we've done two one machines andthree one machines and ten more machinesand ex-mo machineslet's get kind of crazy with the numbersa 1:1 machine is my very first questionis a 1:1 machine interesting yes or nowell that's a subjective question so itmight be interesting to you my peers tome might not be - something someone elsebut first of all what happens well putin 1 dot jump one that explodes itbecomes one dot what explores becomes 1dot explodes because 1 dot and in factit just shoots off to infinity soactually it seems pretty wild anduntamed well to me just shoots up toinfinity not much else he can do allrightok ah let's stop messing with thenumbers simply with to one machine wellif I made it a 1 2 machine the other wayaroundhow does that one work well you put in 1dot and explodes it becomes to each ofthose exploits become true so too doesbecome 4 before become 8 off to infinityagain but this time it's like expandingout as it shoots off to infinity againpretty wild not sure if it can be tamednot sure as much to say about that anyother than that ok fineall right 1 2 1 1 let's mess around withboth numbers suppose I did say a 3-2machine aha now three dots explode tobecome 2 and this one's a little moretame let's try it I'm gonna go back tothe very beginning or put it in one dotjump stages 1 dot put in a second dotzoom nothing happens is you need 3 dotsto explores that stays as 2 dots butputting in the third dot zoom 3 doesexplode kaboom to become replaced withtwo dots one place to the left so thecode for 3 now is nothing I think Ithink nothing two dotszero dots to zero for all right that'salways in the white mouse box jump to1/5 jump to 2 and we're feeling a sixthdaughter's gonna be particularlyexciting here it comescabal dot dot kazoo ball dot dot to 1-0grand alright I'll do what I did beforelet's go back to 13what's the code for 13 in a strange 3-2machine whoaI don't know I have no idea what is theMachine doing no idea alright so maybethe way to get the code for 13 is justgo back to start a race all we've gotand just put in 13.6 do it 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 dots all right lots ofexplosions three exploit kaboom to bereplaced by two three explodes becometwo three explode become two Kabangthree exploits we come to yet againgolly gee all right one dot left overand a bunch of dots here three explodecome become too cuz you become two and Iguess that leaves what two dots herepretty smudgy sorry about thatuh-oh I still got three dots and withinhere that can explode kaboom ball dotdot that's it two one two one two onetwo one the code for 13 is too messytwo one two one Wow let me just writethem all neatly 13 apparently is two onetwo oneokay all right ours are fun to be hadworking out code so different numbersbut the real question of course in mybrain right now is what is this machineactually doing oh we are some kind ofbase arithmetic like we were before itwas there something brand-new what'sactually happening herealright okay so I'm gonna try to figurethis out now so let me just clear thebox the Machine again so all the boxesget cleared okay now we have played thisgame that every game we play so far hasbeen dots here are always worth one sowe know those are worth 1 and we knowthat three of these explode to make twoof those so three dots here isequivalent to two dots here so thatmakes me wonder could I figure out thevalue of a dot in this place well Idon't know what the what the bet isgoing to be let me just write just writeW for what I don't know what it's goingto be but we do know that twoonce two dots here is the same as threeones three dots here oh okay this littlepiece of rithmetic I can do to what it'sthe same as three ones I let's divideboth sides by 2 and I get that what mustbe worth three halves one and a half allright three halves okay let's keep goingso I do know that if I go next spot overthree dots here three three halves isequivalent Kabangto two dots here all right so what's thevalue of a dot here um well I won't useW again I'll use B but I don't know whatit's going to be all right so I do knowthat two votes is the same as threethree halveshaha let's divide both sides by two andI see that Vaught is three halvessquared that's 9 fourths I thinksomething's going on here this is threehalves squared nine fourths so I bet wehave a prediction for the value of thisone let me call it a WB let's call it Zor Z space what country you're in allrightZed I do know that three of these threethree halves squared is the same as twoZed's so three sorry 2 zs is the same as3 3 halves squared little bit messy myfingers are smudgy two Tuesday's thesame as three three halves squareddivide each side by 2 I see that Z isindeed three halves cubed that's whattwenty seven eighths well bingo lookslike we are working with somethingequivalent to base three-halves spaceone and a half in some sense I bet hedid the next one will be indeed threehalves to the fourth power was theregonna be 80 1/16 and so on Wow um I babya little bit careful here calling thisbase one and half because somemathematicians will object to thisbecause the coefficient I've got here iszeros ones and twos and two is actuallybigger than our base numbers it's a bitweird but in some sense it really isworking with powers of three hourshell's one and a half with thesecoefficients so some say there is a basea version of base 1/2 Wowall right okay so I can look at this andsay great we've seen space one and ahalf in some sense I'm gonna be carefulwith that in some space one and a halfdo you know what I actually don'tbelieve it I mean even though Iintellectual you've just done this Ijustintuitively don't understand it I meanthis really throws me let me think aboutit think about this 13 that's a goodsolid whole numbers a right whole numberright on the nose a whole number yetapparently it's composed of these wackyfractions it says that if you take twoof these guys to twenty seven eighthsand one of these one 9/4 and two ofthese to three-halves and one one thatthose horrible fractions they're reallyghastly fractions magically combinedperfectly to be a good solid wholenumber on the nose doesn't feel right tome doesn't even feel possible I mean ofcourse I wanna check it but I can'tcheck it back I will check it let'scheck it right now so we're saying thattwo twenty seven eighths three-halvescubed and one this direction is ninefourths and two three tooth and one oneall those numbers magically bind to be aperfect thirteen well do I believe thatlet's see what do we get to twenty seveneighths that's twenty seven fourths plus9/4 plus 2 times 3 to 6 3 plus 1 ah 27fourths and 9 force that's 36 fourthsplus 3 plus 136 fourths plus 4 36 fourththat's 9 9 plus 4 is indeed 13 whoa whoait works out okay so yes we can actuallyencode numbers using the coefficients 01 & 2 with powers of 1 and 1/2 here is avery interesting version of somethingcould be called base 1/2 or whatever Wowum of course now I'm wondering can I doa whisper tic in this weird base wellfor example let's go with 13 still Iknow an ordinary thematic that's 6 plus6 plus 1 is 13 now this sort of base 3to version of this would be 6 6 is 2 1 0plus another 6 2 1 0 plus of 1 1 is 1yep adds up to something is it 13 let'ssee I'll go left to right 2 plus 2 is 41 plus 1 is 2 0 plus 0 plus 1 is 1 4 2 1however I know if there's gonna beexplosions herefor dr. lebackes three of them explodesbecome two and leave what one behindso three exploit become two leaving onebehind the other ones remain on touchlook at thatit really is 13 so it looks like I needto do some basic arithmetic in thestrange machine in fact here's optionalhomework optional means don't do itunder any circumstances that is gothrough your current math textbook andconvert everything from base 10 from a10-1 language to the space 3 hardslanguage well that'd be fun well theyjust confuse over each your book nextall right but actually this is wonderfulthis is wild and crazy so I've done somebasic arithmetic it seems to work sonatural question is does all arithmeticwork for example can I do division inthis weird base does it work the sameway I don't know try itum if I actually start doing decimalsbut gonna be killed like hardcore themdecimals so decimals means deci means 10so first of all think of a name what tocall things that way can I writefractions in this sort of a decimallyway what am i call it does it work thatway do all fractions give repeatingdecimal expansions in fact there's allthese interesting questions we askedabout this very machine here in factsome questions actually unsolved to thisday you could be embarking on brand newthinking and brand new math doing whichis amazing um but why stop there 3 tostop playing with other numbers do 5 4do 7 negative 16 or something whatevermakes an strikes play with itseedings discover something new negativebases irrational bases wow what auniverse of wonder and delight andmystery intrigue all coming from asimple dots and boxes machine this isastounding you are now at the forefrontof mathematics research go for it havefun with it play with it hours hoursdays months years of little fun hereright here wonderful stuff
