Hello, everyone!OK, I've got a new one for you today.It's one that I only learned myself last year.When I saw it, I was really impressed.It's called "Simpson's Paradox."OK, it's not about why it sucked after season nine.Or why the glove didn't fit.There you go! Two references, fifteen years out of date.That's a good way to start a video.No--instead, you're suffering from a mysterious,and embarrassing,  illness, OK--so, the best kind, really.There are two drugs to cure this illness--Drug A, Drug B.So we put them on trial.On Day 1,Drug A cures 63 out of 90 people.So, hurray!Cures 63 out of 90 people.Or, in other words, it cures 70% of people.Now, again, on Day 1,Drug B cures 8 out of 10 people.So it cures 80% of people.So on Day 1, Drug B is winning. It cures 80% of people,versus 70% of people.Right. So Day 2,we try the drugs again.On Day 2, Drug A cures 4 out of 10 people.So, hurray.Right. Cures 4 out of 10 people,or to put it another way,it cures 40% of people.Drug B, however,cures 45 out of 90 people,so it cures 50% of people.So, again, Drug B wins. It cures 50% of people,versus 40% of people.So Drug B appears to be the better drug.It's better on Day 1, and it's better on Day 2.But, have a look!Overall--overall, Drug A cures 63 people there, 4 people there,so it cures 67 out of 100 people.It cures 67 out of 100 people--67%.Drug B, however,cures 8 people there, 45 people there,It cures 53 out of 100 people--so it cures 53% of people.So overall, Drug A appears to be better.It cures 67% versus 53%. So this is the paradox.Which is the better drug?Drug B appears to be better on Day 1,and better on Day 2,but overall, Drug A appears to be better.Which is the better drug?In fact, this paradox is fairly easy to solve.It's Drug A.Drug A is the better drug.This is the result to use.The overall result--it cures 67% of people.Drug A is the better drug.Now, if you just follow the percentages alone,then you will come to the wrong conclusion.So if you just look at the 70%, the 80%,the 40% and the 50%,you will come to the wrong conclusionthat Drug B is the better drug.But you see, these things are weighted.They're not the same.We're not comparing like with like here.So we cured 63 out of 90 people there,and only 8 out of 10 people there.You're not comparing the same thing.So it is this figurethat you should be using--the overall  result.Now, this is not just in medical trials.This turns up in sport statistics,exam results,all sorts of places.It's really important to be able to interpretyour results correctly.Or otherwise, you'll just end up sticking pins in peopleto cure people's headaches, which would bea ridiculous thing to do!So that's all for now.And, if you have been,thanks for watching.
