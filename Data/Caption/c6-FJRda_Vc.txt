y is directly proportional to x.If y equals 30 when
x is equal to 6,find the value of
x when y is 45.So let's just take this
each statement at a time.y is directly proportional to x.That's literally
just saying that yis equal to some
constant times x.This statement can
literally be translatedto y is equal to some
constant times x.y is directly proportional to x.Now, they tell us, if
y is 30 when x is 6--and we have this constant
of proportionality--this second statement
right over hereallows us to solve
for this constant.When x is 6, they
tell us y is 30so we can figure out
what this constant is.We can divide both
sides by 6 and weget this left-hand side is
5-- 30 divided by 6 is 5.5 is equal to k or
k is equal to 5.So the second sentence tells us,
this gives us the informationthat y is not just k
times x, it tells usthat y is equal to 5 times
x. y is 30 when x is 6.And then finally, they say, find
the value of x when y is 45.So when y is 45 is
equal to-- so we're justputting in 45 for y--
45 is equal to 5x.Divide both sides
by 5 to solve for x.We get 45 over 5 is 9, and
5x divided by 5 is just x.So x is equal to 9 when y is 45.
