When we observe
the physical world,we find a random
fluctuations everywhere.We can generate
truly random numbersby measuring random
fluctuations known as noise.When we measure this
noise, known a sampling,we can obtain numbers.For example, if we measure
the electric currentof TV static over time, we
will generate a truly randomsequence.We can visualize
this random sequenceby drawing a path
that changes directionaccording to each number,
known as a random walk.Notice the lack of
pattern at all scales.At each point in the
sequence, the next moveis always unpredictable.Random processes are said
to be non-deterministic,since they're impossible
to determine in advance.Machines on the other
hand, are deterministic.Their operation
predictable and repeatable.In 1946, John von
Neumann was involvedin running computations for the
military, specifically involvedin the design of
the hydrogen bomb.Using a computer
called the ENIAC,he planned to
repeatedly calculateapproximations of the processes
involved in nuclear fission.However, this required
quick access to randomlygenerated numbers that
could be repeated if needed.However, the ENIAC had very
limited internal memory.Storing long random
sequences was not possible.So Neumann developed
an algorithmto mechanically simulate the
scrambling aspect of randomnessas follows.First, select a truly random
number, called the seed.This number comes from
the measurement of noise,or the current time
in milliseconds.Next, this seed is provided as
input to a simple calculation.Multiply this seed by itself.And then output the
middle of this result.Then you use this
output as the next seedand repeat the process
as many times as needed.This is known as the
middle-squares method,and is just the first in a long
line of pseudo random numbergenerators.The randomness of
the sequence isdependent on the randomness
of the initial seed only.Same seed, same sequence.So what are the differences
between a randomly generatedversus pseudorandomly
generated sequence?Let's represent each
sequence as a random walk.They seem similar until
we speed things up.The pseudorandom sequence
must eventually repeat.This occurs when the
algorithm reachesa seed it has previously
used, and the cycle repeats.The lengths, before a
pseudorandom sequence repeats,is called the period.The period is strictly
limited by the lengthof the initial seed.For example, if we
use a two digit seed,then an algorithm can
produce at most 100 numbersbefore reusing a seed
and repeating the cycle.A three digit seed can
expand past 1,000 numbersbefore repeating its cycle.And a four digit seed can
expand past 10,000 numbersbefore repeating.Though if we use a
seed large enough,the sequence can expand
into trillions and trillionsof digits before repeating,
though the key differenceis important.When you generate
numbers pseudorandomly,there are many sequences,
which cannot occur.For example, Alice generates
a truly random sequenceof 20 shifts.It's equivalent to
a uniform selectionfrom the stack of all
possible sequences of shifts.This stack contains
26 to the power20 pages, which is
astronomical in size.If we stood at the bottom
and shined a light upwards,a person at the
top would not seethe light for around
200 million years.Compare this to Alice generating
a 20 digit pseudorandomsequence using a four
digit random seed.Now this is equivalent
to a uniform selectionfrom 10,000 possible
initial seeds.Meaning, she can only generate
10,000 different sequences,which is a vanishingly
small fractionof all possible sequences.When we move from random
to pseudorandom shifts,we shrink the key space into a
much, much smaller seed space.So for a pseudorandom
sequence to beindistinguishable from a
randomly generated sequence,it must be impractical for
a computer to try all seedsand look for a match.This leads to an important
distinction in computer sciencebetween what is
possible, versus whatis possible in a
reasonable amount of time.We use the same logic
when we buy a bike lock.We know that anybody can simply
try all possible combinationsuntil they find a
match and it opens.But it would take
them days to do so.So for eight hours.We assume it's practically safe.With pseudorandom
generators, the securityincreases as the length
of the seed increases.If the most powerful computer
would take hundreds of yearsto run through all
seeds, then we safelycan assume it's practically
secure, instead of perfectlysecure.As computers get
faster, the seed sizemust increase accordingly.Pseudorandomness
frees Alice and Bobfrom having to share
their entire random shiftsequence in advance.Instead, they share a
relatively short random seed,and expand it into the same
random looking sequencewhen needed.But what happens
if they can nevermeet to share this random seed?
