hey this is pressure Locker ABCD is arectanglepoint P is 11 units from a 13 units fromB and 7 units from C what is thedistance from P to D note the point Pcould either be inside the rectangle orit could also be outside the rectangle avariant of this problem was asked as aninterview question at Microsoft can youfigure it out give this problem a tryand when you're ready keep watching thevideo or the solutionthere is a special equation that alwaysworks for rectangles and a given point Pit doesn't matter whether the point isinside the rectangle or outside therectangle it is always true that APsquared plus C P squared is equal to B Psquared plus D P squared in other wordsthe sum of the squared distances from Pto a set of opposite corners of therectangle is equal to the same sum ofthe squared distances of P to the otherset of opposite corners in the rectanglethis equation will make quick work ofthe problem we were given that a Pequals 11 B P equals 13 and C P equals 7we can substitute those values into ourequation and then we can simplify it andthen solve the DP must be equal to 1 sothis is a fantastic formula because wecan figure out the distance to thefourth corner from knowing the distancesto the other three corners and we don'tneed to know whether P is inside therectangle or outside the rectangle andwe don't know anything about therectangle like its length and width wecan still figure out the distance from Pto the fourth corner of the rectanglenow this is a rarely taught equation butit has a kind of interesting name we canrepresent it geometrically as follows wehave a P squared which we can representas an area that's a square C P squaredwe can also draw a square for the otherdistances we'll draw them as red squaresfor this equation to be true it meansthat the total area of the blue squaresis equal to the total area of the redsquares now this diagram has a vagueresemblance to the Union Jack and sothis is actually known as the Britishflag theorem it's rarely taught inschoolbut as we'll see it's actually anextension of the Pythagorean theorem sonow let's prove why this equation istrue we'll start out with the rectangleand we'll put point P inside therectangle the proof will be similar whenP is outside the rectangle so now we'lldraw all of the distances from thecorners to the point P what we'll do iswe'll draw a vertical line that'sperpendicular to C D and a B that runsthrough P we'll label the intersectionsas E and F we're now going to write insome variables for the distances willsay that the horizontal distance from ato P is equal to W the horizontaldistance from B to P is equal to X wellthen say the vertical distance from a toP is equal to Y and the verticaldistance from P to D is equal to Z sobecause this is a rectangle we canactually label some of the other lengthsin this figure we know that DF will alsobe equal to W and C F will also be equalto X so now where does this gets wellyou can see that we have four righttriangles that involve the fourdistances to P that we want so we canfigure out the squared distances usingthe Pythagorean theorem AP squared willbe equal to W squared plus y squared B Psquared will be equal to x squared plusy squared C P squared will be equal to xsquared plus Z squared and then DPsquared will be equal to W squared plusZ squared now if you add up thevariables correctly it is obvious thatAP squared plus C P squared is equal toB P squared plus D P squared becauseboth of them willbe equal to x squared plus y squaredplus W squared plus Z squaredthus we proven the British flag theoremdid you figure it out thanks forwatching this video please subscribe tomy channel I make videos on math andgame theory you can catch around my blogmind your decisions that you can followon Facebook Google+ and patreon you cancatch me on social media at pressureLocker and if you like this video pleasecheck out my books there are links inthe video description
