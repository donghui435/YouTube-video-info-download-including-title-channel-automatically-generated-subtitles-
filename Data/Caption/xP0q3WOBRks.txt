close your eyes I want you to picturethe knowledge that's in your head rightnow can you feel it one way I can probeyour knowledge is by asking youquestions that is things you can knowwithout leaving your chair withoutinteracting with the world in any waynone of your senses are allowed do youthink this collection of knowledge cangrow just by sitting there pondering toyourself now you can open your eyesthe process of going from question to adefinite answer is at the root of logiclogic explores arguments for truth whenwe walk this pathway from question toanswerwe call it reasoning and logic is thestudy of sequences of reasoning a bigreason why Aristotle's ideas on logicmatter today is because he steered thesubject in what we'd now call the moderndirection he wanted to define perfectarguments for truth so he looked forgeneral patterns that is things thatmake something true no matter whatsubject you are thinking of this iscalled abstract thought but what exactlyis abstraction close your eyes one moretime imagine a tree you've never seennow you have some abstract concept oftree in your head which was justactivated it's abstract because it's nota memory of a tree you've seen in thepast it's a more general concept orfeeling of what you associate with Trenas-- with it you can generate new treesin your mind you've never seen beforenow open your eyes your idea of tree isgeneral enough to fit with any specifictree I show you you can carry all treesin your head that's abstraction killedRanbir acting when they come tounderstand shapes and numbers ascategories can you make two towersand words or symbols act as the bridgebetween physical things and abstractconcepts for example as a child youmemorize the word tree perhaps using aspecific example but tree became a labelfor your tree category for Aristotle itwas important to separate these abstractcategories from specific physical thingsin our worldhe called this physical matter theprimary substance and the abstractcategories in our mind as the secondarysubstance you also have another wordhuman which defines this abstractcategory which all people have existedand will exist belong to what'simportant to see here is that the humancategory and the tree category don'tcontain any shared stuff there are nohuman trees but abstract categories cancontain each other for example mortalitycontains both trees and humans so theseare the categories which Aristotledescribes as secondary substances andoften when we are making statementsabout the world we are actually justexpressing connections betweencategories and Aristotle shows this witha very simple example known as aproposition of the forum all somethingare something such as all humans aremortalremember when we make this claim we aresaying that all things we could point toin the physical world will follow thispattern while the opposite isn'tnecessarily trueso these statements are like buildingblocks for Aristotle his whole system isbuilt on a very simple rule about themvalid statements must be true or falsebut never both true and false at thesame time known as the law ofnon-contradiction next he shows how wecan then combine these statements tobuild newBooth's and his idea is based on how weargue that something is true or not ifwe try to make a logical argument thatmeans we are arranging a sequence ofstatements people already agree on astrue and build to the statement inquestion he thought of this as a perfectargument since there is never a stepwhere things break down known asdeduction a common example how can weprove that the statement all Greeks aremortal is true to answer thisdeductively aristotle uses a conditionalstatement as the framework which leadsto the following form if all statementone and all statement two then allstatement threeand he puts the statement we want toprove as true at the bottom of thissequence the process of deduction is tofill in statement one and two usingknowledge which is already agreed on astrue so one thing we already know is allhumans are mortal now we just needanother statement which helps us connectGreek nostalgia our human if all Greeksare human and all humans are mortalthen all Greeks are mortal the first twostatements are known as the premise ofour argument and the third is thelogical conclusion if we can agree thatthe premises are true then theconclusion must follow this is known asa syllogism but Aristotle only usespecific examples to get people to hiscore idea his big leap was to see thatwe only need to look at the structure ofthe words not the content of the wordsremember your way of representing thecategory Greek could be this combinationof letters in English or maybe yourepresent it as the color blue in somesort of color language so now let's puttogether the same argument using thiscolor system notice the colors bring outthe pattern to his system more clearlywe connect Bluegreen concepts using ashared yellow concept known as themiddle term so the final step aristotletook was to remove the content of thisargument from the form that is forgetwhat the colors even represent think ofthem as variables so any words orcategories you choose to replace thecolors blue yellow and green will stillresult in a valid argument leading tosome true statement try itsyllogisms while simple are importantbecause they act as building blocks foreven more complex arguments allowing usto chain together statements whichconnect and quantify any abstract ideaswe wantlogic allows us to reason about theworld abstractly without any physicalbasis we can just sit in our chairs andexpend energy on abstractions but whatis the limit of logic that is are theresome true statements which are out ofreach of logic
