first thing you want to know is thesurface area of an entire sphere andremember when you're talking aboutsurface area or talking about that outersurface you know the area if you were tocover this with little 1x1 squareyou know patches right how many wouldcover that outer surface and the formulais 4 times pi times the radius squaredbut then what we do with the hemisphereis we go ahead and we cut it in halfright so now what happens when you go tocut this in half is this surface righthere okay is going to be 2 PI R squaredbecause half of 4 PI R squared but inthe process of cutting it in half weexpose this bottom circle here so whenyou're cutting it like in half like thisnow if you were to pick this up okay andlook at that part right there you cansee it's going to be a circle and youthat's also now becoming the outersurface that we know the area of acircle is PI R squared or you can thinkof it as 1 PI R squared so if you addthese together a hemisphere the surfacearea is actually 3 PI R squared sosometimes students mistakenly say 2 PI Rsquared we want 3 PI R squared so aquick example is if they give you theradius is 5 real simple you just putthat in for the radius it's going to be3 times pi times 5 squared that's 25times 3 which is 75 PI units squaredwhatever the units are it's square unitsso I hope this helped you understand howto work with hemispheres a little bitbetter if you're interested in onlinetutoring with me feel free to contact meabout that otherwise subscribe to thechannel check out more math tutoringvideos on my youtube channel Mario'smath tutoring and I look forward toseeing you in the future videos I'lltalk to you soon
