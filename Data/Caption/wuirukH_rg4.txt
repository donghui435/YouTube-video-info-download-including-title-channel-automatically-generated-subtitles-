hello my name is Maria Mueller frommadman welcomein this video I want to show you how touse a protractor to measure angles andon my board I have three differentprotractors right now and the protractoralways has numbers here going up downand it is actually two sets of numbersgoing from 0 to 180 yeah it goessomething from here 0 to 180 here thenit also has another set of numbers theintercept from 0 here to 180 here thenit has a baseline in my big protractorthe baseline is here and then somewhereit has a point where we need to line upthe vertex of the angle the origin ifyou want to call it that in my bigprotractor it is here at the number ofthing but it's not markedand the important thing in using aprotractor is that we need to line upthe side of the animal with the baselineof the protractor we need to line up theverdicts or the corner of the angle withthe origin here and then we need toremember three the right set of numbersnext we are going to look at the littleprotractor see in the top littleprotractor the base line of the zeroline is right here it goes to the numberzero on the side and on this until it isnot the very bottom of the protractor soone has to be careful to line up theside of the animal not with the bottomof the protractor but with this blueline and then the origin weight line ofthe vertex is right there and with thisprotractor the base line is here and theorigin is here it is not the base lineis not here this is does the ruler partthat you could use to measure things incentimeter I will now measure these fouranimals with my big protractor I willline up the base line with a side of theangle which is here and I also have topost my origin which is here the number15 to the vertso the angle then I would read thenumbers here where this other side ofthe animal heats it and there's two setsof numbers like I said one goes from 010 20 30 40 50 60 the other one goes his170 160 150 and so I use the set ofnumbers where zero is for this linethere would be here so 10 20 30 40 thisis probably degrees now an error thatstudents might make is its to line upthis side of the angle with the baseline of the protractor but this will notwork because the animal is like openinglike that and you need to have theprotractor so that the other side wallwill be here okay this is a little oneand this time I will line up the baseline here with this side but now Inotice that my annal is under theprotractor if this happens what to do isyou continue the size especially thesecond big long dayyeah the zero is here so I use thenumbers 10 20 30 these are two numbersit is almost 80 I would say 77 degreesnow let's write it the next animal Icould line up with this side on thisside which is true every time I I hadtwo possibilities okay well it is a bigthing and now the zero is here it's onan angle opens up all the way here and 010 20 I use the top numbers which isit's between 130 and 140 degreesnow it's about it's 135 this is anobtuse angle and the last angle hereit's kind of interesting we are notactually measuring in this part herethis angle is acutewe have supposed to measure this unknownhere it's called a reflex angle becauseit's more than 180 degrees it's thisangle here if you stop hereI cannot directly measure it with theprotractor but I can measure this acuteangle here and then use subtractionmeasure the acute angle find a placewith the base this silent attacker namefrom hereBruce Lee dose for the degrees this yearis 40 degrees but this one here is 360minus for the degreesso there's actually three hundred point
