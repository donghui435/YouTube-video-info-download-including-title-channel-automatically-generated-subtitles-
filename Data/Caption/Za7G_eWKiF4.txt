The marching band is holding a
raffle at a football game withtwo prizes.After the first ticket is pulled
out and the winnerdetermined, the ticket is
taped to the prize.The next ticket is pulled out to
determine the winner of thesecond prize.Are the two events
independent?Explain.Now before we even think about
this exact case, let's thinkabout what it means for events
to be independent.It means that the outcome of one
event doesn't affect theoutcome of the other event.Now in this situation, the first
event-- after the firstticket is pulled out and the
winner determined-- the ticketis taped to the prize.Then the next ticket is pulled
out to determine the winner ofthe second prize.Now, the winner of the second
prize-- the possible winners,the possible outcomes for the
second prize, is dependent onwho was pulled out for
the first prize.You can imagine if there's
three tickets, let's saythere's tickets A, B,
and C in the bag.And for the first prize,
they pull out ticket A.That's for the first prize.Now, when we think about who
could be pulled out for thesecond prize, it's only going
to be tickets B or C.Now the first prize could
have gone the other way.It could have been
A, B, and C.The first prize could have
gone to ticket B.And then the possible outcomes
for the second prizewould be A or C.So the possible outcomes for
the second event, for thesecond prize, are completely
dependent on what happened orwhat ticket was pulled out
for the first prize.So these are not independent
events.The second event-- the outcomes
for it, are dependenton what happened in
the first event.So they are not independent.The way that we could have
made them independent is,after the first ticket was
pulled out, if they just wrotedown the name or something,
and then putthat ticket back in.Instead they taped
it to the prize.But if they put that ticket
back in, then the secondprize, it would have still had
all the tickets there.It wouldn't have mattered who
was picked out in the firsttime because their name was just
written down, but theirticket was put back in.And then you would have
been independent.So if you had replaced the
ticket, you would have beenindependent.But since they didn't replace
the ticket, they taped it tothe prize, these are not
independent events.
