it's possible to have a system ofequations with no solution and here's anexample two equations here y equals xplus 3 and y equals x minus 1 and youcan tell by looking at the equationsthat each of these lines has a slope of1 and you can see this if you graph themto this first one y equals x plus 3 hasa y-intercept of 3 and a slope of 1 sowe can draw this graph in ok and thenthe second one y equals x minus 1 wehave a y-intercept of negative 1 and aslope of 1and you see the key point right here thelines are parallel and you remember fromour study of lines that lines that havethe same slope are parallel and so youcan see that that is why there is nosolution every point on this linesatisfies this equation but none ofthose points are on this line at thesame time so none of those points canalso satisfy the other equation thelines don't intersect so there's nopoint that lies on both lines at thesame time so we say that there is nosolution to the system of equations andif you were writing down your answerthat's what you would write you wouldsimply write no solution and maybe add alittle explanation no solution becausethe lines are parallel and again we cansee that from the graph or we can seethat from looking at the values for theslope
