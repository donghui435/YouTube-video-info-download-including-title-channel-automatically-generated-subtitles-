When people talk about the physics of American
football, they normally mention force, torque,and so on¡­Like how the energy from two linemen colliding
is enough to power a 60W light bulb for overa minute, or is equivalent to an average person
falling two stories off of a building!But there's another aspect of physics in football
that isn't talked about as much ¨C symmetry!You might think symmetry is just for butterflies
and rorschach tests, but it's all over theplace in football: there's translational symmetry
when teams keep the same formations as theymove up or down the field, and rotational
symmetry when they switch sides after a touchdown.Even the ball has axial symmetry so it can
spin smoothly through the air.But why is symmetry useful in the first place?Symmetry makes things easier, or at least
more efficient; it gives you a guide: "samescenario, same action."That means you don't have to reinvent the
wheel all the time: to draw a straight line,you just keep drawing in the same direction.For a circle, keep curving the same amount.So when football players practice a play over
and over, the patterns of football becomeso ingrained in their reflexes they can act
without thinking.Psychologists call this "habit formation";
we call it "symmetry in time"!And when players line up on the field the
same way at the thirty, or forty, or fiftyyard lines, that's "symmetry in space".Even physics itself is symmetric ¨C ever
heard of Newton's law: "a body in motion tendsto stay in motion"?That's just nature saying "keep doing the
same thing."What's more, Newton's laws of motion are the
same now as they were yesterday, and they'llbe the same again tomorrow!Doesn't that make life easy?Ultimately, symmetry is what allows both science
AND football to function - if the laws ofthe universe (or the rules of football) changed
from day to day, we wouldn't be able to repeatexperiments, make predictions, or know what
plays to practice.So when you reach for yet another handful
of chips while watching the next footballgame, know that millions across the country
are doing exactly the same, in perfect symmetry.
