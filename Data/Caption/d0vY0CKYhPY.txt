HOLLY KRIEGER: So what I want to talk aboutis what is maybethe least efficient way possibleto approximate the number pi.BRADY HARAN: Well, that's not a good sell!HOLLY KRIEGER: It's not a good sellbut it's really interesting.So I wanna talk about approximating pi in the Mandelbrot setMaybe it's best to do a bit of a reminder aboutwhat the Mandelbrot set is.So, remember, the Mandelbrot setwas this object that we have in thecomplex plane.So, here are the real numbers.And here are the imaginary numbers.And the Mandelbrot set  was a collection ofcomplex numbers, so I'll try and sort ofdraw a nice version of this here.And-- it's complicated, right?And it was this collection ofcomplex numbers that had the propertythat when we look at the functionz squared plus c and we applyit to zero, so zero plugged into this functionis c, and then we do that againwith the output.So c plugged into this function is c squared plus c .And so on.A number c is in the Mandelbrot set exactlywhen when we do this process and repeat and repeat and repeatThe number stays smaller than or equal to two.But today I'm not too worried about complex numbers.I just want to talk about real numbers in the Mandelbrot set.BRADY HARAN: Does that mean we're just talking about things along the line?HOLLY KRIEGER: Exactly, exactly.And in fact I'm just gonna be interested in what happensOn this portion of the real line here.So, one thing that I should say firstis that this point, this point is called the cuspof the Mandelbrot set.And this point is exactly the value wherec is one quarter.BRADY HARAN: That's the last point on the real line-- in that direction.That's in the Mandelbrot set. And pi is here somewhere presumably.So pi is not in the Mandelbrot set.HOLLY KRIEGER: Pi is not in the Mandelbrot set.That's absolutely right.And when I say that I'm going to approximate pi in the Mandelbrot setI don't mean I am just gonna approximate pi on this picture hereI mean that I'm gonna cook up a bunch of numbers that have to dowith the Mandelbrot setthat approximate pi.BRADY HARAN: So you're going to use the Mandelbrot set as a tool.HOLLY KRIEGER: As a tool to approximate pi, exactly.And, of course, you know, looking at this you can say "well, it lookslike there's a circle in there".Which, indeed, this is a circle.Inside of the Mandelbrot set.But I'm not gonna use that one,that's a little too straightforward of a way to get pi.So, here's the idea.What happens if we take a real numberThat's larger than one fourth.So, as you said, it's not in the Mandelbrot set.Right?And what that means-- let's call this number...Say... uh....Well, I've already used c, but let's call it c anywaysWhatever this number c is, when we start doing this processfor this number c, we look at the function z squared plus cand we plug in zero and we output c.Then we plug in the outputand we get c squared plus c, then we plugin that output and so on.At some point, these numbers are gonna be larger than two.Right, because that was our restrictionthat you're not in the Mandelbrot set if these numbersare eventually larger than two.Okay?So what we're gonna do is to eachnumber cwe're gonna associate this number, say, N of c.And this is equal to the numberof steps of iterating zero under z squared plus c--So exactly the process I was describing before--Until we get something larger than two.BRADY HARAN: Any number after the cusp?HOLLY KRIEGER: Yes.BRADY HARAN: Is a killer? It's gonna kill the Mandelbrot set?HOLLY KRIEGER: That's right, it eventually gets big.BRADY HARAN: The thing you're interested in nowis how quickly that number will kill us?HOLLY KRIEGER: Exactly. And this is somethingthat's totally natural to be interested inThis is how people draw pictures of the Mandelbrot setfor example, is exactly counting these kinds of steps.So if we start with the real number c that's larger than twothen after the first stepof iteration here we get c itself which is larger than two.And so we know that after just one stepthat that parameter cannot possibly be in the Mandelbrot set.So in that case, N of c is just equal to one.And we have this very small value of N.BRADY HARAN: And that applies to all numbers above two.HOLLY KRIEGER: That's right, but as you mightimagine,  the closer you get into the cusp, the moresteps it takes to get larger than two, right?We're starting with the smaller number here and so it takesmore steps to get there.All right. So let's make this a little bit precise.We start with a number really close to one fourth, say...Say, c equals one fourth plus epsilon.Where this is some very small positive and real number.BRADY HARAN: So we're just after the cusp.HOLLY KRIEGER: That's right, you're just to the right of the cusp.On the real axis there. And then wecount the number of steps it takes us to escapeThis is something you can do in, say, you know, Wolfram|Alpha or Sage or whatever.Can be the program you wanna use. So if you drawa table of how this number N of c depends as epsilonis coming in and getting smaller and smaller,we're coming in towards the cusp with cyou can actually count, just by iterating, how long does it take to havea number that's larger than two.So for example, if epsilon is one, then c is one plus one fourth, which is one point two five.Then N of c is just two.It only takes two steps to get larger than two.BRADY HARAN: Well that was, uh, that was over quickly.HOLLY KRIEGER: That's right. On the other hand if wetake some much more reasonable value of epsilon, say likeOne one-hundredth, and so c is point two six, say...Then the number of steps it takes to escape turns out to beThirty, actually.And if we take epsilon to be, sayEven smaller, and so c is even closer to one quarter, then the value we get in that case is three fifteen.BRADY HARAN: Oh, wow, that's a lot of steps.HOLLY KRIEGER: It's a lot of steps, right, but we're reallyclose to the cusp here, it should take a lot of steps to escape.And if we take epsilon even smaller, so that c is even closer to the cuspWe get something even better.Even larger value of N of c.BRADY HARAN: Ooooh...HOLLY KRIEGER: But you can see something suspicious happening here, right?BRADY HARAN: I can see it. We can all see it.HOLLY KRIEGER: Everyone can see it.So, what's happening here is as long as you put the decimalpoint in the right placeAnd as you can see, I've changed my epsilon sort of regularly here, so the decimalpoint kind of moves regularly, too.As long as you put the decimal pointin the right place, these values N of care actually converging to pi.BRADY HARAN: That's cool!HOLLY KRIEGER: Yeah, yeah! So you get these approximations of piright, okay, three point one five is not such a good approximationthree point one four is a little better, it turns out the next oneis something like three one four one four.Which is even betterand so on.And so, this tremendously inefficient method of taking some valueof c that's really close to the cusp of the Mandelbrot set and iteratingit many thousands of times until you get a number that's larger than twowill give you approximates of pi.
