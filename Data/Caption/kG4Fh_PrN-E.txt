if you roll a pair of regular dice whatare the possible outcomes this tableshows the sum for each possible roll sofor example if die one is a three anddie two is a five we get eight in factyou see that there are five ways toproduce the number eight this tableshows the frequency distribution of allthe possible outcomes the numbers from 2to 12 again we see that there are 5 waysto produce an 8 ok this is all standardbut here's the crazy question is there adifferent way to label the dice withpositive integers so that the frequencydistribution stays the same remarkablythere is in the 1970s George Z Kermanfound this new labeling with one two twothree three four on one die and onethree four five six eight on the otherdie if we look for example for a sum of8 we find five possibilities just likewith the regular dice this table showsthat we have the same distribution forevery number like before how on earthwould you find these weird dice let'ssee how to mathematically approach thiswe represent the roll of one regular diewith this polynomial Y we can write itlike this this means that if we roll thedie there is one way to get a three oneway to get a five or any other numberfrom 1 to 6 what if we roll two dicethen we square the polynomial thisexpands to produce this expression thistells us that there are five ways to getan eight just like we saw before thepolynomial for one die can be factoredlike this and of course we could do thesame for a second die now take thefactor x squared minus X plus 1 from die1 and give it to die 2 the product ofthese two polynomials hasn't changed butexpanding each polynomial individuallyproduces this these polynomials nolonger represent regularnice they are the Z Kermit dice this isthe only way to produce two distinctsix-sided dice that give the samedistribution as a regular pair of dicewe can push this idea to a pair ofdifferent size two dice for example ifthe dice could have four sides and ninesides here is the way to get the sameresults as two regular dice these arethe polynomials that produce this newcombination here's a question for youcan you find two other ways to get thestandard distribution for the four-sideddie and a nine sided die note that toget only one outcome of two you knowthat the lowest numbers on each die mustbe a 1can you fill in the rest of the table
