- Hi, welcome to this question right here.
So, in the following diagram which ishere, the radius of the triangle is 24
centimeters, right? And we know the angleB, D, and C. That's this angle right here,
is 75 degrees. So, we're trying to figureout the angle BAC, which is right over
here. So, that's the missing angle thatyou're trying to figure out, okay?
Now, there's a relationship between thisangle and this angle. Now, the angle 75 is
called the central angle. The centralangle is called the C, for example, okay?
And the inscribed angle of that centralangle is only just half of that, okay? So,
it's equal to the inscribed angle but youneed to put a two times right there, okay?So, basically the central angle is double,
double of the inscribed angle. Now, how doyou know that one is really an inscribed
while the other is the center? Well, thecentral angle is always from a point and
then the other point, and they form withthe center line, okay? The center point,
okay? So, this is your central angle righthere.
Now, if you start and finish with the samepoints, which is B and C, and you form any
triangle around your circle right here,those are called your inscribed angles,
okay? Or they have the same arc lengths.You can actually look at the arc lengths
right here. This is the arc length of thetriangles, right?So, as long as they share the same arc
length. Doesn't have to start from here tohere. It could be somewhere else. As long
as the arc length, the A-R-C, is the same.Therefore, this equation right here will
exist, okay? The central angle is thedouble of the inscribed angle. So, if
that's 75 over here, then, basically it'sjust two times the missing angle. Which
is, let me put down. . .75 degrees and there's your two theta
that's missing, okay? So, just grab yourcalculator and take the 75 divided by two,
you get yourself the angle, which is thisone right here, the BAC will just be 37.5
degrees. And that's your final answer forthis question. Thanks for watching.
