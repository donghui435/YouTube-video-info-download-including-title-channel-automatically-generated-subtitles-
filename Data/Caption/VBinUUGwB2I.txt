hi everyone I'm going to talk about Ycosine it's called the cosine and thisidea is also the same for cosecant andcotangent by the Meuse cosine forillustration and this is how we aregoing to do it first we are going tostart with a right triangle at themutual right triangle this way puttingthe right angle here and then let melabel this and go to be theta and let melabel the sides of the right triangle tobe a b c m first we are going to talkabout what's the cosine theta from thisright triangle well by the finish ofcosine it's the adjacent over thehypotenuse right here is the angle weretalking about theta so that will makethis side to be the adjacent to thetheta so it will be the B and the middlethat right here P will be the adjacentside to the angle theta and then thehypotenuse is the longest side which isthe C right hereso they mean they put that right herefor you guys pama tools so cosine thetafor this right triangle will be B over Cthat's it and then here is the punchlineI'm going to first figure out what thisangle is first well we know that the sumof all the angles in a right trianglehas to be 180 degrees right this isalready 90 degree because this is aright angle this is Theta so how big isthis we'll just do a quick example ifthis is 20 this has to be what symmetryright because 20 degrees plus 90 degreesplus 70 degrees altogether that willgive us the Hossein 180 degrees anotherway to do it is if this is 20 this hasto be 90 minus 20 to be 70 degree well Idon't know how big this is this is justtheta right so I'm going to label thisas 90 degrees minus theta and this willbe an expression for this angle righthere all right so I'm going to focus onthis angle which I'm making red rightI'm going to talk about what's the sineof this angle which is 90 degrees minustheta okay and what's upan inch of sign in a right triangle forsign it's the opposite over thehypotenuse right here is the angle thatwere talking about ninety degrees minustheta the opposite side is that when youhave to go away from this angle so weactually right here this side will bethe opposite side with respect to thisend going red so once they get that's Bat this time this is the apps' asidefrom this angle and then the hypotenuseis the longest side which is this righthere which is the C value again right soan adjustable data step pompidou's andwe know that sine of 90 degrees minustheta which is this angle is theopposite and at B over the hypotenusewhich is the C all rightcan we see any connection now I think soright because here we have the cosinetheta is equal to B over C and on theother hand sine of 90 degrees minustheta is also B over C well that willtell us that these two expressions mustbe equal to each other right becausethey're both equals to B over C so I canwrite down a statement right here cosinetheta has to be the same as sine of 90degrees minus theta and this in fact isone of the identities and now let's talkabout some vocabularies we know that ifwe have two angles they add up to 90degrees then they are calledcomplementary angles well this is angletheta this is angle 90 degree minustheta and we know that if we have theangle theta then 90 degrees minus theangle will be its complementary angleand you see that right here cosine thetais equal to sine of the complementaryangle right and you see that's theconnection cosine it's the sign of itscomplementary angle and let me write itdown here the 90 degree minus thetait's thecomplementary angle all theta andtherefore you see the connection cosineit's called the co-sign and it's alsothe same for cosecant and cotangent andhere are the Co identities that you willsee if you remember the name you'llremember these identities much better Ihope you guys enjoyed this video if youdo please subscribe and then share thisvideo with other people who also enjoymath thank you did
