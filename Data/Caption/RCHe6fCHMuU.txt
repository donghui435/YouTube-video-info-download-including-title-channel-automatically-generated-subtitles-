hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmom of calm in this video we're going tostudy the area of polygons and theprinciple behind finding the area of apolygon is very simple all you do isdivide that into triangles and find thearea of each triangle and then add thoseareas so for example if I have this kindof strange-looking critter I divide itinto triangles by drawing diagonals fromvertex to some other vertex okay and inyour polygon you can always do thatno it's divided into triangles and if wewere to find the area of the polygon wejust find the area of each triangle andthen add all those up now we're notgonna find the area of this polygonthough let's go on and find first areasof these and then that one there'splenty of work there for example here inthe grid I'll first divide this intotriangle so there are several ways youcan do that even okay for example maybeI'll see that if I draw a line here thenit becomes two triangles like the uppertriangle here and the lower one here theupper one okay we better write somethingdown so we don't get confused upper onehas a base of one two three four fourunits and then the altitude is here oneunit four times one is four divided bytwo is two upper triangle is two squareunits lower triangle has the same baseif I take this as my base four and thenthis is my altitude here okay that is 2so 4 times 2 is 8 divided by 2 is 4 okayand now I add 2 plus 4 is 6 total 6square units over here I have 1 2 3 5vertices so it's a Pentagon and I canagain divide it into triangles but beingin the grid I'll show you another methodmethod that I like andis that we will enclose it in arectangle first of all and ultrarectangle here so that as many verticesas possible will be will be touching thesides of that rectangle the idea here isthat it's very easy to calculate thearea of this rectangle and then we willbe left with triangles here that we needto subtract and these triangles here areright triangles and it's very easy tofind the area of a right triangle herein the grid especially so the area of arectangle here is one two three fourfive six units and then one two threefour five minutes that's 30 30 squareunits for the rectangle and then wesubtract from that all these littleareas does this triangle here it's aright triangle see so I choose as itsbase this side and then altitude thisside so I get 3 times 1/2 which is oneand a half okayI've done this one it was one and a half1.5 now this triangle here again it's aright triangle so I can choose altitudehere one and then one two three fourfive units this way five times 1/2 sothis one has the area of two-and-a-halfsquare units - two and a half and thenover hereI have a right triangle two times two isfourthe garbha tool is to the area this oneis two square units- two then over here we have an oddshape but I can divide it into righttriangles and a square the slips righttriangle which is three times 1 so it'sarea is 1 and 1/2 then there's thissquare and then this way is 3 and 1 atriangle so this one has an areaone and a half two and then this one isone more so we subtract from 30 allthese and then we get the area of thisone here inside now do we have here hehas 4 is 3 7 plus 3 is 10 so we subtractthe total 10 square units and the finalanswer is therefore 20 square units niceeven numberI didn't purposefully make it so thishappened to be I really like this methodlet's go on and find the area of thistrapezoid okayI will do it by dividing it into sometriangles and being a trapezoid I willget a rectangle here in the middle so Ishould draw a perpendicular line here sothat I will get my triangle here becausemy protractor doesn't quite reach thereso I have to just kind of eyeball itthis time there and over here too now Ihave two right triangles and then arectangle here in the middle and thenit's time to measure all these thistriangle here has a base of 14 and 1/2centimeters then this rectangle here is30 and this is 8 and 1/2 then I need theheightsomething like that now I'm donemeasuring where to calculate all of thisfirst of all let me just put this istriangle number one this is thinrectangle two and triangle three sowe'll do triangle one first its base isthis fourteen point five centimetersaltitude here and then we need to divideby two so I need to multiply these twonumbers here just a similarmultiplication with times five there nownotice those two decimals here twodecimal digits so the answers have twodecimal digits and then we need to takethat / - that's not done yet to see youmultiply this times this and then divideby two to get the area of a triangle soI'll take half of that which would betwo hundred and twelve point four twofive once I get all these done I'lldefinitely round these numbers okay formy final answers next we'll take therectangle that's easy because you justmultiply this side times this side so wewill have twenty nine point three timesthirty zeros and then over here threetimes three is nine and then need to puta decimal point in my answer this onedecimal digit here so one day two theanswer here is their form 879 squarecentimeters and then a third triangle Imean the third shape the triangle okayagain we need to go base times altitudeand then also / - I will go twenty ninepoint three times eight point fiveagain I have to decimal digits in myfactors so two decimal digits in theanswer 249 I'm sorry but the danger isit is so easy to forget to divide by twonow the answer we need to divide this bytwo I'm gonna erase now we are going todivide this by two so that one cut adecimal here so one hundred twenty fourpoint five two five square centimetersand now we are ready to find the area ofthe whole trapezoid by adding thosethree and then rounding roundingprobably to the nearest ten squarecentimeters okay let me add know they'refive and five all right 1215 point ninefive square centimeters but like I saidit means rounded let's just round it tonearest ten so we will get thousand twohundred twenty square centimeters okaynow the principles are not difficult itis not difficult to figure out okay Ihave a triangle triangle and a rectangleand then I just need to find in thoseindividual areas and add the difficultyin this is actually to keep in keepingtrack of the calculations becausethere's so many to do record yourpartial results to keep track of themokay so you don't get confused in thesemini calculations I hope this washelpful
