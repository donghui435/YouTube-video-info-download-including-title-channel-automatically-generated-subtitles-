all right so another example here ofgraphing a rational function suppose wewant to graph X minus 3 over x squaredminus 9 ok so again let's think aboutthe domain of the function the domain ofthis function x squared minus 9 would beall reals except when basically when theequation x squared minus 9 except forwhen that equals 0 because again wedon't want to divide by 0 so well xsquared minus 9 I could factor that as Xminus 3 X plus 3 equals 0 and our domainwould be all X's except for positive 3and also negative 3 ok notice a couplethings as well notice if we plug 3 backinto our original formula we'll get 0 ontop we also get 0 on the bottom againwhich makes it undefinedbut if we get 0 over 0 remember whatthat means is we just have a hole in ourgraph notice if we plug in negative 3well in the numerator we have negative 3minus 3 which is negative 6 again in thedenominator we get just 0but remember if you get a nonzero numberover 0 that's gonna mean you have avertical asymptote at that pointokay so a couple things I think to keepin mind so there's a hole in the graphat x equals three there's a verticalasymptote at x equals negative 30 noticeour original function two we canactually simplify this down we have Xminus three over x squared minus ninewell the denominator just factors as Xminus three X plus three we could cancelout the X minus threes and we'd be leftwith 1 over X plus 3 so what that tellsme is I'm really graphing the function GI'm graphing the function we'll call itstill G of X 1 over X plus 3 but we alsohave to remember that there's a hole atx equals 3 okayI mean if we just started with thefunction 1 over X plus 3 there would beno problem by putting 3 in we would endup with 1/6 but again we have to takethe original function into account andit would be undefined at 3 so all to meit says it says hey Patrick graph oneover X plus 3 but just remember there'sa hole at this x coordinate of 3 wellremember 1 over X is just kind of ouror function that kind of goes down youknow in the bottom and in the thirdquadrant and it's kind of also hangingout in the first quadrantremember if we replace our X with X plusthree that's going to shift it threeunits to the left and again that's wherewe said our vertical asymptote was wasat negative 30 so there's our verticalasymptoteso let's see G of x equals 1 over X plus3 so again just to figure out the holein the graph I plug 3 into this if iplug 3 in we would get 1 over 6 so 1over 6 we'll say that's right there sothis is the point that's missing fromour graph it would be 3 comma 1/6 butnow it's just got this same basic shapeto it except everything's been shiftedover a little bit let's see if we plug 0in we would get 1/3 which would be alittle higher so obviously it looks alittle looks a little bigger than 1/3here but so not quite to scale butotherwise it has just the same generalshape to it so the graph would go up itwould go through its y-intercept againat this x coordinate of 3 and ay-coordinate of 1/6 we'd have a littleopen circle and then it would still bekind of hanging out in this in thisbottom left region so it would go downto negative infinity and then it wouldlevel out at the x-axis as you move tothe left so again basic idea we justtake 1 over X we just moved it 3 unitsto the left we had to make thisrecognition that there would be a holeat the x coordinate of 3 well if the xcoordinate of 3 what would be the ycoordinate just plug it in make the holethere and then you've got you've gotyour graph
