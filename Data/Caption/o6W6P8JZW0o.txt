So if you're like
me, you probablydon't carry around a
protractor everywhere you go.And even if you
do, sometimes youwant to have only
the angle you want.Because you needed a whole bunch
without all those other degreesgetting in the way.This is the need that the
angle-a-tron fulfills.A protractor is kind of like
a 180-degree angle-a-tron.It's great at 180 degrees.You can make your own 180-degree
angle-a-tron super easilyfrom any piece of paper.Even if your paper doesn't have
an edge, you can just fold it.And tada, angle-a-tron.One extremely
useful angle-a-tronis the 90-degree angle-a-tron.Many pieces of paper come
pre-equipped with one of these.But if they don't,
you can get oneby folding a 180-degree
angle-a-tron in half.Now you can draw all
sorts of rectangly thingsand perpendicularities.Following the
fold-stuff-in-half method,you can get a 45-degree
angle-a-tron pretty easily.Or a 22.5 degrees.Or 11.25, and so on.And you get these
weird looking numbers.But that's only because
we started with somethingarbitrary, like 360 degrees.When really the numbers
we're looking atare 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16,
you know 1/2 to the n.It's not hard to fold
paper into thirds either.Might take a little evening
out, then bam, 180 degreestuns into 60 degrees.Good for making
equilateral triangles.Or put two together
to get 120 degrees.A very common and useful angle
for when, say, bubbles meet.If you're drawing bubbles
or honeycombs or something.Then you can start
adding them together.135 degrees is easy.90 degrees plus 45 degrees.Now, you can make
puzzles for yourself.Say you make a
60-degree angle-a-tronand a 135-degree angle-a-tron.How do you make an angle-a-tron
that completes the circle?Or if a friend gives
you an angle-a-tron,can you make the complementary
or supplementary-- I forgetwhich is which-- angle-a-tron?And then, let me know if this
is going a little too far.Maybe you can put
an angle-a-tronon your angle-a-tron.And now I have a 60 degrees
and another 60 degrees,which comes over here to
make another 60 degrees.And I've got an equilateral
triangle polygon-a-tron.And just in case you thought
that wasn't going too far,why not make that into
a polyhedron-a-tron?
