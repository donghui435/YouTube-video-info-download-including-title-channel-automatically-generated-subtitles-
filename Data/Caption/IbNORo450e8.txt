hi this is Proctor in this video we'regoing to discuss why cherry picking isprobably not a good idea in the NBAwe're going to do a very simplified formof analysis and we're going to make someunrealistic assumptions but they'll begood enough to illustrate the main pointthe average play in the NBA will be inthe halfcourt and it'll have five on theblue team against five on the red teamif the blue team is running the offensein an average manner and the red team isdefending then we're going to say bluescores 45% of the time this is based onthe average field goal percentage in theNBA the strategy of cherry picking saysthat the red team is going to take onedefender and move it all the way to theother basket so this means the blue teamhas a five on four advantage if cherrypicking were to work successfully we canimagine the red team defends just aswell as if they had five players but theadvantage is that if the blue teammisses the red team can heave the ballto the other basket and will score 100percent of the time because the red teamis undefended so in this case blue wouldscore forty five percent of the timewhich is the average red is going toscore 55% because they get all the Bluesmisses so cherry picking might actuallywork as a strategy and this is prettysurprising but why won't you see thiswhat's what could be a problem with itwell we have to use game theory andthink about it strategically so one mainproblem is that the blue team is notgoing to just accept this situation onething the blue team can do is they canreact and they can send a defenderagainst the cherry picker so now sinceboth sides have an even number ofoffensive players and defensive playersthe field goal percentage might go tothe average of 45%another issue is a blue could simplycopy red strategy so this is known as astrategy stealing argument so if blueactually had a disadvantage if it was adisadvantage to be on possession andit'd be on offensethen what blue could do is they couldjust give red the ball and then theycould be the cherry pickers so thisclearly shows that cherry picking cannotbe a dedicated good strategy and it'sunlikely to work as something a teamdoes very regularlyhowever because it's something new Istill would like to see it as a fan andit'd be interesting to see how itactually plays out I hope you like thisvideo please subscribe to my channel Imake videos on math and game theory youcan support me on patreon catch me on myblog mind your decisions on Twitter atpressure Walker and you can my bookslisted on my website
