TONY PADILLA: We're going to
do Buffon's needle trick.So this is named after Georges
Louie Leclerc, and this is amethod that he proposed
for working out pi.So basically he proposed that
you would chuck a bunch ofneedles just randomly
on a floor.You can work out pi
from that, yeah.BRADY HARAN: Go on, then.TONY PADILLA: Due to
the random nature.So anyway, we haven't got
needles, and we're not goingto do it on a floor.We're going to do it on
one of Brady's lovelybrown pieces of paper.And we're going to use matches
instead, because we're cheap.So what we want is we want to
draw some lines on this.So there's one line.And what we want is we want the
gaps between lines to betwo matches long.This is all very approximate.What we're going to do is we're
going to chuck a bunchof matches on this board.So I'll just chuck the first
two completely randomly.We need a lot of matches
for this.If I counted these right,
we should have 163.Let's just spread them out.So hopefully, there should
be 163 matches randomlydistributed around this board.Now, this is what I've gotta do
now, is I'm going to counthow many matches cross a line.OK, so I reckon that one does.So you count, Brady,
that was 1, 2, 3.5, 6, 11, 12.13, 14, 51, and I
think that's it.52.52 matches that cross
the lines.There's 163 in total.Now, let's see.Let's do the following
calculation.So 163 divided by 52
is equal to 3.13.And that's not bad.That's not bad, I'm quite
happy with that.BRADY HARAN: That's
very close.TONY PADILLA: Yeah, yeah.So pi is 3.141.So this is not bad.OK, so why isn't it perfect?Because this is not a
very large sample.Viewers could have a little
go themselves.Just literally play
the same game.If you've got more matches,
that's better.You'll get a better accuracy.There was a mathematician
called Lazarine.He used over 3,000 needles, and
he actually managed to getpi accurate to I think it was
about six decimal places.What we're seeing here is
something is akin to a MonteCarlo simulation.That's what it's called.You basically take
a random sample.The reason you get pie out of
this is it's all to do withthe angle that the match takes
as playing some role here.And of course if you're working
in radians, if you gothrough a full 360 degrees,
well, in radians that's 2 pi.OK, so that's where pi's coming
into this game, andthat's why you can get pi
out of this sort ofsetup, because the angle.So we're going to try and
explain the maths of it now.Let me say, imagine that the
length of the match is l, andthat means that the distance
here is 2l.There's a few things that
play a role here.There's the position of the
center of the match, whichI'll call there.We'll say that's a distance
x from here.And then the other thing that
we're interested in is theangle the match is making.So let's just draw it,
I guess, like so.We're interested in
that angle beta.Assuming everything's
completely random.how do we measure the
probability of where thecenter of the match is?Well, the probability density
of the center of the match,which is position x, is just
given by essentially 1/l.The other thing that we're
interested in isthe angle it makes.So this is sort of a measure
of the probability of theangle it's making.And basically, the angles that
we're interested in aresomewhere between 0 and pi/2
which is of course 90 degrees.This is where the
pi's coming in.Now, if we want to work out
essentially the probabilityfor the match to cross the
line, what we do iswe take these two.We have to do an integration.OK, now there's an important
point here.What's the condition for the
match to cross the line?Well, the condition for the
match to cross the line isthat x should be less
than l/2 sine theta.So that means when we do the x
integration, we go between 0and l/2 sine theta.OK, and of course when we do the
theta integration, we'regoing between 0 and pi by 2.So we do it, theta equals 0,
this is pi/2, 2 over l pi.2 over l pi.When we do the x integration, we
get an l over 2 sine theta.And then we integrate sine theta
between 0 and pi by 2.That gives me 1, and I've
got the 1/pi there, sothe answer is 1/pi.This tells me the probability
that you're going to cross theline, right?So if I've got n matches, and
I want to work out how manycross, let me call them--
so this is the n total.And I want to work out
how many cross.Then I just multiply
and total that.1/pi.So n total is 163.And n crossing was 52, I think
we got, didn't we?OK.So what you see from that
if we've got 163/pi.Let's put an approximate
sign in there.Approximately 52, or if you
like, what we actually saw wasthat pi, just rearrange
this equation, soapproximately 163/52.Yeah, I'm happy with that.Yeah, yeah.That's good.So that's how it works.That's the theory behind it.
