what are some ways to transform onerectangle into another wall preservingarea the simplest method is to cut it inhalf and put the pieces side-by-side butwhat if we want some funkier dimensionstake these two rectangles for example todecompose red into blue we need todetermine the way to dissect or cut thered rectangle start by overlapping thetwo rectangles next draw a line betweenthese two vertices and make a cut alongevery line this creates two pairs ofcongruent triangles the red pair and thepink pair now that we know how to makeour dissection let's see how totransform one rectangle into anotherstart with the red rectangle dissect itusing the lines we just determined slidethe triangles to their new position andvoila we have the blue rectangle sincewe are not adding or removing any piecesthe total area stays the samein fact this strategy works for any tworectangles of equal area let's get evenmore general if you can decompose onepolygon into another with a finitenumber of cuts we say that these twopolygons are equi decomposable in factthe wall espalier Gerwin theorem showsthat any two polygons of equal area areequi decomposable to prove this startwith the fact that every polygon can betriangulated we then turn every triangleinto a rectangle by bisecting it drawingthe altitude and rotating as shown fromhere we use our earlier rectangletransformation to make every rectangleof uniform width when stacked these forma large rectangle with the same area asour original polygon and mostimportantly all of these steps arereversible now consider our targetpolygon using the same technique it canalso be decomposed into a rectangle witha finite number of cuts since bothpolygons are the same area bothrectangles willthe same area now let's see the fullprocess first we decompose the startingpolygon into a rectangle usingtriangulation next we transform it intothe target polygons rectangle finally wereverse the process to create the targetpolygon[Music]while thorough finding an intermediaterectangle is not always the most elegantmethod what if we just want to decomposethis square into an equilateral trianglefor this we only need three cuts this iscalled the du Demi triangle named afterHenry tootanny who discovered it as achallenge from a newspaper puzzle it isa special type of dissection called ahinge dissection where every piece isconnected to at least one other piecewith a hingeeven with this limitation in 2007 a teamshowed that to Ed we decomposablepolygons will always have a hingedissection going between the two thisresult has possible implications forsome fascinating fields such asself-assembling robotics and nanomanufacturing now everyone can getexcited about dissections well almosteveryoneand
