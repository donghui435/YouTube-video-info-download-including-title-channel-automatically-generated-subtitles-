here I have another question of ultimatesequence that often comes this this typeof question in examination where youneed to find out the end and end Tomalright so let's read the question firstif the first term of an automaticsequence is 2 and the common differenceis 8 and the sum of the an Tom's is 90then find the value of the and and enterso as I told you in the previous videosand for many videos I'm telling youalways and always try to write the forus to given things so as per thequestion let's write all the giventhings if the first term all right keepin mind the first term ultimatelysequence is 2 so let me represent thefirst term by a and the first term of anopportunity sequence is 2 here and thecommon difference is 8 common differencewe general represent by D so let's saycommon difference is here it D equals to8 and the sum of the N terms is 90 okaywe are given one more thing the sum of nterms as n is given to be 90 then findthe value of n we need to find out Nequals what and find the value of nthterm that is a N equals to what alrightso these are the given things and as youalready know that after writing thegiven things we have to formulate thegiven given things you know and here youknow the first term is given and thelast term is given and the ant some ofthe anthem is given so it's very easy tonow deal because you know a you know Dand you know you know s n also so simplyformulate the sum of n terms here andput the value of that alright so thegeneral sum of sum of anthems formula isas n equals two you know that it's n by2 twice of a and minus 1 times thecommon difference and here we are giventhat the sum of anthems is 90 so I'mjust going to plug the value of that 90and n terms we need to find out we don'tknow what is the value of n so I'mputting your N by 2 all rightand here to e twice off first term thatis 2 and again n we don't know so let meput n minus 1 and the common differenceI know that's 8 so further I'm going todo and 9 times 2 that's 18 so it's goingto be 180 equals 2n times now 2 times 2that is 4and n minus one that's that eighty isgoing to volley back so it's going to beeight and first a 10-8 okay and bracketclose and further it's going to be 180and now n is going to multiply thisknown for later will multiply firstlet's solve this this is a ten and thisis minus eight all right plus four andminus a that's going to be minus fourall right and now n times I'm dealingthis first right and and we'll multiplythis a ten and you'll get eight andsquare and this n will imply this fouryou'll get four N and let me bring this180 into this side so it's going to beminus 180 and equals to 0 because hereyou'll be left with nothing you'll beleft with zero all right now let's solveit so further I'm bringing a little downso let me take here the common for allright if I'm taking here common for thenI'll get two and square and here it willbe left with simply N and when four willget common from the 180 you'll get here45 and equals to zero all right so nowit's going to be simply 2 n square minusn minus 45 equals to 0 so now we cansolve this by any method there are a lotof methods to solve this quadraticequation I'm just doing middle term issplitting method alright for that I needto multiply 2 and 45 I'll get 90 alrightso the two numbers product you know ifit is a and B then the product of themshould be 90 and the sum you know a plusB should be n is being multiplied byminus 1 so it's minus 1 so we need tosuch two numbers that multiply to 90 andsums to minus 1 and we got that numberthat's 9 and 10I'm in 9 and minus 10 if you add thatyou'll get minus 1 if you multipliedyou'll get 90 no because it is minus 45so it's minus 90 here right - 45 times 2that's minus 90 and we got it so I'mgoing to split this as a 2 n squareminus 10 n plus 9 n minus 45 equals to 0and now further if I am taking here -and common then I'll be left with and- five and here if I'm taking ninecommon then I'll be left with nine minusfive equals to zero so further we aregoing to get 2n plus 9 and n minus 5equals to zero now either 2n plus 9equals to zero or you'll get nine minusfive equals to zero and now let me tellyou here you'll get 2n equals to 9 minus9 and n equals to minus 9 by 2 and ncannot have the negative numbers or notpossible this is not possible reason whyit's not possible and cannot havenegative number you know you have towrite it here and can't be negative andcan't be negative and fraction can't bean agreement fraction and is a integeryou know can't be negative and fractionand fraction so therefore N equals 2/5so you got the value of M you know yougot the value of M now so the questionwas asking what is the value of N andnow we are saying the question hey thevalue of n is 5 okay let's find the nthterm it means a 5 we need to find outwhat is the fifth term so 5th um fromthe general term formula that's a plusand minus 1 times D or you are wellenough and well learned then you cansimply write a plus 40 because wheneveryou're writing any term and the termyou're writing then it becomes n minus 1so if you're adding 5 term here then itwill be 4 times D all right okay so it'sfirst time first time we know alreadythat is 2 all right I'm not lying youknow that you know it's 2 and of commondifference is 8 so let's put the well ofcommon difference that's 4 times 8 andthat's 2 plus 4 times 8 that is 32 andthat's going to be 34 answer so ourfifth term is 34 I hope you understandthis and similar of the question you alot you need to do always always alwaysyou know keep just one thing in mindright all the given things first that'syour first step and the second step itformulated given things first you writeand the second step it formulatedformulated and after formulating ityou'll get the non you'll get someunknown quantity get the value get downon value you knowthe unknown value here done on valuethat's a third state and the fourthstate get the desire get the desire getthe question what do you ask get thedesire one okay so first what we did wewrite the given things here and then weformulate it here whatever we are givenfrom them we are given this and weformulate it and then we get the valueof unknown value and unknown was G and Nand we got here and you know see we gotthe value of N and our fourth step isnow got the desired value you know getthe desired value get the desired onethe question was asking us and we findout and we need to find out our desirewe're desiring to get a n that is 1/5umm and we find out that's going to be34 this is how we need to solve the anytype of the problem insert medicsequence of progression whatever you sayalright anomaly here in the geometricsequence or harmonic sequence they'realso the same methods applies all rightsee you in the next video with nexttypical question that's definitely goingto help you catch you in the next videogoodbye and please don't forget tosubscribe the channel and hit the likebutton
