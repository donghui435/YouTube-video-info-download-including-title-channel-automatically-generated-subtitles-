Okay, hours of fun to be had
working out codes in two-one machinesand three-one machines and so on.In fact I had another flash of insight
after that because I realizedI could also do a four-one machine
or a five-one machine or a six-one machine.Crazy!So what I want to do now
is be extra crazyand go all the way up to something wild
like a ten-one machine.In fact, lets be insane.Let's put in 273 dots in a ten-one machine.What's the code for this number
going to be in this machine?Wild.All right, first off, let me draw 273 dots.One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten¡ªAlways the right most box remember.Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen¡ªAll right, I guess I'm going to be here a while.Dah dah dah dah dah...273 dots.Dah dah dah...am I there yet?[tap tap tap on the board]Okay, I'm getting bored,
is that close enough?Close enough, we'll say that's 273 dots.Brilliant.All right, so I need to think my way
through this slowly.I'm a little bit slow on these things
so here goes.First question, its just a yes/no question.Will there be any explosions?Well, yes, there will be explosions.In fact, how many explosions will there be
among 273 dots?Well, each group of ten explodes, I guess that makes what,
twenty-seven explosions will occur?And, any dots left behind?Uh, yes, I bet three dots will be left behind.All right, so let's do that.Let's do twenty-seven explosions,
Ka-boom, ka-thwow, ka-thwack,twenty-seven times.Oh-oh, so if twenty-seven explosions
how many dots will appear here?Well, each explosion makes a dot
so I guess that makes twenty-seven dots here.Um, can I just write twenty-seven
rather than draw the dots?Is that okay?All right, so twenty-seven explosions
makes twenty-seven dots in the next box overleaving what we said three behind.Grand.Next questions, will there be
any more explosions?Why yes, I bet there's what, two more explosions,
leaving how many dots behind?Probably seven behind.All right, two more explosions,
ka-boom, ka-dot, and then seven behind.Oh, oh, look what we've got.So what's the secret code for the number 273
in a ten-one machine?It's two, seven, three.Whoa.What's going on?These machines are obviously doing something.In fact, you might already know
what they're doing.You might be cleverer than me.But that's a good question,
what are these machines actually doing?The code for 273 in a ten-one machine
is surprisingly 273.That's our next job.Let's figure out what these machines
are actually doing.Wow, that's going to be cool.
