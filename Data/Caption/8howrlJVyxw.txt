remember to stop on over at mashup mathcomm to download the free guide thataccompanies this lesson in this lessonwe're going to focus on parent functionsbehind all the functions we know is aparent function and if we understandthat parent function we can betterunderstand how functions transform inthe coordinate planewe'll start off with the constantfunction f of X equals K where K is justsome real number in this case K equals 5for the equation y equals 5 which is ahorizontal line now the domain for thisfunction is gonna be all the values fromnegative infinity to positive infinityand the range of this function is justgoing to be the value K in this case 5the next parent function is the linearfunction f of x equals x this is adiagonal line with a slope of 1 and ay-intercept of 0 we can see that thedomain and range of the linear functionis going to be all values from negativeinfinity to positive infinity if we wereto for example shift this linearfunction up four units the new equationwould be y equals x plus 4 however thedomain range would still remain the sameour next parent function is the absolutevalue function f of x equals theabsolute value of x we know thatabsolute value is always positive thathelps us to understand why this parentfunction remains above the x-axis andwhy the domain is negative infinity topositive infinity but the range startsat 0 and moves up to positive infinitybut again is never negativelet's see what happens if we take thisfunction and shift it to the left 5units and then down 4 unitswe can see that the parent function wastransformed and moved to a new locationand we can also see how this newequation reflects that transformationfor this particular shift we can see howthe domain remain the same but the rangehas to be adjusted now instead of zeroto infinity we have negative and four toinfinity the next parent function is thequadratic function f of x equals xsquared this parabola should look veryfamiliar to us if we compare it to theabsolute value function we can clearlysee that it has the same domain andrange the domain being negative infinityto positive infinity and the range beingfrom 0 to infinity let's go ahead andtransform this function by shifting itto the right 6 units and then up 3 unitsthis new equation reflects thetransformation on the parent function yequals x squared and we can see how thedomain would stay the same but the rangewould need to be adjusted from 0 toinfinity to 3 to infinity the nextparent function is the square rootfunction f of x equals the square rootof xthis function has both a domain andrange of from zero to positive infinitynow if we were to multiply this parentfunction by a factor of three we wouldhave a new graph to represent y equalsthree times the square root of x but wecan still see that the domain and rangewould remain the same our last parentfunction is the O so strange inversefunction f of x equals 1 over X noticethat there is a vertical asymptote at 0so the domain for this function is goingto be all real numbers except for 0 Xcannot equal 0there is also a horizontal asymptote aty equals zero so the range of thisfunction is all real numbers except thatY cannot equal zero these asymptotesoccur because we know that we cannothave zero in the denominator so X cannever equal zero if we transform thisparent function by shifting it up twounits on the y-axis we have a newequation y equals 1 over X plus 2notice that the location of our verticalasymptote at x equals 0 did not changeso the domain will not changenotice however that our horizontalasymptote has shifted up and now existsat y equals two so the new domain willbe all real numbers except for twoplease follow us on Instagram and mashupmath for free daily math tipsinfographics
