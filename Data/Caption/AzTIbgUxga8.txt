welcome here's the fun result attributedto Viviani a latest earth 13th centuryItalian mathematician he names thefollowing if you take an equilateraltriangle and then choose any point youlike inside the triangle let's call it Pand measure its three perpendicular tothe distances to the sides of hisdistance a to the bottom side hisdistance B to the left side and hisdistance C to the right side and thevalue a plus B let's see the similarthree distances he claims will always bethe same matter which point you chooseinside the triangle which was point overhere these three distances a plus B thesame is the same value as the previouscase did over here and so on but itstill bit further since this distancethis sum is always equal to the heightof the triangle those Viviani through webriefly prove why that's true and thenwe'll talk about some fungeneralizations okay he goes why is thispossibly true well let's take a point Pand whoops is vomiting and I use it tocalculate the area of the triangle andI'll do it the following way is myoriginal point P and I'll use a messydiagram here let's assume my ¨¦clairs atriangle has side length x and let'scall the height of the triangle H ofcourse I could work about eight years interms of exponents leave it like thatfor the moment all right one way to workit near the triangle is to divide thetriangle to three pieces as followsoops very funky little pieces there theshade of triangle has bait X and heightA's it's area is half a X this secondpiece here has base X and height C halfC X and this remaining piece is mainlytriangle here's base x height B half B Xso the area of the triangle is 1/2 axplus 1/2 B X plus 1/2 C X or I couldhave worked at the ear the trianglepunch looking at the whole thing thewhole triangle has base X and height Hso it's also 1/2 X and H well what arethe ears into it's in area in twodifferent ways this must be equal thisequality is valid I multiply through by2 divided by X I'm left with a plus Bplus C must be the height of thetriangle no matter where this point P isinitially located inside the trianglegrand well it sort of fun thing I liketo do is ask why do we need to stickthe triangle what we let the point Pwander outside wouldn't that just bedevilish of us let's do itso here's my ecological triangle againand suppose this time we chose the pointP to say lie over here we still measurethe three perpendicular distances is thebottom one at the first side let'slength a is the one to length B atlength B to the left side and the heightto the distance of length is the thirdside to see I claim no matter where B isP is placed a plus B minus C now it wasthe height of the triangle well I saidno matter where it supposed to be alittle bit careful first of all youactually follow exactly the same proofas before we can work at the area twotriangle two different ways I'll do thesame trick I could work at the area ofthis piece half X 1/2 base times heightis a I could work at the area of thispiece plus 1/2 base x height B but I'veovershot the area by this amount so Ineed to subtract half x times C and thatwould be the area of the triangle 1/2 XH well there we areso if I allow myself to subtract areas Ican actually generalize resort to getthat at least for some region outsidethe triangle this is a constant value 8/ speed - season the height of thetriangle well let me be little moreprecisely of what I mean by whereaboutsoutside the triangle I can go what Ineed to do and I'll leave it to you toverify the details if I can synthesizethe triangles as a following there's oneside here's the second side and here'sthe third side we showed in the middleof the triangle a plus B plus C isconstant over here a plus B minus C isconstant I claimed over here a minus Bplus C is constant and in this region aplus B minus C is a constant and in oneof these regions like this one I claimednegative a plus B minus C is constantthen I'll leave it for you to figurewhat's going on here and what's goinghere but you can guess it's going to beone positive and two negative so thereis there's there's Viviana's theoremtaking outside the triangle and I'llgive you additional piece of homeworkwho statistic with equilateral triangleswhat's the version Viviani theorem for aseguir but take a point inside thesquare I guess it's kind of obvious thatit's for perpendicular distances a plusB plus C plus D is going to be constantboth well at this point wanted outsidethe square although work with a regularpentagon or regular hexagon or a regularn-gon of any size value n what's theperfect generalization to viennesetheorem well that sounds like a lot offun all right thanks very much
