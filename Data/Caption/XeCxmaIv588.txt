[Music]hey I go fishing today we'll be workingon polynomials location so if youhaven't seen our little base to base 3videos of multiplication I shouldprobably go back and watch those thelink has got being right now alright solet's get into the videoOh recommend we are in a big blue redface X machine this column over here isthe one column as you could affect andthis is the X column departure from youx squared X cubed x to the fourthexercise in the exp so we got dot herein the latyou know in deduct enjoyed and we weresaying that you can topple it's a lightblue small like blue ones or the antidots and the bigger dog learns all duckswe have multiple types of dr. Nasir arebecause we might be what I what we arereplaced in what we are we are X plus 1and X plus 2 now they're moving them theparty one on the bottom go to with itdot on top probe into the exact Cardinalis on the bottomand we can do it to get into the subtlegot an we got itso Xbox one times X X plus 2 equals Hreal plus 3x plus 2 all right so here wehave X minus 1 and X plus 2now let's go upall right here a morsel at night 1 timesX plus 2 it will ask where older withbut we're not done yetwe have a dot in India dancing rocks anda diner in tick-tock when they're on thesame box they wear well as a peelthere we go all right so X minus 1 timesX plus 2 equals x foil process - oohoh I'm gonna lure example this one'sgoing to me as my quantum pace we got Xminus 1 now x squared minus 2x minus 3let's do some information alright sohere we go with a battle on bottom andin place one down on the top of it butwhat are we going to do now how do youdo with the negatives so what's theoffice of excellence want but I'llnecklace X plus which would be this nowlet's start walkingso regarding energy doc does appeal andwe have location in it doesn't feelenergy Leroy Ansel X minus one times Xsquare into minus f2 X minus 3 equals xcubed minus 3x squared minus X plus 3all right so another fun video for me Ihope it was just as fun and even thoughsome for you guys so by Illinois'sremember to try this at home
