by now all of us know how to find thecube of a number so 3 when cubed givesus 27it means 3 x 3 x 3 equals 27 so what isa cube root well the cube root of 27 is3 that's all this is the most importantconcept of cube roots the rest of thevideo will just focus on how cube rootsare denoted and its application soremember 3 cubed is 27 and cube root of27 is 3 well this is how the symbol of acube root looks like a root sign with a3 here so we can say that the cube rootof 27 is 3 and as we saw in the squareroot video this root sign is called aradical and the number inside it iscalled the radicand or the base here's abetter way to understand the concept ofcubes 4 cubed equals 4 times 4 times 4which equals 64 we all know this this 3when taken to the other side becomescube root hence we can say that the cuberoot of 64 equals 4 now we're on our wayto understand a very interesting conceptwe will try to understand this conceptwith just one example we know that cuberoot of 64 is 4 this example looks verysimple but modifying it slightly canmake it interesting let's play withthese numbers we can write 64 as 2raised to 6hence cube root of 64 can be written ascube root of 2 raised to 6 we can alsowrite 64 as 4 cubedhence we write this as cube root of 4cubed now let's try writing 4 in anexponential form 4 can be written as 2squaredhence this would equal 2 squared and ofcourse it canalso be written as 4 raised to 1 what dowe observe yes when we take a cube rootof a number in exponential form the baseremains the same and the exponent isdivided by 3 6 became 2 & 3 became 1remember when we take a cube root of anumber in exponential form we shouldkeep the base same and divide theexponent by 3 let's quickly look at acouple of examples say we want to findthe cube root of 4 raised to 9 the baseactually equals 262,000 144 imaginefinding the cube root of this big numberbut using our technique all we need todo is keep the base same and divide theexponent by 3 here the base is 4 hencewe write a 4 here and divide 9 by 3hence we get the cube root of 4 raisedto 9 as 4 raised to 3 now let's tryfinding the cube root of 7 raised to 6we can write it as 7 raised to 6 by 3which equals 7 raised to 2 so rememberkeep the base same and divide theexponent by 3 in the coming videos wewill see how we can calculate the cuberoot of large numbers which are not inexponential form
