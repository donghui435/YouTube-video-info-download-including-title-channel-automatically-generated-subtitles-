welcomemany people know various divisibilityrules for numbers like three and fourand five and nine and eleven and soforthin fact I in this particular volume hereI think is chapter four or five or so mygrowth through various diversity rulesand I'm often asked is there a rule forthe number seven as wellthere is and it's somewhat unusual andwhat I'll do here is I'll explain theball with a couple of examples first andthen we'll get to the interestingquestion why does this bizarre warmabout to demonstrate actually work allright he goes to an example suppose Ipresented the number 1 million ninehundred forty thousand three hundred andseventy two and I'm wondering is that amortal of seven here's how the rule goesthe rule says delete the last digitgiver the two but double it double twois four and subtract that from whatremainsso one nine 403 seven minus four is nowone nine four OH three three and askedinstead is that the multiple seven Ican't tellso I'm gonna use the rule again the rulesays delete the last digit this casethree doublet six and subtraction whatremains one nine four three text six isthree nine seven and now as I said isthat a more plus seven can tell deletethe last digit double it and subtractone nine two five is one nine two fiveimmortal seven can tell delete the lastdigit double it is 10 and subtract one Htwo running out of room now ask is oneage two or more plus seven I can't tellI'll follow the rule yet again deletethe last digit double itthat's four subtract is 14 to squeakingon the page and ask is that the multiple7 or 14 I recognizes yes and apparentlymy rule claims that means the originalnumber must be the multiple seven aswell let's do another example it's asmall on this time 562 is that amultiple seven my rule says delete thelast digit goodbye to double it for andsubtract from what remains and ask is 52instead a multiple of seven I know it'snot but just just demonstrate the ruleone more timedelete the last digit double it andsubtract I got one this time that isdefinitely not immortal seven and theraw parent says that means that wouldnumber was not a lot 7 as well okaythat's that's a curious rule why does itworkokay the proof is listed grow intoabstract ROM now the fact that it relieson the following fact that any numbercan be written if I'm given some numbera n as ten times something plus asingle-digit for example my originalnumber here can be written as ten times1/9 403 seven plus a single-digit of twoso we're asking is a number of this forma multiple of seven I'm gonna dosomething very sneaky bizarre is goingto come out of thin air for the momentbut it all makes sensesurely working with ten a plus B andasking is that multiple seven is nodifferent for asking whether ten a plusB minus twenty one B is a multiple sevenwell I've done here is inserted a termwhich is already multiple seven so thisis not going to affect my disabilitydivisibility question if this wholething is multiple seven it must bebecause the part I'm interested in is amultiple seven now why am i doing thatlet's look at the outer that follows 10aplus V Mars 21 B is the same as 10 aminus 20 B common factor of 10 ten timesa minus 2 B now the wonderful thingabout primes is that they have theproperty that if a prime goes into aproduct it means it goes into one of theindividual terms for example 7 if itgoes into product 10 times a Myers to bethe 7 will never be split apart to gointo partly 10 apart in the second arethat goes at a 10 or goes into thesecond term well actually 7 doesn't gointo 10 so if I'm asking for divisibleby 7 the only way this term could be amultiple of 7 as if this part of theproduct is a multiple of 7 so I'vereally converted my divisible questionsinto the ones of follows for one left anumber n 10 a plus B is more for sevenI'm saying focus instead on this guy aminus 2b but what is that well a iseverything but to the last digit here'sa and what I'm doing to it is attractingtwice that last digit so they asked werethe original numbers of multiple sevenit's clear from the algebra now and Marswill ask is the number for the lastdigit removed but that last digitdoubled the multiple seven instead therewe arein fact this trick is wonderful andallows you to create divisibility rulesfor all sorts of numbers for examplehere is a very strange to visibly rulefor the number 13 I claimed delete thelast digit and add four times whatremains to it as a very sort of strangeand simple example suppose I was askingif 1313 is a multiple thirteen deletethe last digit and add four times it soadd twelve makes 1 for 3 and then ask isthat a mobile 13 suppose I can't telldelete the last digit every three againadd four times it I'm now left with 26and I'm gonna ask is that a multiple of13 well 26 is that means it wasn'tbeginning why is this rule work wellwhat I'm really doing is looking at anumber any number can written is tentimes something plus a single digit andI'm gonna add to this 39 be that weren'teffect whether my original number isdivisible by 13 or not that's alreadymore than 13 I'm still focusing on thedivisibility of this guy but algebrashows this is 10 times a + 4 B thereforedivisible by 13 really depends on thediversity of the second term the numberof the last digit removed plus 4 timesthat last digit so there you go create adivisibility rule for the number 31create disability rule for number 19we've got much power at your hands nowthanks very much
