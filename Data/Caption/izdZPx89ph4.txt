this idea of a nerd-off number this cameup after he passed away today after youknow before he knew about it yeah yeahhe even kind of promoted he said and afundamental problem in mathematics akind of a joke to see you connect topeople if they have a joint paper andthis is like constructing a graph wherethe points are the people that you putan edge if they have a joint paper hecared a lot about collaboration andjoint papers and joint work and so hehad a lot of co-authors he had a theoryand not a real theory that if he hadmore living co-authors than deadco-authors he'd be okay you see somehowas soon as the number of dead onesstarted you know overwhelming the livingwas that he knows his time is coming tooevery day she had another variation ifyou have n papers with him you alreadyshe never should be one over n it'sclose to zero so mines 1 over 27 or 28something like that but there are peoplehave about 60 papers so but you know itisn't always just a number under y oudoesn't have that many papers and stillpretty well known write it so her inmathematics there are more I think it'sprobably true in a lot of fields but Iknow about the math people publish underpseudonyms ok so here's an air dishnumber story of a pseudonym so there wasa paper they were working on air dishand my wife and Chun and some others arekleitman at MIT and there was a fiveauthor paper as a small result wasn't abig thing so we thought why not take theinitials of the authors and make a nameturns out gee Peck Gregory Peck perfectokay gee Peck I was going to G Peck thenright at the endanother mathematician Doug Westcontributed made it simpler better okaywell G W Peck I'll get GW Peck why notokay so we published under GW Peckthat's good turns out that that I had aninteresting concept and people kind ofpicked up on the concept on our starterset it's called post sets and there werePeck post sets and in particularkleitman as a professor Dan kleitman atMITI like the name so much he startedpublishing a few small papers under thename GW Peck MIT well the mathematicalreviews sent letters to MIT JeffPACA said we've noticed you're publishedin this area would you like to reviewfor us and Peck said sure so Peckstarted reviewing papers and he reviewedone of Lightman's papers which is alittle incestuous he was the game GeorgePurdy at Cincinnati I'm the G C wasChung fan chunk a was kleitman he wasair dish it's good to have a vowel wellit turns out that Doug West never had apaper with air dish but it was only thisand Jerry Griggs was anothermathematician had a paper with Doug Westbut he never had a paper with air dishso his artist number is one plus I the Iis the imaginary and in the complexplane that's one plus I that's closerthan distance - so it's an air dishnumber kind of an imaginary because it'san imaginary of course in this paper GWPeck thanks all of us for proving thetheorems writing the paper and so therethere are a number of papers like thisthat you'd never know unless you knowyou know like a nilly a nilly is thedaughter of no got along and she'spublished like I know a dozen paper shecould probably get a pretty good jobsomeplace that's just that's a littlethrowaway result you put it in ain't noa so yeah GW Peck so they had a areunion kleitman retired they had totalk by GW Peck I'm supposed to come butI couldn't come I think Doug West gave awhole history turns that GW Peck was areal person George Washington Peck was apolitician Wisconsin and he has oldhistory and you can find so it turns outit was a real person that's it you neverknow there is just a small postscript tothis story a number of years later DougWest did write a paper with ear - usingtheir real names taking his Oh - numbertwo one and for Jerry Griggs that meanthis Erdos number became to sort offurther away from her - in some respectsI guess thank you to everyone who issupporting numberphile on patreonespecially these people and also ifyou'd like to get this new numberphileposter check out the links on the screenand in the video description the postersby artist Pete McPartlin and full of allsorts of little details and gems fromnumberphile
