 The circle is arguably the most
fundamental shape in ouruniverse, whether you look at
the shapes of orbits ofplanets, whether you look at
wheels, whether you look atthings on kind of a
molecular level.The circle just keeps
showing up over andover and over again.So it's probably worthwhile for
us to understand some of theproperties of the circle.So the first thing when people
kind of discovered the circle,and you just have a look at the
moon to see a circle, but thefirst time they said well, what
are the propertiesof any circle?So the first one they might
want to say is well, a circleis all of the points that are
equal distant from thecenter of the circle.All of these points along the
edge are equal distant fromthat center right there.So one of the first things
someone might want to ask iswhat is that distance, that
equal distance that everythingis from the center?Right there.We call that the
radius of the circle.It's just the distance from
the center out to the edge.If that radius is 3
centimeters, then this radiusis going to be 3 centimeters.And this radius is going
to be 3 centimeters.It's never going to change.By definition, a circle is all
of the points that are equaldistant from the center point.And that distance
is the radius.Now the next most interesting
thing about that, people mightsay well, how fat
is the circle?How wide is it along
its widest point?Or if you just want to cut it
along its widest point, whatis that distance right there?And it doesn't have to be just
right there, I could have justas easily cut it along its
widest point right there.I just wouldn't be cutting it
like some place like thatbecause that wouldn't be
along its widest point.There's multiple places
where I could cut italong its widest point.Well, we just saw the radius
and we see that widest pointgoes through the center
and just keeps going.So it's essentially two radii.You got one radius there
and then you have anotherradius over there.We call this distance along
the widest point of thecircle, the diameter.So that is the diameter
of the circle.It has a very easy
relationship with the radius.The diameter is equal to
two times the radius. Now, the next most interesting
thing that you might bewondering about a circle is how
far is it around the circle?So if you were to get your tape
measure out and you were tomeasure around the circle like
that, what's that distance?We call that word the
circumference of the circle.Now, we know how the diameter
and the radius relates, but howdoes the circumference relate
to, say, the diameter.And if you're not really used
to the diameter, it's veryeasy to figure out how it
relates to the radius.Well, many thousands of years
ago, people took their tapemeasures out and they keep
measuring circumferencesand radiuses.And let's say when their tape
measures weren't so good,let's say they measured the
circumference of the circleand they would get well, it
looks like it's about 3.And then they measure the
radius of the circle right hereor the diameter of that circle,
and they'd say oh, the diameterlooks like it's about 1.So they would say -- let
me write this down.So we're worried about
the ratio -- let mewrite it like this.The ratio of the circumference
to the diameter. So let's say that somebody had
some circle over here -- let'ssay they had this circle, and
the first time with not thatgood of a tape measure, they
measured around the circleand they said hey, it's
roughly equal to 3 meterswhen I go around it.And when I measure the
diameter of the circle,it's roughly equal to 1.OK, that's interesting.Maybe the ratio of
the circumference ofthe diameter's 3.So maybe the circumference
is always threetimes the diameter.Well that was just for this
circle, but let's say theymeasured some other
circle here.It's like this -- I
drew it smaller.Let's say that on this circle
they measured around it andthey found out that the
circumference is 6 centimeters,roughly -- we have a bad
tape measure right then.Then they find out
that the diameter isroughly 2 centimeters.And once again, the ratio of
the circumference of thediameter was roughly 3.OK, this is a neat
property of circles.Maybe the ratio of the
circumference to the diametersalways fixed for any circle.So they said let me
study this further.So they got better
tape measures.When they got better tape
measures, they measured hey,my diameter's definitely 1.They say my diameter's
definitely 1, but when Imeasure my circumference
a little bit, I realizeit's closer to 3.1. And the same thing
with this over here.They notice that this
ratio is closer to 3.1.Then they kept measuring it
better and better and better,and then they realized that
they were getting this number,they just kept measuring it
better and better and they weregetting this number 3.14159.And they just kept adding
digits and it wouldnever repeat.It was a strange fascinating
metaphysical numberthat kept showing up.So since this number was so
fundamental to our universe,because the circle is so
fundamental to our universe,and it just showed up
for every circle.The ratio of the circumference
of the diameter was thiskind of magical number,
they gave it a name.They called it pi, or you could
just give it the Latin or theGreek letter pi --
just like that.That represents this number
which is arguably the mostfascinating number
in our universe.It first shows up as the ratio
of the circumference to thediameter, but you're going to
learn as you go through yourmathematical journey, that
it shows up everywhere.It's one of these fundamental
things about the universe thatjust makes you think that
there's some order to it.But anyway, how can we
use this in I guessour basic mathematics?So we know, or I'm telling you,
that the ratio of thecircumference to the diameter
-- when I say the ratio,literally I'm just saying if
you divide the circumference bythe diameter, you're
going to get pi.Pi is just this number.I could write 3.14159 and just
keep going on and on and on,but that would be a waste of
space and it would just be hardto deal with, so people just
write this Greekletter pi there.So, how can we relate this?We can multiply both sides of
this by the diameter and wecould say that the
circumference is equal to pitimes the diameter.Or since the diameter is equal
to 2 times the radius, we couldsay that the circumference is
equal to pi times 2times the radius.Or the form that you're
most likely to see it,it's equal to 2 pi r.So let's see if we can apply
that to some problems.So let's say I have a circle
just like that, and I were totell you it has a radius --
it's radius right there is 3.So, 3 -- let me write this down
-- so the radius is equal to 3.Maybe it's 3 meters --
put some units in there.What is the circumference
of the circle?The circumference is equal to
2 times pi times the radius.So it's going to be equal to 2
times pi times the radius,times 3 meters, which is
equal to 6 meters timespi or 6 pi meters.6 pi meters.Now I could multiply this out.Remember pi is just a number.Pi is 3.14159 going
on and on and on.So if I multiply 6 times that,
maybe I'll get 18 pointsomething something something.If you have your calculator you
might want to do it, but forsimplicity people just tend to
leave our numbersin terms of pi.Now I don't know what this is
if you multiply 6 times3.14159, I don't know if you
get something close to 19 or18, maybe it's approximately
18 point somethingsomething something.I don't have my calculator
in front of me.But instead of writing
that number, you justwrite 6 pi there.Actually, I think it
wouldn't quite cross thethreshold to 19 yet.Now, let's ask
another question.What is the diameter
of the circle? Well if this radius is 3, the
diameter is just twice that.So it's just going to be 3
times 2 or 3 plus 3, whichis equal to 6 meters.So the circumference is 6 pi
meters, the diameter is 6meters, the radius is 3 meters.Now let's go the other way.Let's say I have
another circle.Let's say I have
another circle here.And I were to tell you that
its circumference is equalto 10 meters -- that's the
circumference of the circle.If you were to put a tape
measure to go around it andsomeone were to ask you what is
the diameter of the circle?Well, we know that the diameter
times pi, we know that pi timesthe diameter is equal to
the circumference; isequal to 10 meters.So to solve for this we would
just divide both sidesof this equation by pi.The diameter would equal
10 meters over pi or10 over pi meters.And that is just a number.If you have your calculator,
you could actually divide 10divided by 3.14159, you're
going to get 3 point somethingsomething something meters.I can't do it in my head.But this is just a number.But for simplicity we often
just leave it that way.Now what is the radius?Well, the radius is equal
to 1/2 the diameter.So this whole distance right
here is 10 over pi meters.If we just 1/2 of that, if
we just want the radius, wejust multiply it times 1/2.So you have 1/2 times 10 over
pi, which is equal to 1/2 times10, or you just divide the
numerator and thedenominator by 2.You get 5 there, so
you get 5 over pi.So the radius over
here is 5 over pi.Nothing super fancy about this.I think the thing that confuses
people the most is to justrealize that pi is a number.Pi is just 3.14159 and it just
keeps going on and on and on.There's actually thousands of
books written about pi, soit's not like -- I don't know
if there's thousands, I'mexaggerating, but you could
write books about this number.But it's just a number.It's a very special number, and
if you wanted to write it in away that you're used to writing
numbers, you could literallyjust multiply this out.But most the time people just
realize they like leavingthings in terms of pi.Anyway, I'll leave you there.In the next video we'll figure
out the area of a circle.
