Use completing the square
to find the roots of thequadratic equation right here.And when anyone talks about
roots, this just means findthe x's where y is equal to 0.That's what a root is.A root is an x value that will
make this quadratic functionequal 0, that will
make y equal 0.So to find the x's, let's
just make y equal 0 andthen solve for x.So we get 0 is equal to 4x
squared plus 40x, plus 280.Now, the first step that we
might want to do, just becauseit looks like all three of these
terms are divisible by4, is just divide both sides
of this equation by 4.That'll make our math a
little bit simpler.So let's just divide everything
by 4 here.If we just divide everything by
4, we get 0 is equal to xsquared plus 10x, plus-- 280
divided by 4 is 70-- plus 70.Now, they say use completing the
square, and actually, letme write that 70 a little bit
further out, and you'll seewhy I did that in a second.So let me just write a plus 70
over here, just to have kindof an awkward space here.And you'll see what I'm about
to do with this space, thathas everything to do with
completing the square.So they say use completing the
square, which means, turnthis, if you can, into
a perfect square.Turn at least part of this
expression into a perfectsquare, and then we can use that
to actually solve for x.So how do we turn this into
a perfect square?Well, we have a 10x here.And we know that we can turn
this into a perfect squaretrinomial if we take 1/2 of the
10, which is 5, and thenwe square that.So 1/2 of 10 is 5, you square
it, you add a 25.Now, you can't just willy-nilly
add a 25 to oneside of the equation without
doing something to the other,or without just subtracting
the 25 right here.Right?Think about it, I have not
changed the equation.I've added 25 and I've
subtracted 25.So I've added nothing to
the right-hand side.I could add a billion and
subtract a billion and notchange the equation.So I have not changed the
equation at all right here.But what I have done is I've
made it possible to expressthese three terms as
a perfect square.That right there,
2 times 5 is 10.5 squared is 25.So that is x plus 5 squared.And if you don't believe
me, multiply it out.You're going to have an x
squared plus 5x, plus 5x,which will give you 10x, plus
5 squared, which is 25.So those first three terms
become that, and then thesecond two terms, right there,
you just add them.Let's see, negative
25 plus 70.Let's see, negative 20 plus 70
would be positive 50, and thenyou have another 5,
so it's plus 45.So we've just algebraically
manipulated this equation.And we get 0 is equal to x
plus 5 squared, plus 45.Now, we could've, from the
beginning if we wanted, wecould've tried to factor it.But what we're going to do here,
this will always work.Even if you have crazy decimal
numbers here, you can solvefor x using the method
we're doing here,completing the square.So to solve for x, let's just
subtract 45 from both sides ofthis equation.And so the left-hand side of
this equation becomes negative45, and the right-hand
side will be justthe x plus 5 squared.These guys, right here,
cancel out.Now, normally if I look at
something like this I'll say,OK, let's just take the
square root of bothsides of this equation.And so you might be tempted to
take the square root of bothsides of this equation, but
immediately when you do that,you'll notice something
strange.We're trying to take
the square rootof a negative number.And if we're dealing with real
numbers, which is everythingwe've dealt with so far, you
can't take a square root of anegative number.There is no real number that if
you square it will give youa negative number.So it's not possible-- I don't
care what you make x-- it isnot possible to add x to
5 and square it, andget a negative number.So there is no x that can
satisfy-- if we assume that isx is a real number-- that can
satisfy this equation.Because I don't care what x you
put here, what real x youput here, you add 5 to it, you
square it, there's no wayyou're going to get
a negative number.So there's no x that can satisfy
this equation, so wecould say there are no-- and
I'm using the word realbecause in Algebra 2 you'll
learn that there are thingscalled complex numbers, but
don't worry about that rightnow-- but there no real roots
to the quadratic equation.And we're done.And actually, if you had tried
to factor it, you would havefound it very difficult,
because this is not afactorable expression right
here, and you know it becausethere's no real roots.
