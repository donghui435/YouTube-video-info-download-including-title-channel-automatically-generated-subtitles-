DR. .JAMES GRIME: So today we're
going to talk about oneof the great unsolved problems
in mathematics that went backto the Ancient Greeks, thousands
of years ago, whichwas eventually solved in 1882.And the problem is called
squaring the circle.And you may have even heard of
the problem as a metaphor forsomething that's impossible
to do.The question is, can you make a
square with the same area asthe circle?Now you have to understand
the rules.In Ancient Greece they
didn't have algebra.So they could only
construct numbersusing lines and circles.So you could only make things
using a straight edge--like a ruler, but not a
measured ruler, just astraight edge--and a compass.So lines and circles,
those are the rules.Those are the rules the Ancient
Greeks had to work by.Using those rules, can you
construct a square with thesame area as the circle?Let's have a look at
what you can dowith rules and compasses.You can add numbers.Here's a line, and
it has length a.And I add another line
of length b.And the whole thing
is a plus b.So you can add numbers togetherquite easily with lines.You can subtract numbers,
as well.If I start with b, and then I
mark off a length, which I'mgoing to call a, then this
bit here, that's goingto be b minus a.We can multiply.If I draw a little triangle
here, this has length 1.And this has length a.I'm going to scale
up the triangle.I scale it up, so now this has
length b, the big triangle haslength b, then this has been
scaled up as well, so thatthis has a length a times b.You divide.Same idea, but it's the
reverse of that.If I took a bigger triangle, if
that has a length of b, andthe long edge here has a length
of a, if I scale itdown so now this has a length
of 1, then this has beenscaled down as well.And you scale it down so
it has a length ofa divided by b.So you can divide by scaling
triangles as well.And there's one more
thing you can do.If I draw a line here,
this is a.I'm going to add 1 to it.That's 1.I'm then going to draw
a semicircle.And this length, here, is
the square root of a.And that's all you can do.That is it.With a ruler and a compass, you
can add, multiply, divide,subtract, workout square
roots, and that is it.That is all you can do.The numbers you make using
those rules are calledconstructible all numbers.So all those numbers are
just repeated useof those few rules.If we had a circle--let's this make this easy.Let's say this circle
has a radius of 1.The area of the circle is pi
times the radius squared.And the radius squared,
that's 1.So the area of the circle
is just pi.So I want a square with
the same area.I want a square now that
has an area of pi.And you may be ahead of me here,
because a square has anarea of pi, the lengths of the
sides are the square root ofpiNow it's at the square
root of pi.We can do square roots.That's allowed.So there's nothing yet to say
that we can't do this.So what's the problem?Well we know that pi
is irrational.Actually, that wasn't
easy to work out.We only worked that out
quite recently.By quite recently I mean 1761.But being irrational
is not enough.There are constructible numbers
that are irrational.You can make the square root
of 2 quite easily.And you can make the square
root of the square rootof 2, and so on.So being irrational is not
enough to say thatthis can't be done.If I'm allowed to make this
a bit more general, if I'mallowed to use other roots,
like cube roots, or fifthroots, or nth roots, if I'm
allowed to add those in aswell, the numbers that you can
make using those rules arecalled algebraic numbers.That's just a bit more
general, same idea.And it turns out that they were
able to prove that pi wasnot an algebraic number.And if it's not an algebraic
number, then it's definitelynot a constructible number.Now this is what I like.The word for a number that is
not algebraic is called atranscendental number, which
is a fantastic word.Now to prove something is
transcendental is really hard.In fact, mathematicians had
shown that transcendentalnumbers existed seven years
before they even found anexample of a transcendental
number.So you have to imagine in those
seven years, people weresaying to the mathematicians,
show me a transcendentalnumber, come on, show me a
transcendental number.But it was a really
hard thing to do.Eventually they found a
few examples of this.But we still have to wait until
we were able to provethat pi itself was
transcendental.And then that was
done in 1882.Once we've shown that, we've
shown that pi is notconstructible.And that is a proof that you
cannot square the circle.BRADY: Can you only not square
this circle given theparameters of these rules
in this game?Could a computer square
a circle?DR. .JAMES GRIME: You can make
a square with sides that havelength root pi.Absolutely.So to the modern day people,
with our tools of algebra--algebra is fantastic.People complain about algebra,
and having tolearn algebra at school.But if we didn't have algebra,
we would be doing maths likethe Ancient Greeks did maths.I promise you, that would
be much, much worse.Your textbooks would
be ridiculous.They'd be very wordy.Algebra is an amazing, powerful
tool in mathematics.It's not there to cause
you problems.It's there for a reason.It's brilliant.So this is easy to make a square
with the area of pi.But using the Greek rules,
straight lines and circles,it's impossible to do.BRADY: You say it's easy
to make a squarewith the area of pi.But because pi has this nature
where the digits continue, andwe can't even get to the exact
figure, surely you can't makea square that's exactly pi.Because you don't even
know what pi is.Or you can do it, can you?DR. .JAMES GRIME: You can do
it and you're treading onsomething called Zeno's Paradox
there, which we'reabout to do next.BRADY: OK.So for a second video in a row
we're going to tell peoplethey have to wait to
find out more?DR. .JAMES GRIME: If that's the
way you want to play it,Brady, that's your choice.This is Brady's decision.He's stringing you along here.The representatives
actually passed itunanimously, 67 to 0.They passed it.Now this is the weird bit.On the same day that they
were passing the bill--
