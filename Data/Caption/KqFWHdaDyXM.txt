7x4 we know will give us a remainder of3but in this session we looked at adifferent way to understand remaindersthe fraction 7 by 4 can also be writtenas 1 3 by 4 which we can also call 1 3/4this is the mixed fraction form where wehave the whole part and the fractionalpart and this is nothing but 1 plus 3 by4 or in decimal terms we can write it as1.75 we have just managed to write 7over 4 in different ways but thisversion tells us a lot about thefraction the remainder is the numeratorof the fractional part which is 3 thequotient is the whole part which is 1and the divisor is 4 the denominator ofthe fractional part the mixed fractionform directly gives us the remainderquotient and the divisor but what if weare given the decimal form and asked tofind the remainder let's say we aregiven 1.75 as the decimal and asked tofind the remainder so we can write 1.75as 1 plus 75 by 100 the remainder willbe 75 the decimal was actually writtenas 175 over 100 so is 75 the answer wait0.75 can also be written as 3 over 4 so1.75 can also be written as 1 plus 3over 4 here the remainder will be 3 herethe decimal was written as 7 over 4 orwe can also write this as 1 plus 15 over20 where the remainder is 15 and thefraction form is 35 over 20 this tellsus that given the decimal form we canhave many possible remainders but if wehave the fractionfor we will have just one remainderyou
