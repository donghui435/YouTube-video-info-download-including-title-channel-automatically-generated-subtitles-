so welcome to my video on the law ofsines up until this point you probablyknow how to solve right triangles butnow we're going to solve a triangle thatis not a right triangle and one of themethods that we use to solve a trianglethat is not right is the law of sinesand I wrote the equation for you for thelaw of sines in the top right-hand partof the screen it says the sine of anglea divided by the length of side a isequal to the sine of angle B divided bythe length of side B and that is alsoequal to the sine of angle C divided bythe length of side C and I drew apicture for you here on the left soeverything's a little easier to seeI drew the angles in uppercase lettersand I drew I drew the lengths of thesides in lowercase letters and let'stake a look at this angle a rightnotice how the opposite side of angle ais side a and that has to be true forall the angles the opposite side of theangles have to be the correspondingletter the same thing for angle B noticehow the opposite side of angle B is sideB and the opposite side of angle C isside C so the point I'm trying to makeis that the the opposite side of theangle has to be the corresponding sideso let's get started right away with anexample okay for this example let's saythat this angle right here is 70 degreesand let's say that the side that'sopposite that angle we'll say that thishas a side of length 10 and let's saythat this side over here has a length ofeight and we're going to solve thisentire triangle and let's label thistriangle before we start doing any workwe'll say that this angle right here isangle a so if this is angle a then theside opposite of that angle has to beside a so that means that this side withthe length of 10has to be side a I will say that this isangle B down here so that means that theside opposite of B has to be side B sowe know that this side with the lengthof eight has to be equal to side B andlast but not least there's only one moreangle left so it has to be angle C andthe side opposite of C which is thebottom side is going to be our side Call right so basically solving thistriangle using the law of sines is goingto be a bunch of plugging and chuggingnotice how we have the angle a which is70 degrees and we also know the lengthof side a which is the length of 10 umso this part of the formula is alreadygiven to us all right so let's plugeverything in to that part of theformula the sine of angle a which is 70degrees so the sine of 70 divided by thelength of a and we know that the lengthof a is 10 so divided by 10 is equal tothe sine of B which we don't know angleB yet so we just gotta leave it blankdivided by the length of side B and weknow that the length of side B is equalto 8 so we can divide this by 8 allright so now we have an equation and wecan easily solve for the angle B so wewant to get B by itself so the firstthing I'm going to do is I'm going tomultiply both sides of this equation by8 and notice how on the right hand sidethe eights cancel out so on the lefthand side we have 8 multiplied by thesine of 70 divided by 10 is equal to thesine of B all right so let's scroll downa little bit so I have a little bit morespace all right so at this point I'mjust going to plug everything into mycalculator if you multiply 8 times thesine of 70 and then you divide that by10 and you plug that all into yourcalculator youget a desk of really long decimal pointI'm just going to round to four decimalsyou get 0.75 1/8 all intermediate stepsyou should probably round to fourdecimal points and that is equal to thesine of angle B all right but we stillhaven't gotten B by itself we that'swhat we're trying we're trying to solvefor angle B and we still have this signin front of it um so in order to get ridof the sign you have to do the oppositewhich is the inverse sine all right soour angle B is equal to the inverse sineof 0.75 1/8 and if we plug this into ourcalculator we get B is equal to theinverse sine of 0.75 1/8 and if we roundthat to one decimal point we get fortyeight point seven degrees the inversesine of 0.75 1/8 is forty eight pointseven degrees so now we know our angle Bso let's plug that into our triangle weknow that angle B is equal to fortyeight point seven degrees all right sonow I'm just going to clear up somespace to give me some more space to workall right so now let's solve our nextpart of the triangle notice how we havetwo angles of this triangle salt saltfour and we know that all three anglesof a triangle are equal to 180 degreesso we know that angle a which is 70degrees plus angle B which is fortyeight point seven degrees plus angle Cwhich we don't know yet are all equal to180 degrees once again the sum of allangles in a triangle are equal to 180 sonow we can solve for angle C quiteeasily if we just add 70 degrees withforty eight point seven degrees we get ahundred and eighteen point seven degreesplus C is equal to 180 once again wewant to solve for C so we want to getrid of this one 18 point seven so I'mgoing to subtract one eighteen pointseven from both sideson the left hand side they cancel outand we get C is equal to 180 minus onehundred and eighteen point seven whichis equal to sixty one point threedegrees so we know that angle C I'mgoing to put this in our diagram angle cis equal to sixty one point threedegrees and once again i'm going toerase some stuff so there's more room towork all right so now there's only onepiece of the triangle that we don't knowyet and that is the length of side C sonow we're going to solve for the lengthof side C all right so we know that thesine of angle C and angle C is sixty onepoint three degrees divided by thelength of side C which we don't know yetthat's what we're solving for is equalto the sine of a the sine of a and onceagain we know that angle a is 70 degreesover the length of side a and we knowthat the length of side a is equal toten all right so we need to solve for Cso I'm just going to get it out of thedenominator first so I'm going tomultiply both sides by C and on the lefthand side the C's cancel out and theonly thing we're left with is the sinesixty one point three is equal to thesine of 70 divided by ten and this isall multiplied by C I'm going to scrolldown a little bit just to get myself alittle bit more space and once againwe're solving for C so we need to get Cby itself so I'm going to get rid ofthis ten and the sine of 70going to multiply by ten and I'm goingto divide by the sine of 70 and whateveryou do to the right hand side you haveto do to the left hand side so I alsohave to multiply by 10 and I have todivide by the sine of 70 all right andnotice on the right hand side how thetens cancel out and the sine of 70 scancel out and on the left hand sidewe're left with 10 divided by the sineof 70 all multiplied by the sine of 601.3 and that is equal to the right handside and the only thing we have left isC on the right hand side all right sonow in order to solve for C we just needto plug the left hand side into thecalculator if we take 10 and we dividethat by the sine of 70 and then wemultiply that by the sine of 60 1.3 nowwe get 9.3 and I rounded that to onedecimal point and that is equal to C andnow we know that the length of side C isequal to nine point three so if we goback to our diagram we know that C isequal to nine point three so now we havesolved our triangle completely we knowthat angle a is equal to 70 degrees weknow that angle B is equal to fortyeight point seven degrees know thatangle C is equal to 61 point threedegrees we know that the side of lengtha has a length of 10 we know that B hasa length of eight and we know that sideC has a length of nine point three so Ihope you enjoyed this video I will bemaking a video on the law of cosinescoming up so stay tuned and I will seeyou in my next video
