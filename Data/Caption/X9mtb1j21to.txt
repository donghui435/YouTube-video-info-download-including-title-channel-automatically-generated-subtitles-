welcome let's discuss Pythagoreantriples that is these are triples ofwhole numbers that turn out to be thesides of a right triangle for examplemany people have memorized that the 3 45 triangle 3 hundreds on one side formthe other 5 on the other side are theyshould the dimensions of a very simpleright triangle and by Pythagoras we havethat 3 squared plus 4 squared is 5squared as a relationship that's truefor right triangles and if you check 9 /16 is indeed 25 so a Pythagorean tripleis any set of numbers that has thisproperty whole numbers I should say anda squared plus B squared equals Csquaredthey're actually hard to find anotherexample of Pythagorean triple is fivesquared plus 12 squared is 13 squaredsome people have that in their heads Ibelieve seven squared plus 24 squared is25 squared one of my favorites is 20squared plus 21 squared is 29 squaredthey can be large 119 119 squared 19 20squared is 169 squared and so on and soonso how am i coming up with these wellthe Babylonians were talking about agood few thousand years BC here listedthese things they eventually had methodsof generating them and then Euclid 300BC actually generated wrote down aformula for how to come up with examplesof Pythagorean triples and in some sensehe proved his formula was complete let'sgo through that it's very elementary inthe following sense many elementaryschool teachers have this sitting at theback of their classrooms great bigmultiplication table so I'm going toshow you is how to use yourmultiplication table to generatePythagorean triples what you need to dois pick two square numbers that you likesquare numbers the numbers appear on thediagonal 1 4 9 16 25 36I'll choose 25 and I'll choose 4 forexample beginning to square numbers allright there it's in the second row andcolumn and the fifth row and column letme look at the two side numbers 10 and10 so I'll make a little square array ofnumbers so what the square array ofnumbers circled in my multiplicationtable what I'm going to do is add thetwo square numbers 25 plus 4 is 29and I can subtract them 25 minus 4 is 21I'm going to add the two side numbers 2810 plus 10 is 20well I claim that 21 squared was 20squared is 29 squared in fact that's thetriple like I said was one of myfavorites let's do this again let'schoose another two square numbers Ichoose say this time nine and one let'slook at that companion sides here we goda-da-da-dah three and three there's atall array over overs of the digits inmy multiplication table add the twosquare numbers 9 plus 1 is 10 subtractthem 8 and add the two side numbers 3 +3 is 6 I now claim that 6 squared plus 8squared is 10 squared I'll just cutresistors dude yet another one let's doa crazy one let's choose 36 and I knowlet's choose 36 and 25 all right addthem 36 times 25 is 40 1 is 61 andsubtract them as 36 tecware 25 is 11 andadd the corresponding side numbers thiscase it's 13 30 is 60 I claimed 60squared plus 11 squared is 61 squaredthere we goso why is this working in factor now youhave fun lots of fun doing this so whyis this work well what I'm really doinghere whoopscan I clear my pens here digit orderlet's be a little abstract let me justerase a square number go to the rulelet's get rid of this guy and let's getrid of this guy and what I'm saying ingeneral is we choose your square numbermaybe it's M Squared and N squared and Isaid let's see where there's some Msquared plus N squared now let a betheir difference which in this casewould be M squared minus N squared and Bwill be the sum of the two side numbersin which case I've got 15 but I'm notgoing to pretend it really is it's goingto be well this is the N throw and theamp'd column this is the M throw and thenth column this is going to be n times nplus another n times Mis to MN so I'm claiming this numbersquared plus this number squared equalsthis number squared little exercise inalgebra he goes a squared plus B squaredgives me is going to be M squared minusN squared plus 2m N squared this will beM to the fourth plus n to the fourthplus the cross terms minus 2n squared nsquared plus 4 M Squared n squared wellthis is M to the fourth plus n to thefourth minus 2m squared M squared plus 4M square there is is plus 2 M Squared nsquares but actually that is M squaredplus N squared squared C squared bingoso this trick of picking two squarenumbers adding them subtracting them andadding up there to second side companionnumbers will indeed give you aPythagorean triple now of course thisbakes the question does every tripleappear this way well let's look forexample discover the famous three fourfive triple is that coming from thismanner is three four five well is fivethe sum of two square numbers yes isfour and one and their difference fourand one is three yep that's checking andlook at the side numbers two and twofour yes three four five does appear inthis manner does 6 8 10 appear in thismanner is 10 the summer two squares yesit's nine whoops missing here it's nineand one is there difference nine and onedifferent subtracted is 8 yep and theside numbers of 9 and 1 would be 3 and 3is 6 6 8 10 appears in this manner wellI'm choosing very basic example let'striple it the 9 12 15 examples thatappearing this manner is 15 the sum oftwo squares and now we're in trouble15 is not 9 plus 4 9 plus 1 16 s 2bigger square number this doesn't appearin this matterwell Euclid 300 BC 2,300 years agoactually managed to prove okay not everyPythagorean triple appears this way butall the basic ones will model a mule bybasic three four five is the fundamentalexample to these guys this is just allmultiples of two everything in 3 4 5triangle double this is everything inthe 3/4 triangle number is triangle 3 45 triangle tripled if you have no commonfactors amongst the terms ABC that's aprimitive example that's a Pythagoreantriple then every primitive example heproved is guaranteed to appear by thismethod multiples of that triple thatprimitive example might not appearthat's okay but the basic one isdefinitely there for sure so mychallenge is to you is to try to provethat claim it's a little bit tricky ittakes some work I believe I have it inVolume one of this thinking mathematicsseries which can go to but try it onyour own you'll get some good deepnumber theory that way all right thanksvery much
