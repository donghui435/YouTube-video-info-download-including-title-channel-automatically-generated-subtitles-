Okay in this video we're going to do anotherexample of simplifying comparing fractional expressions.And in this case what we want to do is we want to,want to make the following statement true. Um,we want to compare the fractions 3/4, 3/4 minus 1/6an 11/12 minus 2/3.We want to think to ourselves, should this be greater than, less than, or equal toto make this true. So we want to figure
out which one of thoseuh, three symbols would make this statement true. Um, in this case all we're going to dois, I'm going to just simply right the left
side is a single fractionwrite the  right side is a single fraction and hopefully that'll be enough to comparethe two.To, to do the arithmetic on the left side we need common denominators.So again the smallest number that four
and six will both go into would be12. So I can multiply the top and
bottom ofmy first fraction simply by three. I can
multiply top and bottomof the second fraction by two and then I
would be left with 9/12 onfirst fraction. Minus2/12 the second fraction and I'm
going to go ahead and simplify that down. Nineminus twois going to give us 7/12.And now we're going to do the same thing for the right side because again I'mnot surewhich, which one of these I should stick in the middle to make this a true statement.Um, so I look at the denominators 12 and threeagain I think the smallest number that
both of those will go into will be12.So I'm gonna leave the first one alone. I'll multiply top and bottomof the second one by the number four and that's going to give me 11/12minus8/12 and again if we do the
arithmetic11 minus eight is going to give us3/12 and now I think it's
pretty clear7/12 is certainly a much greater numberthan 3/12. So it turns out that we
need thegreater than sign to be in between those  two expressionsto make that a true statement.
