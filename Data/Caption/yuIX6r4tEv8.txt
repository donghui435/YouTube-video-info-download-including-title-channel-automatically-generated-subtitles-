hello my name is Maria and this ismathie my mascot and this is GigantaMathis cousin in this lesson we havesome money problems to solve we're goingto use some mental math and also addingin columns and Giganta is here for thislesson because he heard that he's goingto get to go shopping so he wanted toride along on my shoulder and so I'lltry and manage both of them guysElfi okay our first problem you buyheadphones for $12.50 a free player for$45 what is the total cost now this isnot a difficult problem but I want youto try to use mental math so usingmental math we notice that there's justa dollar amount here no sensethis one has dollars and cents so we adddollars and dollars we add the 12 and 45right and then there's going to be thefifty cents so forty five and twelveshould be three to seven and then youhave the fifty did you get the same Imean this is not a difficult problem howabout this one this is more challengingcan we use mental math in this one -Erica buys chicken for seven dollarssixty cheese for five dollars fifty andbread for two dollars fourteen find hertotal bill okay we can look at thenumbers and add let's add the dollaramounts first is seven and two and fiveso that would be 9 + 5 is 14 right $14but then when you look at the cents 50and 60 it goes over 100 cents so there'sgoing to be one more door coming fromall those sentiments so we're actuallygonna get not just $14 but $15 right soI would get $15 another cents60 plus 50 is 110 so I will get 10 centsbecause the 100 cents went to make thedollar 10 cents and 14 cents so 24 centsdid I get it right my face you think sookay another day Erica went shoppingagain and I read about three cans ofbeans for one dollar seven cents eachand paid with ten dollars find her achange before we find a change we ofcourse find the total bill the totalthere's three cans of beans so we gothree times this amount right you canmultiply three times one and then youcan multiply three times seven so weshould get three dollars right and 21cents another changeyou remember counting up adding up westart with this number and add up tillwe reach $10 and so for that you alsoremember in our last lesson we weretalking about adding up 200 so 21 andwhat number you add to this 100 centsand you think of 1 plus what makes 10 2plus what makes 9 or even think ofsubtracting you know 9 minus 2 is 7 10minus 1 is 9sort of 79 cent after 79 cents we wouldbe at $4 and from $4 to $10 is $6 sothat is a change it's right here okaynow we are going to do get to goshoppinglet's read here find the change whenGiganta buys for toy cars for 57 centseach and place with 10 quarters okaywhere did you get the quarters Oh in hispiggy bank okay good for toy cars forthe seven cents each this time I mean Icould do this with mental math but Iwant to show you I want to remind youhow we add money amounts so let's addthe 57 cents here oh it is $0.57 and wehave four cars so we will add this herefour times and this a dollar amount sowe have seven seven seven seven what'sfour times seven twenty eight yep thenover here we have 4 times 5 thats 20 and222 and now you regroupOh Kerry okay and then we have twodollars so the total is two dollars 28he pays with ten quarters how much isten quarters if you can't multiply ityou don't know how to multiply them youcould maybe solve it this way draw thoseten quarters okayfour quarters make a dollar right so youcan see here is a dollar is anotherdollar and this would be 50 Cent's rightso two dollars fifty so he pays with twodollars fifty and his total is twodollars 28 what is the change thedifference between these numbersactually it is just the differencebetween 28 and 50 which is you should beable to tell it is 22 cents so that ischange okay happy yeah I want to goplaying now Matt bought two battinggloves for 2287 eek he paid with $50what is his change this is a fairly easyproblem now right you know what to doright there's not that much to do eitheryou have to adddefine the total and then figure out thechange let's add again okay 2287 justline up the numbers and the decimalpoint and then we add as usual 7 plus 714 then 1880 16 was 117 and regroup herewe get 5 & 4 so that's much total forthe two gloves and now the change we canadd up from this amount and I think thatis even quicker but I'm going to showyou the other way of finding the changewhich is subtract to subtract you take$60 and this number and subtract yeah sowe take $60 and then be fun for the fivedollars it goes here then the similarpoint 74 I need to put zeros here thoughokay to have my $50 and now when you'resubtracting you need to regroup with allthose zeros okay so that's why this isactually even trickier I feel thanmental math but let's do itso there are minus 4 you cannot do it sowe go regroup we need to go all the wayto this 5 and leave for here or $40 for$10 and then here we get 10 then fromthe 10 we take 1 leaving nine and overhere with 10 and then against the samething now we can subtract we get 6 to 4and that's it okay and with the mentalmath going back to that we have 74 centsokay you would find ok 7 plus what makes9 4 plus what makes 10 you would find 26cents right to add up to the next wholedollar26 cents then you would be at $46 andthen 4 dollars Moree andto that to get the $50 so I much prefermental math to find that the changewould be $4 26 and we're all done withthe shopping and we'll be flesh
