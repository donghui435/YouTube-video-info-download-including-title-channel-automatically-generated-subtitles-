is we're going to be using this foilacronym which refers to the first outerinner and last to factor a trinomialmeaning three terms into two binomialsmeaning two groups of two terms so let'stake a look at this first example hereso the way I use the foil method inReverse sometimes it's referred to is Isay how do I get the first term xsquared well the only way to get xsquared really in this case is a to havex times X so x times X those are thefirst terms okay of each of thebinomials that multiplies to give youthe first term x squared then what I dois I jump over here to the last termokay the L stands for last I say how doI get negative 12 well I can either do 1and 12 2 & 6 3 & 4or I could change the order okay I knowthis is negative 12 so it means one ofthese has to be positive 1 has to benegative because a positive times anegative is a negative okay or I couldswitch them but what I'm checking now isthat the outer and the inner terms okayadd up to negative x the middle term soI'll just show you some examples seeit's minus 6 and plus 2 see that givesyou negative 6x and positive 2x that'snegative 4x we want to get negative 1xso let's see how it doesn't match solet's try a different combination howabout X minus 3 and X plus 4 okay thatstill gives us negative 12 the last termso it came all tied together butnegative 3x and negativeI'm sorry positive 4x adds up to 1x butthis is negative 1x so okay well let'ssee we'll change the signs we've got theright number the right coefficient withthe opposite sign so let's make this Xplus 3 now and X minus 4 and now you cansee by foiling that gives you x squaredfirst term negative 12 the last term andif you check inside the ones towards themiddle 3x outside negative 4x adds up tonegative 1 X so you know you've factoredit correctly let's go to another examthree x squared plus 10x minus eightokay so to get three x squared okay thefirst term here with we're going to usethree x + 1 x okay so that gives youfirst times first first term 3x squaredthen we jump over to last term negativeeight well we could do negative 4 timespositive 2 or we could do positive 4times negative 2 or 8 times negative 1and you know you go through thedifferent combinations but what we'rechecking is that the inner product theones towards the inside and that outerproduct add up to 10x so let's see youdo they negative 4x positive 6x that's2x we want 10x hmm let's see if we cantry another combination so you can seewhy they call it the guess and checkmethod sometimes because you're just youknow trying and checking but as you doit you'll start to know which ones aregonna work out a little bit easier okayyou'll go see what's definitely is notgoing to work and you can try the onesthat you think might work and get narrowa little bit faster in your mind as youdo this so it looks like here we want toget a positive 10x so it means that whenwe have a positive number a negativenumber we want the larger one to bepositive okay so let's see maybe if wego like this positive 4 that gives you12 X negative 2 that gives you negative2x that adds up to 10x okay so wefactored it so again you can change theorder you could change the signs okayyou could try a different combinationbut that's how it
