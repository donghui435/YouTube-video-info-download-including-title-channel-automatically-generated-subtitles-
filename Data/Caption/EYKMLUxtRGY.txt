g'day I'm James from the global mathproject and have a question for you avery human question in fact the globalmath approach is all about our humanrelationship with mathematics so here'sour first question for today why are wehumans we Earthlings obsessed with thenumbers 10 12 20 and 60 well first ofall our we obsessed with those numbers10 12 20 60 or they make you think oflet's see 10 10 well we humans are verywhere the number 10 because of theirAnatomy in fact we do a lot of countingwith our fingers all the time so weactually loads associate end withcounting very early on their lives infact some math historians actuallybelieve that maybe that's why we chose abase 10 number system because we justsaw aware of ten and Counting as ourhuman cells however if I'm from Venus Imight have four fingers in each hand soI doubt I'd be obsessed with a number 10in that case we obsess the number eightso rich case maybe L based in countingsystem comes from our humanists ouranatomy and that's why we're obsessedwith a number 10 actually I should pointout the mathis torian's aren't sure whywe chose in the Western culture at leasta base 10 counting system lots oftheories out there this seems the most avery compelling theory about searchingwithout anatomy because actuallysubcultures work with base 20 what mightthey be thing about about if you thinkabout this theory fingers and toes theywere we're counting on both fingers andtoes and actually in the Western worldthere's some vestiges of base 20 in ourculture to example in America that thefamous Gettysburg Address by Abrahamlink which begins four score and sevenyears ago the question is how long agowas that actually four score and sevenwell turns our school is an old word for24 20s and seven years ago for 20s and787 years ago a little bit of base 20right there actually the French whenthey say 87 and French forgive me ownersspeak French I'm going to just make thisgo to ruin this they say captive at setfor 20s and seven a little bit of base20 right there all right sir 10 20 thatcomes from counting maybe that's a goodtheory for that one 12 what I say willbe obsessive number 12 we'll think aboutwhat action we got a lot of 12 s goingrealize you think about dozens we thinkabout a dozen dozens being a grossthere's a lot of old weights andcurrencies involve the number 12 in facthow many inches earn a foot 12 inches ina foot so we actually work with ourbetrothaleven out base-10 system does a littlebit of 12 we say the numbers one twothree four five six seven eight nine tenhave a special Ward 4 11 have a specialword for 12 so special words all the wayup to 12 and we go 13 14 15 the verysystematic thereafter so we even gotlittle 12 nurse in our Bay base 10system kind of wild so where's thatcoming from again Mathis torian's aren'treally sure but they are aware that somecultures were actually thinking basedfor very very early on maybe it camefrom counting this time not countingfive fingers or ten fingers they countfour fingers but as each finger hasthree bones 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12there's one theory wide baby based allcame up for our human selves anotherthing is that actually twelves are veryhandy number to work with in everydaylife often you want to have things takethird of things take a quarter of things12 is good for dividing by 2 3 and 4 10isn't in fact how many inches in half afoot 6 a good whole number how manyinches in a third of a foot for a goodwhole number having interest in aquarter of a foot 3 another good wholenumber so 12 is actually very convenientnow everyday life ah so that's maybe whywe assess for 12 but then there's 60where's that coming from well actuallyit is known that Sumerian some 3,0004,000 years ago we're working in numbersand based 60 so where did that come fromnow mathis torian's really don't have aclear outs on this one lots of goodtheories out there maybe it came fromtwo cultures merging together those werethinking base 10 those are thinkingbased war let's combine those two somecommon numbers come to 10 and 12 thefirst multiple are 10 and tall that'sconvenient one might think of is 60maybe that's why the thing you base 60that we have messages at base 60 stillnet everyday life how many seconds in aminute 60 how many minutes an hour 60 sowe often associate 60 in everyday lifeso maybe it's all coming from anatomy soif I'd get indeed from Pluto or fromVenus I might think base eight or Imight think base 12 maybe they came upwith 12 as well though they're not whydon't have two joints good to thinkabout what would the new shins come upwith is they were thinking in terms ofjoints and fingers good stuff love tothink about this there's also lovelyconnection here too how many degrees ina circle so in another video let's askyou chose the number 32 64 the number ofdegrees in a circle wonderful stuffwelcome to the thinking of the globalmath project
