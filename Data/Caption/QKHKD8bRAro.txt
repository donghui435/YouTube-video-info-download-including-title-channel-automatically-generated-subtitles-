I'm interested in the twin prime conjectureso this isAsking about consecutive prime numbers p 1 as the first prime which be equal to [2] and there'll be the second timeP 2 which would be equal to 3And you can look at the gaps between the primes, so the gap between three and two...is one, this is the only time you can possibly have two prime numbers which differ by exactly one, so the next smallest possible gapWould be a gap of size, [two]It's only not the case that all gaps become size 2But the question is how many of these gaps of size two? So for example,101 and 103 are two rather large prime numbers which differ by exactly 2. And then the twin prime conjecturesays that this having two primes which differ by exactly 2 happens infinitely oftenIf the twin prime conjecture is false,At some point you go along the number line, and then all prime gaps would always be bigger than twoBut we don't believe that's the case. We believe that it should be the case the twin prime conjecture is correctSo no matter how far you go alongThere's always going to be some bigger primes and in fact infinitely many bigger primes that differ byJust exactly two so you can test this on a computerAnd we found pairs of primes that differ by exactly [2] with over300,000 decimal digits and in fact they're surprisingly common that it's certainly not all the timebut if you look at the firsthow far you have to go after a million to find a pair of twin primesIt's not very far. If you look after a billion, It's not very far if you look after a thousand billionIt's actually not very far until you start finding twin pinesMost primes aren't going to have the one after it been just two apartBut we still believe that you should be relatively plentiful and so far if you check on a computer this seems to be truebut whether it's really true all the way as far as you go is something that you can't check on the computer andThat's where you need to try and prove the real mathematical resultSo we don't actually know how old the twin prime conjecture isthat some people have claimed that it should go all the way back to euclid and it's certainly the kind of question that theAncient Greeks could easily have thought about the most recent time where we've seen someone really write down the conjectureofficially was just over 100 years ago by de PolignacBut he actually conducted a rather stronger more general form of the twin prime conjecture that's a bit more complicatedIt's not just gaps of size 2 but also gaps of size 4 and gaps of size sixAnd so there's a suspicion that the twin prime conjecture itself is rather older than thatBut we know it's at least a hundred years old possibly thousands of years old. If we're still finding these thingsWay way down the number line, and we know they're an infinite number of primesThis is a known thing... if they did stopWhat would stop them occurring like what is... what beast out there could stop twin primes occurring?It doesn't seem as any roadblocks of them happening forever.This is one of the interesting and frustrating things about prime numbers,that often it's clear what the right answer should be if you give me a simple problemLike the twin prime conjecture, you can think about it heuristically a bit, you can check it on the computerAnd you can quite quickly convince yourself that this should clearly be the right answerAnd you can do it in a fairly confident way so lots of problems about prime numberswe believe we know what the correct answer should be it's just that we don't know how to prove it andThe game is always trying to rule out there being some very bizarre conspiracy amongst prime numbersThat would mean that they would behave in a rather different way to how we believe that they should behaveSo you're completely right that if the twin prime conjecture was false there'll be somestrange switch that happens at some strange point far down the number lineThere's an absolutely huge breakthrough by Yitang Zhang just relatively recently in 2013He showed that although he couldn't prove the twin prime conjecture (that two is a gap infinitely often)And he similarly couldn't conclude that four is a gap infinitely often, he showed that either two or four or six or eight or some numberLess than 70 million has to be a gap infinitely often. So the gap wasn't 70 millionIt was just somewhere between two and 17 million, but he didn't know what it was?Right, he couldn't say which one of these came as a gap,but he was able to show that at least one of these occurs as a gap infinitely after and 70 million might sound like aHuge number to most people it's certainly a lot bigger than two for exampleBut before that we had no idea of, how we could possibly prove anything like thisThat he showed that no matter how far you go down the number lineThere's always these primes that get clumped bizarrely close togetherBecause when you start looking at really really really big prime numbers, prime numbers become quite rareso if you're looking at numbers with billions and billions of decimal digits for exampleThen suddenly the average gap will be well over a billion and if you look at even bigger ones you get even bigger gapsSo typically prime numbers will have these very big gapsAnd he showed that no matter how far you go down the number line you will get these pairs that come really close togetherAt least compared to how they typically look I guess.Earlier on around 2005,there was this earlier work of Goldston Pintz and Yildirim, who came up with a new method for thinking about the twin prime conjectureand problems closely related to it. People worked really hard to try and pushGoldston Pintz and Yildirim's ideas a little bit furtherbut there seemed to be this big obstacle that we kept on not being able to make progress on andIt was this problem which Yitang Zhang managed to break through, came as a complete shock to everyoneI think precisely because people had worked so hard on thisparticular approach and all the experts had been completely stumped on this. so 70 million is aSlightly arbitrary number that just comes out of the method and in fact his method really just showed some numberAnd he didn't try and optimize the 70 million too much. So if you take exactly his argumentBut you're ever so slightly more careful with the numerical calculationsYou can bring 70 million down to 30 millionAnd then if you tweak his arguments and rearrange things ever so slightly it's still fundamentally the same argument as what he hadBut you can bring 30 million down to 20 million and so as soon as Yitang Zhang's result came outthere was this huge excitement at the result in trying to understand the result, but they also became aSmall online competition amongstMathematicians as toHow low can you make the gap that we knew 70 million was an upper bound, this is the first time we had aFinite bound, but we also knew that by tweaking the argumentsYou should be able to bring 70 million down to some smaller numberHow low could you go just using what he had put out there and putting in the extra work?So there was a polymath projectWhich was a big online collaborative project that set up precisely to try and optimize the arguments in Zhang's work,Now, they came up actually with quite a lot of neat ideas to make Jang's argument as efficient as possibleThey were able to bring Zhang's bound of 70 million down to I think4680.so I'd actually been thinking about aCompletely separate approach to this bound of gaps problem before Zhang's work came outso I was super excited that Zhang's work came out 'Cause it's fascinating to me because I wasstill a phd student at the time. Excited or disappointed? Like did you feel like "Oh no I've been beaten" or were you really excited?So I never had any belief that my ideas would lead to bound of gaps between primes in any way,So I was just excited. I think you always super excited when youSuddenly one of these big results comes out and you know that collectively we understand something new about prime numbersSo I was just desperate to get into the details of Zhang's work. There's always thisIntense frustrating game that you play when you do mathematics that you sort of feel that you have an ideabut you don't quite knowExactly how it fits in and it takes a long time of fumbling around in the darkness before you really get intuition for howWhat you're thinking about works... It's a huge motivation to me that this is part of the funIt's the chase of the problem and trying to understand what's going onSo I was still completely addicted to this thing that I've been working onAnd I viewed it as a side benefit that it might actually be able to help thisbig collaborative project if I could sort my ideas out, but then the huge surprise to me was that actually once I managed toGrasp a hold of this and look at things in from the right perspectiveA variation on the ideas that I was thinking aboutWere able to prove bound of gaps in a completely different way to Zhang's work.This gave a completely new way of proving bound of gaps between timesso both my work and Zhang's work is very much based on the earlier work of Goldston Pintz and Yildirimand Goldston Pintz and Yildirim used an argument that's fundamentally using a technique known as Sieve methodsThey proved a great result about primes which come close togetherAnd they said if we could prove this other technical result that isn't to do with Sieve methodsThen we'd be able to bound of gaps between primes, and so what Zhang managed to do isEssentially proved something like what they wanted to prove and therefore use their argument to get bound of gaps between primes.Whereasmy approach was based on their original ideas rethinking some of the way their original argument worked which meant that you didn't need such aStrong technical input and so I could use weaker results that be known for the past 50 years or so insteadOn the one hand I tend to sort of feel my way to a proof and know it's right before IActually write down all the details so I did have this feeling that yes, this has the feeling of being rightBut at the same time I rememberBeing pretty scared when I first came up with the ideasBecause you know I was going to be very much putting myself out thereAnd it's very important for mathematicians to really be strict with themselves to check that they've got all the details rightbut you often have this internal feeling about these things and it felt like it to me.I was really surprised, so yeah there was suddenly lots and lots of interestI was a postdoc at the time in Montr¨¦al when this came out and suddenly I was getting invitations to fly all overto give talks in different places in the US, so it was really exciting for me being able toMeet all these famous mathematicians, give talks of my work suddenly everyone is very excited. I hadn't really expected this at allI thought you know I was pleased that I'd proven a nice resultBut I was more pleased because I'd finally managed to get an understanding of these things andI had the satisfaction of the proof. I hadn't really expected there to be anyMedia interest or all these people asking me to give talks and things.So some people have called it the Maynard and Tao methodSo Terry Tao was also thinking about similar ideasHe was very actively involved in leading this polymath projectAnd so he came up with essentially the same method at the same timeIt was another bizarre coincidence that there wereThere was this one proof by Yitang Zhang that came out and then both terry and I came up withThis new alternative method. So some people been calling it the Maynard Tao method. So the current state of the art, trying to optimizeAll these techniques including with these new method and these new ideas isIs that they're infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by no more than two hundred and Forty-six. We expect that every even numberbetween 2 and 246 occurs, it's no different, in particular we expect twoBut we know there's at least one between 2 and 246Can your method get us to two?Unfortunately there's aFundamental barrier to our method get my sequel to to you so in some later workwe said that if you [a] really optimistic about how we could maybe get all the technical stages of the argument to fit together andIf you able to prove these other very strong results that were sort of strong versions of what yu tang jang managed to prove thenMaybe you can just about push our methods to get gaps of size at most six infinitely oftenBut we also showed that there's not going to be any small variation onThese sorts of ideas that can really get down to two so you can get close to youBut not quite all the waythere's a new idea that's needed to get all the way to the twin type of injection for sure the reason for it is thatWe have these mathematical devices that are trying to detect time numbersBut they don't work perfectly there are only approximately detected prime numbersSo maybe they get it like one in ten of the time or one insix of the time or something like that, and if you're getting like one in ten at the timeThen maybe if you're looking for primes that come close together you miss a whole load of being between primesBut you still find to that a pretty close togetherSo you may be missed out 10 of themBut on the tenth one you find one and there may be 10 times further apart in you love hopesBut they're still pretty close to get there no variation on these techniques even if you're really optimisticCan ever improve your way of finding primes to one into?Without using some extra automatic information and really a big new idea the fact that your proof has thisTrait to it that it involves approximation of things that aren't always rightDoesn't sound like what I mentioned a method proofIs that already sounds like it's a bit hand wavyAnd wishy-washy I happen to this beat one of these classic rigorous proof if it's like sometimes a bit wronglike so this is actually acommon feature of lots of Modern mathematics that you'll maybe take inspiration fromProbability or engineering and you still have to write down the rivers mathematical proofBut you maybe think about the whole approach in a heuristic wayin a much less rigorous sense and so you might [think] about lots of randomness in your problem, andYou might be deliberately trying tomodel prime numbers as random objects andThink about them is not always being definitive and things being a bit approximate here and thereAnd when you write [down] your argument you have to write it down in a very rigorous wayBut all the intuitive ideas for why you come up with that out one in the first place?often taken inspiration from [Private] [sector] areas ofmathematics and science are you trying to find that breakthrough that will take us to tell you or do you feel like you've made yourContribution, and that's gonna some come from another part of map or are you in the hand still and I would certainly still love toProve the Twin prime conjecture or something like thatAnd I do think about it on Friday afternoons and things that somehow. There's a big new ideaThat's needed and at the moment collectivelyI think we don't really have aClue for how to go about that someone needs to come up with an ideaand it's good to have these problems in the back of your mind because sometimes your subconscious just comes up with aGood idea out of nowhere. So I like to think about it on and offBut I'm not working full time on the twin prime conjecture now just because at the momentI don't have a plausible approach to how to get over their current biasI still get my main motivation from the problems themselves, and I would certainly claim IHaven't I [don't] feel terribly affected by the outside interest the reason that I want toUnderstand things about prime numbers is because I'm fascinated by prime numbersAnd I really want [to] get into the grips of the mathematical dirty details and do this although[I] know that there's lots of good reasons for being interested in timeThere's more generally for applications in the world Real worldAnd they certainly interest that it can be picked up on the popular press and things like that those aren't my personal motivation somehowThere's an inherent beauty about prime numbersThat's always what really motivates me to try and understand the mysteries of these seemingly very simpleBut actually very complicated objects, but you don't get pressuresit's not like a boss will come up and say you know [James] to be really good for us if theNumber two came from here. I certainly not had anyone comeTry and get the enforces to make me bring the gap down so I've not felt any pressure myself. I can't speak for othersWhich one would you most like to see solved which one would excite me the most I?Think the Riemann hypothesis would be the first choice for most number theorists in terms of if you want a problem on prime numbersThe Riemann hypothesis just automatically proves about a million other theorem straight away, just off the batThat's all these firms that say if we're even hypothesis to than this and so youautomatically prove a million other theorems just with this and we have this huge new understanding that even more thanThe Riemann hypothesis as a result the proof and the ideas and the proof that [prove] [the] reason hypothesisInherently must get such a good understanding of prime numbers that will have this whole new way of looking about prime numbersI would guess if someone was able to prove the [Riemann] hypothesisAnd this whole new technique that would open up all kinds of new possibilitiesSo yeah, if I had to choose one, it'd be the Riemann hypothesis does the Riemann hypothesis ever get any of your brain done?Ilike to sometimes think aboutSome questions connected to the Riemann hypothesisbut the Riemann hypothesis itself I feel I have no good intuitive way of even starting to how toattack that kind of problemBut there's lots of smaller problems connected the Riemann hypothesis that are very important for Par numbersAnd those are things that I'm very interested in certainly thinks about quite a lot yeah likely to find your nYou know your true love because the prime numbers are so far apart at that large end of thingsSo it's a pretty loveless placeYou know at that end of things so you get a bigger a bigger numbers you might think there's just no way you're going toFind your true [love]
