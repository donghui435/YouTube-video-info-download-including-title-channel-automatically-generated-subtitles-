welcome there's a popular story outthere about one of the world's mostfamous mathematicians Carl FriedrichGauss it is said that he was a young ladher age eight or twelve or fourteen orsomething depending on who tell me thestory he said given a particularlyuninspired math teacher one day who wasnot feeling like teaching a said okayI'm gonna read a good book and he justkeep the kids busy I had this at thesums one plus two plus three all the wayup to 100 so he started writing this onthe board and as he was describing thison the boardapparently young cows said excuse me sirhow high he going and the teacher saidI'm gonna go all the way up to 100 inwhich case said guess the answer is 5050there for foiling the teachers plan ofhaving a good day of just sitting backand reading so the store usually go isthat Gauss figure at a clever way ofcomputing the sum usually this waypeople say let's give it a name let'scall it s for some say and you've gotthe same some backwards underneathobvious is going to be s again that aplus 2 plus 1 could also be s if you sumthese two together column wise you seeone plus a hundred hundred one another 2plus 99 is another hundred and one threepercent another hundred fifty everycolumn is going to be 101 and of coursehas to equal s plus s twice this sum wewant so how many hundred ones do we havewell 100 so hundred hundred ones istwice the sum so half of that must bethe Sun that's 50 times 101 that's 50 50some people might say that girl said shecame with another method he calledrainbow method is very popular if youlook at the first and last term's theyup to 101 the second a signal last termadd up 201 again the third and the thirdlast term I said 101 you can do it thatway I get confused what happens in themiddle I personally don't have the hangof that one in my head what I do have inmy head is actually a different perchentirely one actually would you like alot I tend to be a visual person I guessI would have been a happy ancient Greekyou like to figure it numbersI like dots and counting dots so let meshow how my brain works we give me thesum of the first two say hundred numbersbut let me do a small picture firsthere's a picture of a 5x5 square I claimit's a picture of the Sun 1 plus 2 Plus3 plus 4 plus 5 looking like what I wantbut going back down again 3 plus 2plus one but if you look at thediagonals here it is there's one there'stwo dots this diagonal makes three dotsthis diagonal is four dots along thisdiagonal is five dots long four dotsagain and we're going back down threedots two dots one dot so this sum isactually all the diagonals of a 5x5square it uses all twenty-five dots sothe answers must be 5 squared 25 but thereason I like that because I see thekind of sum I want in the first part thesecond part almost has what I want thesummer one up to 5 begin but it'smissing the first five so we add five tothe Sun they had five to the left a bitadd five to the right so now I see twicewhat I want is actually this which means1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 isactually 5 squared plus 5 divided by 2well let me go to the gal story has mymind to the gas story why I think Ithink the following let's take the Sunup to a hundred but then let's go backdown again just 98 will a bit down to 3plus 2 plus 1 well in my Greek geometryway that's obviously the diagonals of asquare what's our square 100 100 squaresthat Sun must be a hundred squared thefirst part is what I want what guess washoping for some of the numbers 1 300 thesecond part is almost what I want ismissing hundreds that said 100 to bothsides hundred the left hunter to theright therefore the Sun I want must behalf of this answer too and I believethat's exactly what we had before effecti factor out 100 from the numerator Isee it's a hundred we use 100 behindplus one behind all over 2yep it is indeed a hundred times 101over 2 in general this approach is willgive the ass to the sum in the title sumof numbers 1 to N let's go from our upto n the back down again that's Nsquared the second half is almost arepeat of the first tasks that aremissing and that's at an end to bothsides and I get double what I wantso that sum must be N squared plus nover 2 that's how my brain works I guessI'm a visual kind of guy thanks verymuch
