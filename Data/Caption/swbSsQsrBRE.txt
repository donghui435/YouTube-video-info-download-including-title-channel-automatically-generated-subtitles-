welcome let's explore a triangle ofnumbers I'm gonna do this an unusual waybut if we go against my principles andbasically tell you this whole processwell that's been some time with studentswe go through this over an hour orsomething now he goes but here's afamous puzzle that's going to lead tosomething interesting his grid squaresis the start box here's the end box I'dlike to walk from start to end I'm onlygonna allow myself to take steps to theright one square over to the right orsteps down one squared down and that'sit I'm allowed to move diagonally wellthat moves the left I'm allowed to moveuphow many ways to kind of go from startto end what is a good number ways to gowrite write write write write writewrite down down down down it's very easyway I'm just a mixture of things writewrite down down right down right rightright down right so I'd like to know thetotal number of possibilities and that'sgonna be a bit of work what I do withkids will play with this and will getfrustrated and much more simple examplesfor us to be example anyway it's gonnawatch this square weld only one way togo from started there just take a stepto the right of the possible numberroots can start to that square is one infact you think about it then I wouldways to get from start any square on thetop row is 1 I don't only move to theright there's only one optionditto for the rows going this this cellsgoing down a column from start there'sonly one way to get down to say thisbottom cell down here I only take 4 downsteps now let's get a little moreinteresting what about this cell herehow many ways it's gonna walk to thiscell well I can actually count them Ican go right down or you go down rightthere's two ways to get to here but thisone over here nothing's a little morecomplicated let me start writing thatokay right right down right right downor get over right down right right downright or get up down right right downright rightlooks like there's three ways in factthat was nice but I listed if I hadlooked at this next cell I've got Icould go right right right or down andthen I can play the same game and seethere's actually four positions that Dcould be amongst the three right sothere's four ways to get to here and ifI look at this cell here that's actuallydown down on the right two down to theright there's really the same problem asthis one but just the letters reversedforI'll bet we have a guess what listennext a Lords of the world is gonna be inMexico its economy gonna be but ratherthan go there for the moment let's lookat this cell how many ways can I get tothat so well what I'm doing now I canstart listing possibilities I could goright for right down down right rightdown down we go right down right downright down right down and so on that'sfine I can list those and I'll talkabout that approach in a moment butthere's another way to think our waythrough it in order to get to this GreenDot I've got two options either getmyself to the cell above it and there'sthree ways here and they're taking oneof those three paths and go down to thegreen dot or get myself to this so onthe left there are three ways to getthere I could take one of those threepowers and then take a single step tothe right so that means two gives thegreen dot by the grid of the cell aboveit three ways to get there and take astep down or go to the side of the leftthrough you ways to get there take stepright there's a total of three plusthree six ways to get to that particularcell in fact that argument is beautifulbecause it allows me to quickly startfilling in the rest of cells the of thediagram for example to get to this sawhere either get yourself to the soiljust above it four ways to get there andtake one of the four paths down or getyourself in still on the left six waysand there's six ways to then take a stepright so it's a total of 4 plus 6 10ways to get to this cell well that meansI can fill in this whole diagram nowpretty quickly 4 plus 1 is 5 5 plus 1 is6 6 plus 1 is 7 said was ones that yesthat indeed was the counting numbers 10plus 5 is 15 5 15 plus 6 is 21 28 36 infact I can get myself down here prettyquickly when you do it 4 / 6 is 10 tempis ten is twenty thirty five fifty fiftysix illness he had 84 84 six is 1920last one to goI want two spores 515 3570 oops 126 210there must have been then looks like 330ways to go kind of beginning cell to theright cell so in the spot below of rightcorner using only rights and downs okayI initially write a formula for thesenumbers now and we've actually done thisin another video so I'm not asked us togo to the video on why is zero factorialone and if you've watched that video youwill know what we're really doing hereto get to this e I need to take one twothree four five six seven right stepsright right right right right rightright followed by one two three fourdown steps and that's what's down andthat's one possible route from s to ebut of course any route would be somecombination of hours and days and alwaysinvolves seven hours and always involvefour DS so going from start and isreally equivalent to ask them a questionhow many way it's going to arrange aword if you like of seven hours and 40swell in the Y is zero factorialequaled one video we learnt that thenumber of ways to arrange this wordwould be the number of letters there are11 made factorial over the number ofhours there are seven factorial dividedby the number of DS there are fourpictorial and I bet if you work this outit is indeed 330 so I actually have nowa formula for the entries of this gridexample what is this 15 really wellwhat's coming from one two three fourhours and two DS there's a total of sixletters four which are the hours and twoof them are DS so that's our 15 isreally sick sector of a four factor orover two factorial all right what doesthis got to do with Pascal's trianglewell it's sitting in this it at us rightnow we can see it look at these numbersturn the grid diagonally sideways andread things diagonally so instead oflooking at rows and columns and wouldlook at the diagonals this way and I seefirst dagon was one one of a mess at thetop I then I see 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1this one's got here ones let's move 1 510 10 5 1 10 10 5 1 and sothis trying was very famous calledPascal's triangle has many differentnames and different nations it's beenaround for literally thousands of yearsjust we in the West tend to give a namePascal because he's that he's the firstof the Western scholars to have donesomething significant with this trianglein probability theory but we have aquestion that s at the top must be warright a one at the top is that validlet's see let me go back to my formula Ido here's a one here that represents howmany R's one two three four five hoursand Hemi downszero downs so in the Y is zero factorialequal to one hour video we would knowthe number of ways to get here to rangefive hours and no downs would be at thetotal number of letters is 5 divided bythe number of hours factorial times thenumber of DS backdoor pictorial wellthat's equal to 1 so it's really fighter2 over 5 factorial is indeed 1 so if Ifollow this formula here for the Sthat's 0 hours and 0 DS so Accords theformula that would be the total numberof letters 0 factorial divided by thenumber of hours made factor world liveon Verdes made factorial it's 1 so let'sactually make this a 1 at the top of thegrid now I've turned things sidewayshere let me go back to this order of the15 let me write that have Dean sorrythere's the next row 1 6 15 15 at 24 715 6 1 let's look at this 15 which Ibelieve is the 15 over here we said itwas with Dan still no I can't let'sfigure it out it's one two three fourone two three four hours and 60sMustang 2 DS tell us six letters fourhours and two DS now how do I translatethat to this rotated picture what alittle bit of work and you have to thinkyour way through this is to say that allthis six really corresponds to put yourarm on but watch out this rowcorresponds having node that is at allthat's called at the zeroth row this rowcorresponds to having onewell the one throw here this was eitherone hour or 1d this row across sponsorno two letters let's call this the tothrow they correspond to having two daystwo hours or one of each lip kind and soon so look at this hour fifteen turnsout to be on the sixth verse thenumerator represents which were inPascal's triangle wrong now this four isinteresting it looks like it has goestriangle accounting from beginning withzerolet me count four places in fourstarting at zero zero one two three fourbingolet's count two places in from the rightzero one two so actually if you think itthrough this does correspond to thenumber of hours and B's and needs to befifteen it translates this way on thediagonal picture that the two numbers onthe denominator where we said how manyplaces in from the left and we've passedit in from the right you need to comelike with counting the set the startingthe counts with zero so example what isthis for really well according toPascal's triangle I seem to be on theone zero one two three fourth row soit's four factorialI'm zero one place in from the left I'mzero one two three places in from theright and that is indeed the number fourso there it is there's a formula for theentries of Pascal's triangle finally gotthere thank you
