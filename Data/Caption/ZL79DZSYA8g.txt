welcome his little issue that confusesmany people it's about the balance pointor the centroid of a figure what I meanby that ah let's take a square forexample to be very specific measure thesquare cut out of some sort of heavythick uniformity or like a sheet ofmetal sheet of plywood or something andthe question is is there a particularpoint in the square but we can guess theanswer this Center has always seemed tobe the center for squares such that Icould balance that latch that figure atthat point name we've had some sort ofvertical rod or something like thatcould I balance the square about thatpoint and the answer is yes in an idealworld must be will be convinced that yesthat center of the square would be anideal balance point a thin rod a needleand nail or something but you just hadthe squared sitting right at the tip ofbeing at the center of the square itshould balance ideally so people callthat the balance point or the centroidof the square all right bring a littlebit further if square is actuallybalancing right at this point that itshould balance along any line likeyou've had is like the edge of a knifeI'm trying to draw it this way someasure that's like a knife edge thatgoes through that line whoops as mytemplate knife well certainly thatsquare would also balance along thatedge because if it balances at the pointgiving up more points to balance armsare going to help it out if it's able tobalance right that the single point willcertainly bounced on the whole line ofpoints and the next census of an equalof areas the left and the right of thesesymmetrical so I believe that if thesquare is going to bounce at centroidthat's going to also bounced along anyknife edge that goes through thecentroid that's fine all right here'swhere the paradox lies an equilateraltriangle also has a balance point let mesee if I can quickly draw one in afairly decent way and most peopleprobably guests at the balance point ofan equilateral triangle is going to bewhat they like to think of as a centerof with the three altitudes of thetriangle meet not very equilateral butyou know if I cut out an equilateraltriangle nonetheless a perfect one andtry to bounce on some sort of thin rodsitting up in the air I bet I could doit at least in my theoretical idealworld that there is that the whole thingis going to balance perfectly at thatsingle point which means againtook a knife edge gave it more interestto balance more points to balance onlike a knife edge like this do do mytemplate draw a knife edge again notvery good at this sorry do did you dothat will certainly balance along thatwhole line of points because of abalance that one single point giving itmore points to balance on don't get helpit out not make it worse so here we goso that means this equilateral trianglewill balance long they say this line aswell and that makes sense because I cansee there's equal amount of area to theleft and their edge air to the rightbalance perfectly but here's whatconfuses period people here's theparadox it would also balance along aknife edge that goes say this way againbecause if it goes through the balancepoint giving it more points to balanceon zoning it helped it out don't make itworse which means that my triangle isgoing to balance on a line supposedlyparallel to one of the sides of thetriangle and here's the boring if I wasto actually now look at the area's I'mdealing with let me see if I can paintthe man's you can see two areas I claimthis is problematic because the area onone side of that line is not equal toarea other side the line in fact I canactually draw this pretty well convinceyou of that I will draw all three linesparallel decide and that's not very goodmy pictures totally bad and I mean don'tneed to be that bad and I'll even drawthese guys so I actually have divided myequilateral triangle to what ninesmaller triangles so it looks like rightnow the area to one side of my balancingline my knife edge is one two three fourunits of area and to the other side ofgot one two three four five units ofarea so it's very strange at firstglance that whoops that's very bad thatthis sir bill I'm making Messier sorryif we give me that this area on thisside of the balancing line of four unitssomehow magically balances with fiveunits of area on the other side of theline most people argue there's no waythen this triangle can balance acrossthat line right thereyet at the same time that line goes tothe centroid so it should be balancingon that line so here's my paradoxicalquestion does what does not that doesn'tmake sense that it does do or don'tdon't or do triangles balanced alongknife edges that are parallel to oneside of the triangle just a simple yesnot answer now this is really a physicsquestion it's also a math question ifyou know the physics of fulcrums and allthe rest but I'd like an explanation forthis paradox that most anyone canunderstand just really a little basicmath don't give it to calculus is a veryconvincing argument that a ninth ortenth grade algebra student couldunderstand that would convince me thatthis triangle either does or doesn'tbalance and on that knife edge that's myparadoxical question there we go soapparently these these lines of balancebalancing don't do or don't have equalairing at this either side mysteriousquestion thanks so much
