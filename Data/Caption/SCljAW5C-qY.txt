welcome everyone at some point in one'slife it's almost a moral imperativeshould play with the mobis band or moviestrip a me doing on a video now likethis is a little bit silly you reallyneed to get some paper and some scissorsand tape and do the following so if youhave a pick scissors tape paper andscissors take a rectangle of paper assimply bend it around and glue the lefthand to the right hand and that wouldmake a cylinder of paper so hopefully mydiagrams are sufficient to make sensehere so you have a little band of papernow if I draw on this band a dotted linegoing through the middle of it and itgoes through the back as well did itover and I got at my scissors and cutalong that dotted line if it was easiestto draw the dotted line first on thepaper on both sides and you'll seeeverything going on clearly that willproduce for me two separate rings ofpaper one band whoops very bad pictureon the top and the second band on thebottom that separate lastly what Mobiusdid was imagined okaydo the same thing take your strip ofpaper with the dotted line drawn on theback and the front down the middle asshown but instead of gluing it directlyleft to right put a twist on it that isglue the left hand to the right hand butwith a half band and what I mean by thatlet me should twist the paper and you'llget something like this going on duty todo and this construct here it's a bandof paper again another ring with a twistin it and here's the dotted line or Ishould go through this twist kind ofclevermake this up and cut it along the dottedline just follow the dotted line blindleaders just do whatever the deadlinesays followed all the way through andsee what comes out and what you find isyou won't get two separate piecesbecause normally cutting something inhalf separates into two parts you're farthis is one great big and I can't evendraw it sort of the hand of paper nowwhy is that the case so you should pausethe video to make one of these thingscut in half and you'll see that you onlyget one piece of paper as a resultwhere he goes it's pretty easy toexplain if you look at the originalrectangle what we did here is oh so Idon't mean to do thatcancel that is we've just taken one endso I'll take this part of the paper herewho suppose my pen go I'm having troublethat top at the top of the left side ofthis rectangle is actually glued to thebottom right at the lecturer angleeither of the rectangle am i sayingsorry and the bottom half on the left ofthe rectangle is glued to the top halfof the right of the rectangle so thehalf-twistahead of us through this sort sort herewe're taking a nice something like thisalign the green dot with the bluefuzzies like that now it kind of makessense that the result has to be a singlepiece of paperwe've all definitely got this area ofpaper all on the top half they comealong come alongeven though it's cattle on the dottedline this green dot is attached that'sother part of the green dot over here sothis paper is still attached to thebottom half if you're going wrong we'llstill single piece of paper to the bluefuzzy part of the bottom half of thejoin is attached to the top of thedrawing so I can see actually these twowhat I think are going to be separatehalves of the paper are actuallyattached to make one great big band ofpaper in the end and of course ours arefound to be had what's stopping you fromjust putting more than one half twistwhere he put two half twists in thepaper and got a little diagram like thisto do a little bit helpful draw pharmacychop that in half well actually myanalysis this time will termed tells meI will get actually two pieces of papersresult if I put in two half twists hegoes draw the dotted line on the leftand the right this part or the bottompart of the Left would be or glued howone half twist strings it's matchingwith the top half but the second halftwist brings it back down to here andditto the top half of the left will beafter two half twists go the bomb halftop half of the rightso now I could see that this top half ofthe paper as I move along is actuallyattached back to itself and the bottomhalf is attached to itself so this willresult to half twists turn on the centerwill give me two pieces of paper nowthese two bands are likely to be intertweening because it seems to be twirlingthem around each other so I bet you'llget two interlocked bands so you playthis game forever today put it in threehalf twists in the movie strip put it afull half twists and you can analyzewhat's going to happen by drawing thisrectangle first and then check yourpredictions by actually doing it now nowwe'll get to the fun part what I'd liketo do in my mind matha clubs forstudents is you know don't just do theorder things everyone's done this wellif you start putting in multiple halftwists great done that or if you startcutting along four thirds positioninstead that is if I take about arectangle of paper draw on both sidestwo lines and then create from that aMobius band as follows so I'm not doingbigger picture by doing a lousy pictureoh my goodnessand then ask yourself what happens if Icut along each of the third lines aroundthis diagram what results thenin fact keep going this is a pureexploration lots of hours of fun to behad with bits of paper let's get reallyreally crazy here's all my favoritethings to do take your rectangular paperagain but this time added the left cutout a half loop and out of the right cutout another half loop and if I justglued the top part of the left hand tothe top out of the right hand do it forthe bottom part of the left hand bondthe part of the right hand you'll seeyou'll get another band of paper butwhoops there they go but if you followmy 3d drawings it's a band of paper witha hole in it so I get a picture kind oflike that my question is if I cut alonga dotted line around the hole what willhappen well clearly you seeI'll get this bad of paper will justseparate that from the hole and we havea bigger hole but suppose I had arrangedit that before I glue the top hand tothe top end I put in a half twist likethis excuse me it's a little mobiusfeature going on at the top and now Istill again attempt to cut around thathole this could be trickier toomaybe when you make this thing I'dadvise you to draw the dotted line onthe left or the original paper before weglue it do it on the left on both sides- on the right on both the back on thefront sides then he actually clearlyfollow this dotted line and then justblindly and religiously follow thatcutting on that dotted line and see whathappens but then the fun doesn't stopthere what if I decide to put and saythey have twists on the bottom portionof this hole as well in the samedirections the top half twists or maybein the opposite parity to the top halftwists if I put in seven half twists onthe top end and five half twists in theopposite direction bottom in whatresults may be fun to do these make atable of all the possible possibilitiesand see being analyzed why what you'reseeing is actually what's the rightthing to see lots of funin fact the fun really doesn't stopthere do go to this book every if youlike to see some more devilish thingsone can do with Mobius bands all rightthanks very much
