okay in this video I just want to talkabout finding the slope of a line andfinding the slope of a long and it's nottoo bad just a little formula you gottaremember and it says we define the slopefor some reason week we call the slope Mwe define that to be the change in the Ycoordinates so we take y2 minus y1 overx2 minus x1 intuitively we say it's therise over the run and you can alsoabbreviate that as the Delta Y overDelta X and this is read as the changein Y over the change in X well in thiscase I've got the point 1 comma 2 & 5comma 4 if we want to find the slope Icould almost just count so notice Iwould have to go up a couple units andagain I'll abbreviate that Delta Y forthe change in Y and notice I would Ialso have to go over a few units to getover to the new coordinate that's goingto be Delta X and we could actually justcount you know I think we could justcount here and figure out the slope soit says the rise how many units would wehave to go up well if I'm at 2 and Iwant to get to a height of 4 I wouldhave to go up 1 2 units so the rise inthis case would be 2 units or the changein Y would be 2 units the run that's howmuch you move horizontally well if I metone I would have to go 2 2 3 4 5 so thatwould be 1 2 3 4 units or it says myslope would be 1/2 we could also labelthese and just use our slope formula andif we just label these so maybe thiswill be the first point I'll call this Xsub 1 and I'll call this number Y sub 1this will be my second point over hereon the right so I'll call that one X subtwo and the other one y sub two and itsays if I want to calculate the slopeagain I could use the formula so it saystake the Y sub 2 which is 4 subtractaway the Y sub 1 which is 2 and noticeon top that'll give us 2 again we'resubtracting the Y coordinates so that'sgoing to give us the change in Ylikewise if we take the change in X Icould take five subtract away the xcoordinate which is 1 the X sub 1 whichwill give again get me 4 or again it'llgive me 1/2 just like we got a secondago ok so this isn't so bad justremembering a formula you know herenumbers are nice and hold so maybe wecan do one a little bit trickier wherethe numbers you know maybe would be alittle bit harder to count things offand remember as well if our line isincreasing as we move left to rightremember that we said that those lineshave a positive slope associated withthem and 1/2 is certainly a positivenumber ok so let's do uh let's maybe doone other one here I'll just stay in thetop right quadrant since that's whereI'm atlet me pick numbers that are maybe notso nice suppose this is the point 1point 5 comma looks like we're a littlebit higher than 2 let's say 2 point 3 sothis will be my x-coordinate my bluepens dying on me hereso that'll be my first coordinate herethis point one point 5 comma two pointthree and let's pick another point hereas well focus this a little better let'spick another point here suppose I'm atthe point 5 comma so here's negative 2let's stick it a little bit highersuppose this is 5 comma negative 1 point7 ok so this is a case where youprobably don't want to count things outok so again I'll call this little X sub1 I'll call the second or that the ycoordinate y sub 1 this will be my X sub2 value this will be my Y sub 2 value soagain if I play connect the dots I knowthat this line is going to be decreasingand if it's decreasing I know that theslope should work out to be somethingnegative so if I don't get a negativenumber already I know that I've donesomething wrong so it says it's theslope it says we can subtract the Ycoordinates and it doesn't matter if youlabel this when X sub 1 Y sub 1 we couldcall this point X sub 1 Y sub 1 and thisone X sub 2 y sub 2 everything willstill work out you'll get the exact sameslope so we'll take Y sub 2 which is onepoint seven I have to subtract away theother y coordinate which is two pointthree I'll have to take my X sub 2 whichis 5 I'll subtract away the X sub 1which is one point five and now it'sjust a matter here of doing ourarithmetic and one point seven minus twopoint three is actually negative 4/5minus one point five that's three pointfive so technically that's our slopeusually they'll make the slope havewhole numbers we'll get rid of thedecimals well to do that I can multiplythe top by 10 and the bottom by 10 aswell and when we do that our newfractionwe'll get negative for on top excuse menegative for T on top and we'll get 35on the bottom well 5 goes into both ofthese so we can reduce this if we divideby 5 we'll get negative 8 on top andwe'll get positive 7 on the bottom sothat'll be the slope of our new linenegative 8 over 7 okayso finding slope is obviously criticallines show up all over the place inmathematics so you'll want to be able tocalculate slopes with no trouble at alland you'll also need this to findequations of lines so hope these coupleexamples make some sense if you have anyquestions just post a comment on theYouTube video and either me or hopefullysome other nicer you were out there cancan answer your questions
