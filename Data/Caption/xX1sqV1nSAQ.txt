Hello.I'm Professor Von Schmohawk
and welcome to Why U.We have seen that multiplying any
decimal number by tenshifts each digit in the number
one column to the left.In the last lecture,we used this trick to convert decimal numbers
with a finite number of digits into fractions.In this lecture, we will see how to convert
"repeating" decimal numbers into fractions.Repeating decimal numbers have one or more
digits after the decimal pointthat repeat forever.As an example, let¡¯s convert a decimal number
with one infinitely repeating digitinto a fraction.The first step is to eliminate the
infinitely repeating digit.We do this by first multiplying the number
by ten to shift it one column to the left,and then subtracting the original number.Since both numbers in this example have an
infinite number of repeating fives,this eliminates all the repeating fives
after the decimal point.We know that our original decimal number
is equal to some fraction,but we don¡¯t yet know
what that fraction is.However, we do know that when it is subtracted
from ten times itself, we get five.Let¡¯s write this statement as an equation.Ten times the fraction,minus the fraction,equals five.It is possible to write this statement
more simply.Subtracting one thing from ten things
leaves nine things.So instead of writing
¡°ten times the fraction, minus the fraction¡±we can simply write
¡°nine times the fraction¡±.Since both sides of the equation are equal,we can divide each side by the same number
and they will still be equal.Let¡¯s divide both sides by nine.Notice that on the left side of the equation,the fraction is
multiplied AND divided by nine.This leaves its value unchanged,so we can cancel out the nines
on the left side of the equation.We are left with an equation which says that
the fraction is equal to five-ninths.We have converted our repeating decimal number
to the fraction five-ninths.Let¡¯s try this again
with a repeating sequence of threes.As we did in the previous example,
we eliminate the one repeating digitby multiplying by ten one time,
and then subtracting the original number.This eliminates all the repeating threes
to the right of the decimal point.So ten times the fraction, minus the fraction,
equals three.We write this as an equation
which we can simplify to say:¡°Nine times the fraction equals three¡±.We then divide each side of the equation
by nineso that the nines on the left side cancel.This equation tells us that our fraction
is equal to three-ninths.Of course the fraction three-ninths
can be reduced to one-third.So we have converted this repeating decimal
number to the fraction one-third.Now instead of a single repeating digit,let¡¯s convert a decimal number with a
repeating sequence of three digits.Since there are three repeating digits
to eliminate,we must shift the number three columns to
the left, by multiplying it by ten three times.This, of course, is the same as
multiplying by one-thousand.We then subtract our original number,
which eliminates the repeating digits.Now we write this as an equation:One-thousand times the fraction,minus the fraction,equals one-hundred-twenty-three.One-thousand times the fraction,
minus the fractionis the same as nine-hundred-ninety-nine
times the fraction.And dividing both sides of the equation by
nine-hundred-ninety-ninecancels out the nine-hundred-ninety-nine
on the left.So our fraction is equal to one-hundred-twenty-three
nine-hundred-ninety-ninths.Let¡¯s see what happens with the repeating
decimal numberzero-point-one,
followed by an infinite number of sixes.Since there is only one repeating digit, six,we shift the number one column to the left
by multiplying by ten one time,and subtract the original number.This eliminates the repeating sixes,and we are left with one-point-five.We then write the equation:"Ten times the fraction, minus the fraction,
equals one-point-five",which we can simplify to¡°Nine times the fraction
equals one-point-five¡±.Dividing both sides of the equation by nine
eliminates the nines on the left,and we see that our fraction is equal to
one-point-five over nine.But we have a problem.A fraction¡¯s numerator and denominator
must be integers.We can solve this problem by multiplying the
top and bottom of the fraction by tento create two integers.This gives us fifteen-ninetieths,which can be reduced to one-sixth.So this repeating decimal number
is equal to one-sixth.As a final example, let¡¯s reduce a number
that has the repeating sequence of digits,one-four-two-eight-five-seven.Since there are six repeating digits,we shift this number six columns to the left
by multiplying it by ten six times,which is the same as multiplying by one-million.We then subtract the original number.This eliminates all but one copy
of the repeating sequence.We are left with the integer,
one-four-two-eight-five-seven.We then write the equation:"One million times the fraction,
minus the fraction,equals one-four-two-eight-five-seven."Using the same logic as before,the left side of this equation
can be simplified tonine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine
times the fraction.Dividing both sides of the equation by
nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine,leaves us with an equation which says that
our number is equal to the fractionone-four-two-eight-five-seven
over nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine.Using the factoring techniques we learned
in the lecture on reducing fractions,this scary-looking fraction
can be reduced to one-seventh.So we have discovered that
this repeating decimal numberis equivalent to the fraction one-seventh.This concludes our lectures on fractions.So far we have learned about the properties
of the arithmetic operationsaddition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.In our next lecture, we will introduce the
mathematical operation of "exponentiation".
