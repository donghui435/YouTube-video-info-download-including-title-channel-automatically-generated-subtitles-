most of us don't even know the correctdefinition of a polygon we think it's afigure with more than four sides threesides triangle four sides quadrilateraland more than four polygons and this isso wronga polygon is simply a closed figurewhich is formed by line segments in thesame plane that's the correct way ofputting itclosed figure formed by segments in oneplane so let's draw a figure like thisis this a polygon absolutely it's aclosed figure formed by three linesegments in this same plane so yes atriangle is a polygon what about thisfigure yes this is a polygon too closedline segments one plane even a hexagonwhich has six sides is a polygon andwhat is a regular polygonit's a polygon which is equilateralwhich means all its sides are equal andit's also equally angular all its anglestoo will measure the same one of themost important concepts about polygonsis the sum of the interior angles thesum of the interior angles of a polygonwill equal n minus 2 times 180 degreesand you can probably guess what n isit's the number of sites in that polygonyes this works for any and every polygontake a triangle for instance it hasthree sides based on the formula the sumof the interior angles will be threeminus two times 180 degrees and thatequals 180 degrees pause the video andtry it for a quadrilateral and aPentagonas the number of sides is 4 we get thesum of angles for a quadrilateral as 360degrees and as the number of sides in aPentagon is 5 the sum of angles is 540degreesdon't forget this concept you willalmost always get asked a question basedon it
