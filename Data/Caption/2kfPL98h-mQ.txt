in this video we will begin looking atdifferential equations and will just betaking an introductory look differentialequations is a really big topic entirebooks are written just on this one topicbut we'll just be looking at anintroductory level and seeing whatdifferential equations are and how theyare solved and I'll start off by puttingan example of one on screen here axequals DX DT now take note here's X andhere's the derivative of X with respectto T and we can think of T as being timethat's often the case so the fact that Xhas a derivative with respect to Timplies that X is a function of T this Xright here isn't simply a variable it'sa function and in this case it's afunction of T or a function of time sothe essential aspect of a differentialequation is that a function and itsderivativeboth show up in the equation that's whatmakes it a differential equation soremember that X here isn't just avariable that can have a value X is afunction and the function and itsderivatives show up in the differentialequation now if we want to solve thisfor X that means we need to find thefunction X that satisfies this equationso solving the differential equationdoesn't mean we find the value for xthat works we find the function x thatworks so this is a little bit differentthan solving simple equations like wedid way back in algebra 1 for example ifyou had this X plus 4 equals 10 and youwant to solve this equation that meansfinding the value for x that makes thisequation true and obviously x equals 6is the solution because if we plug in a6 right there for X then that's a truestatement this is different we're notfinding a value we're finding a functionX is a function of T so solving thedifferential equation means to find thefunction which will satisfy thatdifferential equation and sincederivatives show up in differentialequations by definition the solution orfinding the solution to a differentialequation often involvesintegration now here's a multiple-choicequestion differential equations are anot really all that important or be areally huge gigantic tremendouslyimportant big deal let's see we'll checkbox be right theredifferential equations are veryimportant in fact differential equationsare really the equations that mostnaturally describe processes in the realworld when you look at the world andespecially when you look at it in termsof physics you naturally come up withdifferential equations to describeprocesses and things that you see goingon in the real world and solving thedifferential equations is what oftenleads to good theories of physics thatdescribe good and useful theories thatdescribe things that are going on in thereal world and we'll see examples ofthis as we go through this material whatwe'll see how differential equationsarise from an understanding of thenatural world especially in terms ofphysics and how solutions to themprovide us with equations that describehow things actually behave in this worldin college if you study physics orengineering you'll probably have anentire course on differential equationsa typical college math sequence mightlook like thisyou have calculus one which is integralcalculus or excuse me differentialcalculus and then calculus two which isintegral calculus integration and thencalculus three is typicallymultivariable calculus and thendifferential equations which is commonlyreferred to as de so that's typicallywhere it falls in college-level mathsequence sequence now as our firstexample I'm going to show you adifferential equation that arises fromHookes law so first of course we need tomake sure that everybody knows whatHookes law is this is named after RobertHooke the physicist who lived at thetime of Isaac Newton although Newtonreally didn't like hook hook wasactually the guy that kept Newton out ofLondon not intentionally but Newton justdetested him so much that Newton stayedin Cambridge for decades and didn't moveback to London until Hooke died newbeing the incredibly introverted personhe was didn't really like people at allso he just stayed out of town untilHooke died but this is one of the ideasthat hook came up with this explainswhat some this explains the the force ina spring this is a wall over here andlet's suppose we have a spring attachedto the wall like this and we grab thespring here and we we pull that out thisway some distance X and when we do thatthe spring pulls back so there's somesome force back in this direction F andHookes law says that F equals negativeKX now this should make senseintuitively you've all stretched aspring before or something springy likea rubber band and you know the fartheryou stretch it the more force isrequired so the force is proportional tothe distance like that equation says andif we pull it to the right it pulls backto the left so there the the distanceacts and the force that the spring ispulling are in opposite directions andthat's why we have the negative sign sothis makes sense intuitively and it alsomatches the empirical evidence as longas we don't stretch the spring beyondwhat's called the elastic limit of thespring then it's going to behave in anamazingly linear fashion just like thisequation implies okay now imagine thisimagine we have a wall and the floor andhere's our spring attached to it andthen let's suppose we have this mass onthe end of the spring it's resting onthe floor there I'm going to extend thefloor a little bit okay so there's amass in and suppose we pull it out adistance X so we pull it out somedistance X and we release it and there'sgoing to be a force pulling back fromspring and we're going to assume thatthere's no friction here so it slidesfreely a claw across the floor althoughwe certainly could include the case thatinvolves friction and we would do thatlater on but we'll do the simple casefirst where there's no friction well weknow Hookes law tells us that F equalsnegative KX this is an accuratedescription of what's going on with thisforce in this distance but we also havean M here a mass and when you thinkabout a force acting on a mass whattypically comes to mind is Newton'ssecond law Newton's second law says Fequals MA okay so here here comes thedifferential equation if we start offsaying F equals MA and we also know thatF equals negative K X then we can saythat ma equals negative KX and I knowthat a the acceleration is the secondderivative of position so I can writethis I can write in times the secondderivative of X d squared X DT squaredequals negative KX and look at thishere's X and here's the derivative of Xactually the second derivative of X butwe have X and it's derivative showing upin this equation this is a differentialequation and it shows up naturally fromour understanding of physics in thiscase the physics involving the force ina spring and Newton's second law and itshould make sense to you that X is afunction of time if we pull this out acertain distance X and release it thespring is going to pull it back and asit pulls back it's going to gain somemomentum back toward the wall but it'sgoing to get that it's going to get upenough speed to overshoot the point atwhich it started and it's going to gotoward the wall compressing the springand as the spring compresses it's goingto exert a force back to the right andthat's going to cause it to slow downand stop and move back to the right andit's going to oscillate back and forthand that's youmake sense you pull this out and it goesboring going going back and forth thefrequency at which it oscillates isgoing to depend on the mass and thestiffness of the spring but it's goingto be a function of time X is a functionof time and this is the differentialequation which describes this situationnow we could do some math to solve thisequation we could find a function X Xbeing a function of time that satisfiesthis differential equation the math todo thatis fairly difficult but the solution isnot that bad I'll show you what thesolution is if we did the math to solvethis the solution would be X is equal toX 0 that's the initial position timesthe cosine of the square root of K overN times T where K is the stiffness ofthe spring from that equation F equalsnegative KX and M is the mass so theposition X here is a function of timeand we could differentiate this twice wecould find the second derivative of thatand show that it satisfies this equationand that's not too hard to do getting tothis equation from here is a little bitmore advanced than we're going to doright now but we'll come back and someof the exercises and at least show thatthis does in fact satisfy that equationnow in the next video I'll show youanother differential equation that showsup in the real world and we'll actuallywork through the solution and show howyou get from the differential equationto the solution
