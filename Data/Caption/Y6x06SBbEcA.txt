all right in this video I'm going to dosome examples of solving rationalequations and another video I talkedabout simplifying rational expressionsand you can use those same techniqueshere but I think maybe there's aslightly easier way to do it so in thiscase we have to solve the equation sixover x squared minus five over x equalsone and what you're going to do isbasically probably the easiest ways totry to get rid of the fractions and whatyou do is you look at the denominatorsof all the fractions and you take theleast common multiple of those things sohere our least common multiple of X andx squared is going to be x squared sowhat I'm going to do is I'm going tomultiply both sides of this equation byx squared so I have six over x squaredminus five over x equals one so I'mgoing to multiply the left side by xsquared you have to multiply the rightside by x squared as well my leastcommon multiple when I distribute it outforget about the stuff at the bottomthere's my next example peeking throughwhen you multiply this stuff out the XSquared's will cancel out and thenyou'll be left with a 6 when youdistribute you'll have x squared over Xwhich will leave you minus five x equalto x squared and now this is just aquadratic equation okay so I've got 6minus 5x equals x squared and withquadratic equations remember the easiestway to usually do them is to set oneside equal to zeroI'll make the left side zero and thenyou try to factor it out so I'll add the5x to the right side I'll subtract the 6/ excuse me yes sorry it looks okay I'lladd the 5x and subtract the 6 and thenI'll try to factor this out and it lookslike a way that would factor is we use xplus 6 and X minus 1 and then we simplyset each piece equal to zero so X plus 6equal to 0 will give us the solution ofx equals negative 6 X minus 1 equals 0will give us the solution of x equals 1and this is the thing you have to becareful about when you do these rationalequations you have to put the solutionsback into the original expression theoriginal equation rather and make surethat you're not dividing by 0 so noticeif I plug negative 6 into the bottom ofeither fraction it doesn't give me a 0the same thing with a 1 if I know if Iplug 1 into the bottom of eitherfraction it doesn't give me a 0 so thoseare in fact our solutions negative 6 andpositive 1 all right so here's our nextexample here 2 over X plus 2 plus 2times X minus 4 equals 1 well in thiscase our least common multiple is goingto be X plus 2 times X minus 4 so I'mgoing to multiply both sides of ourfraction by that so I've got 2 over Xplus 2 plus 2 over X minus 4 equals 1 soI'm going to multiply the left side by Xplus 2 so you can squeeze it in here Xplus 2 times X minus 4 and then I haveto multiply the right side as well by Xplus 2 X minus 4 so sorry it got kind ofsqueezed in there but when I distributethis X plus 2x minus 4 term the X plus2's will cancel and that'll leave mewith 2 times X minus 4 plus then when Idistribute the X plus 2 X minus 4 the Xminus 4s will cancel out and that willleave me with 2 times X plus 2 and onthe right side I'm going to have thisquantity X plus 2 times X minus 4 andI'm going to go ahead and foil that outI'll get x squared negative 2x minus 8after I collect all my like terms andI'm going to multiply out the left sideso I'll get 2x minus 8plus two x plus four equals x squaredminus two X minus eight again this is aquadratic equation I'm going to make theleft side equal to zero in this casenotice if I add 2x and 2x I'll getpositive for X I'll have to subtractthat from the right side so I'll getnegative 2x minus 4x will give menegative 6x notice on the left side aswell I have negative 8 plus 4 which isnegative 4 if I add the so to get rid ofthe negative 4 I'll have to add 4 toboth sides and if I add 4 to both sidesI'll get a negative 4 on the right sideso I think I didn't do anything crazythere so I've got positive 4x I'llsubtract 4x and then I've got a negative4 if I add 4 looks ok and at this pointthis looks like a problem that's notgoing to factor down so to figure outthe solutions you could at this pointuse the quadratic equation or excuse methe quadratic formula and remember thatsays you have negative B plus or minusthe square root of b squared minus 4acover 2a and in this case our negative 6is playing the role of negative B sowe'll have negative negative 6 plus orminus the square root of negative 6squared- 4 times a which is 1 times C which isnegative 4 all over 2 times a so thiswill give us positive 6 plus or minusthe square root underneath looks likewe're going to get 36 plus 16 which is52 over 2 and I would probably justleave my solutions like this I wouldn'treally simplify it down any furtherso negative or excuse me positive 6 plusor minus the square root of 52 over 2 ifyou haven't seen the quadratic formulaI've got some examples on my website aswell using the quadratic formula tosolve these equations and this is goingto give you definitely not negative 2and not positive 4 so these would bothbe solutions to the original equation solet's do one more so in this problem Ihave X plus 3 in the bottom 1 over Xplus 3 plus 1 over X minus 3 equals 6times x squared minus 9 and here theleast common multiple of X plus 3 Xminus 3 x squared minus 9 well if youfactor x squared minus 9 you actuallyget X plus 3 X minus 3 and that's goingto be my least common multiple that I'mgoing to multiply both sides by so I'llhave 1 over X plus 3 plus 1 over X minus3 equals 6 over x squared minus 9 so onthe left side I'm going to actuallywrite it out as X plus 3 X minus 3 so Ican see how things cancel nicelyand on the right side instead of writingX plus three X minus three equivalentlyI'm going to write x squared minus nineokay so when I multiply this out in thefirst term the X plus 3s will cancel andthat will leave me with X minus three onthe second term the X minus 3s willcancel and let I'll leave me with X plusthree on the right side I'll simply havesix when you add X plus X you get two xtwo x equals six and now if you divideboth sides by two we'll get x equalsthree but notice now if we check thesolution if we plug it back into theoriginal okay if I plug 3 into thebottom of the first fraction it's fineit doesn't give me zero but notice if Iplug three either into the second termor the stuff on the right side of theequation I'm going to get zero in thebottom of my fraction actually in twoplaces and if you get zero even in thein the bottom of one fraction these arewhat are called extraneous solutions sothis original equation actually has nosolutions so you have to be real carefulon these rational equations that you goback whatever answers you get you needto go back and plug them into theoriginal equation to make sure thatyou're not dividing by zero so hopethese videos helped a few kind of basicones if you have any questions feel freeto shoot me an email and I'll be happyto answer it as soon as I can
