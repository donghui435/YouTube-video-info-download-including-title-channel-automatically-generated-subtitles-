welcome let us explore the question whatis zeroraised to the zeroth power what we'veseen in a previous lesson on trickyexponents that two to the zeroth powershould be one and in that lesson there'snothing special about the number twothere we could have worked the numberthree to see that three to the zeroth is1 or 17 to the zeroth power is 1 or PIto the zeroth power is 1 so given thework of that lesson it seems appropriateto say that 0 to the zeroth power is 1however I'm going to be a little strangeright now I'm going to argue that 0 tothe zeroth power is actually 7 and ahalf he goes how could that bewell I'll use the algebra of exponentsto convince us that 0 to the zerothreally is 7 and 1/2 there is afundamental law of exponents which wetalked about in the previous episodethat said 0 to the a times 0 to the Bshould be when you multiply exponentsterms an adding the actual superscript 0to the a plus B well let me apply thisto a particular choice of numbersaccording to this law 0 to the 0 times 0squared should be 0 squared 0 plus 2 allright I claimed 0 0 7 and a half it'sall right seven and a half here timessomething equals something actually I doknow what zero squared is zero squaredis zero times here without a doubt Iknow that's zero so I have here thestatements really saying 7 1/2 timeszero is in fact zero which is actuallyvery true anything times zero zerotherefore 0 to the 0 is indeed 7 and ahalfvoila of course that's a bit of acheaper argument I could have put anynumber there 7 3/4 in fact would havebeen fine since in three quarters times0 is also 0 so I'm afraid actually thisalgebraic statement only muddies thewaters any number could go in for zeroto zero and not contradict thatalgebraic statement so actually offersno help oh so we need to examine 0 to 0in its own right and come and come at itin aWayne so algebraically the C's me knowwill define answer but maybeanalytically there's another approach sowe did see that any number at leastpositive number to the zeroth power is 1for example 1 to the 0 will be 1 andpoint 1 to the 0 will be 1 and pointzero one one-hundredth to the 0 powerwould be 1 and we see where we'reheading this left side wants to become 0to the zeroth power whereas the righthand side is constantly staying thenumber 1 so seems by this argument that0 to the 0 is 1 again but let's coverthis another way 0 to the 1 power is 0 0to the point 1 that is the tenth root of0 is 0that's correct 0 times 0 times 0 10times is indeed 0 so at the 10th root of0 is in fact 0 0 to the point 0 1 it'sthe hundredth root of 0 that's still 0and so on well if I follow this wrotethis again wants to become 0 to the 0but the right hand the sides the righthand side this time is constantlystaying the number 0 so this argumentseems to say the 0 to the 0 wants to be1 so again I have a contradictionalgebraically I had no clear answer andnow analytically it seems I have noclear arts as well let's take anotherperch I don't a graphing calculatorlet's look at this graph y equals x tothe X powerthat's certainly a fine graph if I put xequals 1 or get 1 to the 1 power that isthe answer is 1 I put y equals 2 I'llget 2 to the tooth power which is 4 putin 3 you get 3 to the 3 power which is27 and so on so it certainly is a finegraph but in x equals 1/2 I'll give 1/2to the 1/2 power the square root of 1/2if you actually graph this beast and letme draw it right here either by hand oron a graphing calculator you find thegraph blows up tremendously fast ahscuse me ah blows up tremendously fastfor positive whole numbers but forgetting close to zero it wants to looklike this so the number one turns out tobe here and it looks like zero to thezeroth wants to be one so actually dotry it type this formula into thegraphing calculator and you'll see agraph that looks like this and if I lookvery closely this graph is suggesting atx equals zero y wants to be one wellfine and dandy however if you graph upthe sketches for example sketch thegraph of y equals zero to the X andsketch the graph of y equals x to thezero those two want to be 0 to the 0when x is 0 and I'm afraid they canleave two different pictures so the trueanswer is what is 0 to the 0 it's justsimply undefined there's no answeralgebraically as we saw about that lawsewer to the a times e to the B equals eto the a plus B and there's no answeranalytically one can actually obtainmost any answer one desires but there'sa nice little catalyst question here bythe way look at this graph of y equals xto the X if you look closely does dipdown I'm wondering where this dip iswhere is the lowest value of this graphso for those who know calculus here's myextra challenge for the moment provethat this lowest point occurs at thevalue x equals 1 over e so even though Idon't know how to define 0 to the 0 fromthis graph there's something cruel forcalculus students nonetheless thanksyou
