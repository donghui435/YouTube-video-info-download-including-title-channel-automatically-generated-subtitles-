hello my name is Maria Miller from mathmammoth comm in this video we are goingto study about measuring angles and nowif you watched my other video youhopefully remember how I showed that anangle has to raise and then you open itup the two rays are the two sides of theangle you can open it up like this andthen it will be tracing a circle and anarc of a circle like this okay and tomeasure angles people have agreed thatthe full circle will be 360 degrees andso if your angle opens up let me showyou if your annual opens up at the zeroangle goes all the way over here thenthat would be 360 degrees if it justgoes half that way - straight downmovement at 180 degrees and if it goesup this much it is 90 degrees the rightangle okay and so we measure the anglecomparing to the full circle if itopened up to a full circle it would be360 degrees then if it opens up lessthan that we just compare how much ofthe circle it has drawn here or tracedhere okay compared to the full circlethat's how angles are measured we use aprotractor to measure angles because ithas usually half the circle here markedand it has the numbers for the degreesmine has two sets of numbers and that'susually the case one set of numberstarts here at 0 goes 10 20 30 40 50 etcdown over here to 180 and the other setof number starts here at 0 and goes allthe way here to 180okay so let's say we want to measurethis I know to do that I need toposition the vertex of this angle herein my protractor in certain point okaynow remember that zero is here for myprotractor zero is here and here is myzero line so to speak in your protractorthis might be the zero line you haveif the zero is actually here and then itstarts going off to the numbers and findyour zero line and earn a zero nada isusually a little mark maybe a littlecircle or something where you need toposition the vertex in mind that is nonebut I know that it's the midpoint herewith the number 15 this midpoint here Ineed to position to the vertex and thenI don't need to line up my zero linewith one of these okay oopslike this now it's ready for measuringand then this is how much my angle isopened see from here to here and so Iread now over here on the arc of thecircle it is very near either 70 or 110degrees but you need to know which oneright well here was zero so I read thenumbers that are 0 10 20 30 40 etceteraI read the lower numbers on mine andcome to 70 and this is just a tad morethan that 71 degrees okay and mostprotractors have marks here so you cansee the individual degrees this one justgoes by fives each 5 is marked let'smeasure this angle too so remember Ineed to line up one of these with myzero line but this doesn't work okay nowthis okay this can work yes and thevertex has to be put exactly in thismiddle point here for me it is like thenumber 15 then line line up and okay andnow you can imagine the angle open fromhere to here right so this is how muchof the circle it traces and I again gowith this numbers 10 20 30 somethingthis is my 35 and so it is 37 degreesnow let's say you have to draw an angledraw a 30 60 degree angle okay it willbe very close to this side to start outjust draw a line it's going to be oneside of your endokay that and now park your buttocksthere so if this is my buttocks thenit's going to open up maybe somewherethere okay like this much something likethis in please and now I do the same asif I was measuring the angle I need toline up this with my zero line here andthe vertex with the correct point likethat and now we'll mark over here whereis 36 degreesthat's 30 35 and little over that thatis Secretariat and then I use that markand just draw a line like that otherside of my angle okay now he has draw ahundred and fifty five degree angle nowif you think of this it's going to starthere go up to 90 and past 90 over theresomewhere here it's an obtuse angle wecall animals that are more than 90degrees less than 180 over heresomewhere obtuse angles which means likea doll type of angle was these that areless than 90 are called acute anglesacute angles think of it as a sharpanimal sharp point that could come toyou and you know cut you whateverwhere's the doll type of animal likehere optional won't hurt so much if ifyou were hit with with an object with adolphin so to draw it I have to firststart out by drawing a line again okayand now I know that my angle is going toopen up from here up to 90 and some moreit's going to be someone here rightso again position the zero line of yourprotractor with your line you drew andthen the midpoint here and now I have togo with your past 9220 10 all the way to115 55 over here and draw a mark andthen draw my lineokay so this angle hereit's the 155 angle oh it would taste anarc of a circle from here we often markthe arc of a circle here just a littlearc of a circle okay this is traced arcof a circle up to here but people of themarket nearer the verdicts like thatthat's that I have a triangle and let'stry to measure its angles okayfirst unknown here it's easy it's anacute angle maybe about 40 degrees okayI put my protractor like this and readfrom here this was 0 10 20 30 40it's almost 50 okay 48 degrees up seenext angle now this is where studentshave difficulty is placing theprotractor just right you know where doyou put it now you know okay this has tobe lined up with one of the sides do youline up like this or where you know youneed to remember this midpoint has to beput to the vertex but not like thisbecause then you can't see whether otherside hits all touch is that the wayyou're measuring the angle it needs tobe turn like this for example andthere's two ways I can do it I can putit like this okay vertex at the middleand then the real a line here oh I canline up my zero line with this side ofthe angle like this two ways to do itfor each channel so if I do it like thishere's my zero line and think of openingthe angle it opens a little bit past 90degrees so this is an object and okaythat here over there so 0 10 20 go pastnineteen hundred hundred ten it see it'sbetween 100 110 and so 106 and hereagain okay it might be difficult you seeoh this won't workcan you see whyabout this way now yes it will work okaythis is an acute angle it's not verymuch this is my zero line and it opensup only this far so from zero I'm sorryfrom zero I go now with these topnumbers 10 20 30 almost 30 degrees maybe28 okay and now you probably know thatthe angles in a triangle have to add upto 180 degrees maybe you don't know itbut those of you who know it mightnotice that my numbers don't add up to180 okay because 8 plus 8 is 16 plus 6is 22 but that is because it is sodifficult to measure so accurately toget just you know maybe in reality thisis 47 and 1/2 degrees and I rounded itup maybe this is only 27 degrees orwhatever it's hard to measure accuratelyso don't be alarmed if your some of youI know doesn't get exactly 180 degreesyou
