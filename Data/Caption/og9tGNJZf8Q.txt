okay can we do multiplication withdecimals well yes I mean single digitmultiplication is certainlystraightforward example look at twopoint six one five times seven what isthis well let me draw a picture of a10-1 machine so here's two point six onefive two six one five two one six tenthsone 105 thousands and I say multiplyeverything by seven okay I can do thatso they of having two ones I now havefour teams of them having six tenths andthey'll have forty-two of them's havingone 100th and I'll have seven awesomeand serving five thousand and now have35 of them the answer is 14 point 42 735which is better I think correct justvery weird the society that we know howto fix it up to society example forexplosions here 10 my machine explodedleaving two behind extra four dots thereso I'll get 18 point to this point to735 II and then I can explode three andso onOh actually I was gonna be good exposedto you get 10 there was called anotherexplosion Wowso try it out get the answer and grandwe can actually do very basicmodifications with decimals no worriesactually this is a good example itspeaks to something that confused me asa kid nice going to school let me justclean the board for a moment I'll showyou what I mean alright I'm back let meget the number two point six one fivethis time zero five by seven I'm goingto botfly it by ten so let me draw thepicture of this so I'll draw more boxesnow for my 10 my machinesalright so it's two point six one fiveand everything gets multiplied by afactor of 10 so then every two dots hereand they'll have plenty of them so he's6.0 and I have 60 of them having one dothe'll have ten of them serving five dotshe'll have 50 of them grant now look atthis there's some a special that longmultiplied by ten in a 10-1 machinebecause I got lots of groups of ten andwe know that groups of ten explode butthere's two groups attending explodeKapow kaboom to make two lots there sixdots of six groups of 10 here explodescabal kaboom can throughout Kezia groupgoes up to makesix dots there one explosion group onedot there five explosions because itpulls ghazzal balls Gazoo ball two twoballs two doubles okay bingo and I seethe answer to six one five wow it's thesame digits but the decimal point theysaid is my schooldays moved they said tobe in fact they made me memorize thisrule to multiply by penmanship there's asore point one place to the left orright I can never know which one it isbut the thing is it's not actually thedecimal point it's moving then we hadtwo six one five became 2060 ten fiftyis actually the numbers becauseexplosions shifted over not the decimalpoint it's moving kind of the numbersthat moving anyhow obviously so I'mgoing to take a number it's likebasically two point six like just overtwo and a half and multiply by ten Ishould get something about 20 and halfof ten 26 so I don't need to memorizewhich way the decimal point moves justuse common sense but the thing is I lovethe fact that those rules are oftentaught to memorize in grade schoolactually make sense at a time on machineso multiply by ten you see why all doesit seem to shift multiplied by hundredthey see the shift two places brilliantgrand all right so that's multiplicationlet me now talk about division a littlebit with decimals and that's a littlebit awkward so let me just clean theboard again I'll be right back all rightI'm back so let's try this one is to trysay five divided by 0.3 all right now Imean the answer to here every model thatwe come up with is explainingmathematics is just a model and has itslimitations and tends to break down soit becomes a bit too awkward to reallytry to push it all the way through thefact is I'm a mathematician which meansI don't like hard work and I will workvery hard to avoid hard work so I'mgiven a decimal problem like thisdecimal division problem five divided bypoint three and you say okay I could dodissent in my machine I could draw apicture of five dots in the ones place Ididn't try to make sense of what pointthree of a dot means so be some dot the low what we're expected and I bet Icould make this work I bet I can makethis division problem work the troubleis it hurts my brain when I try to dothat I'm feel free to do it's kind offun but I think there's an easier way tothink about this fact as a visionproblem is really just a fraction I'm itfor maybe that way around a fractionswith the answer to division problem solet me write this as a fractionfive divided by 0.3now some people might object to mehaving non halt numbers for the numeroDominator but that's fine so a fractionI'm good I'm good this is equivalent totwo whole numbers in fact it isequivalent to whole numbers because whenwe do the following I usually don't likethe point three on the bottom that'sthat's what's causing me trouble so I'mgoing to change it to something I don'tlike fix it make it make it make it bedifferent so I'm going to do is multiplythe bottom by 10 and a consequence ofthat sets them off for the top by 10 aswell so it stays the same number whichcase I now see this was rid of thenumber 50 over three because I justlearnt moments ago that multiplying byten well I was told should the decimalpoint was really other way around 50over 350 over 3 now I'm back to one ofthe beginning chapters of the story Ican do that in a 10-1 machine or I cansee the answer is actually going to bewhat 48 and 2/3 so put it divided by 3is 16 and 2/3 bingoso actually my advice is yes you canmake division work with decimals and atailor machine that's all the lot ofbrain power funds the logical exercisebut actually one of the void hard workand turn it back to a problem from anearlier way of doing division back towhole numbers that seems much morenatural and easier to me I could do thatlater my machine for dr. boss if I wantor to see the outputgrand alright so the smart thing is theway to go avoid hard work that workedvery hard to avoid hard work be amathematicianyou
