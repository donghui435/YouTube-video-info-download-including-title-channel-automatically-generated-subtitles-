we're going to look at three examples offactoring trinomials the problem here isthat it can get confusing because youhave more than one variable floatingaround in this trinomial but I ought tostart off this first example here if welook at these three terms again alwayslook for a GCF first all these numbersare even so we can at least pull out a 2anything else there these are not foundin all three terms and we don't see a Fin all three terms so it looks like just- there's gonna be our GCF so if wefactor a 2 out we're left with 25 vsquared + 20 V F + 4 F squared and nowwe can factor this using any of ourshortcuts whether we can recognize thatthis is a perfect square trinomial maybeyou see that maybe you don't and if youdon't see it umlet's look at it as an approach kind oflike what we did with bottoms up don'tworry about all the variables for rightnow let's just suppose the F smartthey're just trying to get you to seehow this could be like a problem similarto what we had done in the past now thisis not the actual problem and again Isaid ignore the F and I'm writing itdown but let's not worry about the Fright now suppose we just had this wegot rid of the F and the F squared if wewere to factor this and if you did notrecognize that this is a perfect squaretrinomial don't worry about it let's dobottoms up so we take 25 times 4 ourproduct is 100 and our sum is equal to20 and the two numbers that work herewill be 10 times 10 that gives us 110plus 10 gives us 20 so what we have donein the past is we just come back andwrite V + 10 V + 10 and we come backwith the number we made disappear againI'm just following that Bottoms Upbottoms up techniqueb25 and then we simplify so we have whatv+ divide these by 5 we have 2/5 and Vplus 2/5 and then we do bottoms up onthis so therefore we have 5 v + 2 v v +2 now let's not forget the GCF we pullit out from the beginning and now whatwe have here is still not the finalanswer and the reason why is because I'mjust I was trying to get you to see thistrinomial without having an F in it butwe have to bring that F back notice thislast term is 4 F squared how could weget for F square down here bymultiplying these last two terms if wejust stuck an F right here and an Fright here - f x 2f is 4 F squared andnotice there's a F here in the middlewell if we were to foil this out andcheck our work notice we will get thetrinomial that we have in here after wefactored our to out check it out 5 V 5 Vthat's 25 B squaredI'm doing these out or two pieces that'sgonna be 10 V F and this is also gonnabe 10 V Fwell there's your 20 V F if you combinelike terms and then there's our 4 Fsquared so again and you run into theseproblems so much you'll get used tomaybe just putting one variable in thefirst time the V and the V in each ofthose first terms and you'll put that Fthere in the last term of each of thosebinomials but let's go one step furthersince this is a perfect square our finalanswer will be 2 times 5 V + 2 F squarednow that might take some practice justto almost kind of like guess and checkso to speak when I just stuck those sback in there but you'll do it so muchwhere to become a habitjust like when I first probably showedyou bottoms up it was like whoa that'scrazy but it becomes habit and that'swhat will happen here as wellso there's our answer to that one thesecond one here again always look forGCF first twenty four thirty and nine wecan at least pull a three outlet's see all these terms have these andI'm to don't theywe've got a V to the fourth V cubed Vsquared so we can at least pull out a Vsquared you separate this stuff so thatleaves us with eight V squared plus 10 VB and minus three will put out the Vsquared so we just have a B squared nowlike I said in the first example you'llget used to doing these and notice theV's and the bees here kind of like theV's and the FS over here we have the Vsquared V squared F squared here's our Bsquared and then we have the V be likewe have the V F so you'll get used toseeing them set up by that so let's dobottoms up our product is negative 24our sum is 10 so those two numbers thatwork there are negative 6 and negative 4because negative snows not negative 6and negative 4 it's gonna be negative 12and 2 how about a positive 12 and anegative 2 that's what we want to usebecause a positive 12 times a negative 2it does give us a negative 24 and apositive 12 minus 2 does give us at 10so you got to play around with yournumbers sometimes to get that to workout now whether you want to bring the Vdown or whatever here kind of like I wasjust showing you the bottoms up pieceback here I'm going to come back in andjust stick those B's and kind of likehow I went back and just stuck those Fsin while ago so we have using bottomsupv + 12 v minus 2 remember to bring the 8backwhen we simplify we have v+ dividingthese by four we get three halves anddividing these by two we get 1/4 bringyour two up bring you four up and don'tforget to bring your 3b squared down sowe have 3b squared pulling that two upwe have two V plus three stick yourbeing and then we have four V minus oneor we can just go ahead and say minus Band if you were to multiply all thisstuff back out you would go right backto the very beginning notice these twobinomials let's multiply those realquick in our head - V times four V iseight V squared this is plus 2v B or B Vhowever you want to call that - V Bthat's going to be I said plus that's me- 2 VV + 12 V B that's how we get thatpositive 10 V B there and then 3 B timesnegative B is negative 3 B squared andthen with this 3v squared obviously wecan just distribute that back up hereand make sure we get what we startedwith and we will now these first twoexamples had GCS and I'm not everyproblems going to have a GCF so in thiscase here we can actually jump straightinto bottoms up notice we have x squaredY squared kind of like how we had the Vsquared F squared and then the XY in themiddle kind of like how we had the V airfor the V be in the middle bottoms uphere 4 times negative 25 our product isone of B negative 100 our sum is equalto negative 15 so the two numbers thatwork here will be negative 20 and apositive 5 because if you multiply thosetwo numbers you get negative 100 if youadd those two numbers you get negative15so we can come back and write this as Xminus 20 and X plus 5 computer isgetting a little slow I don't forget todivide by 4 so we have X minus 5 when wesimplify and we can't simplify this sowe just bring the 4 up we have 4x plus 5and now we don't want to leave theanswer like this because we need to getthat Y squared at the end so just comeback and stick in those Y's no that's itfor that one if you were to foil thatback out x times 4 X is 4x squared xtimes 5 y is plus 5 XY and this is minus20 XY so plus 5xy minus 20 X Y gives usthat negative 15 XY and then negative 5ytimes positive 5 y is negative 25 ysquared so it does work out so yeahthese take a little bit more it's stillusing bottoms up which we've talkedabout quite a bit it's just a matter ofremembering you GCF sometimes and thenmaybe coming back and just stickingthose variables in here at the end ofthe problem well that's it for thisvideo hope in hell
