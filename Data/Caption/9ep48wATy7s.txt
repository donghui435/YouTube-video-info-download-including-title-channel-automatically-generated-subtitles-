what's so special about the area of anequilateral triangle to get to its areawe need to understand a few conceptsfirst all sides of the equilateraltriangle are equal to each other and soare the angles all sides equal and allangles equal so if we assume each angleto be x degrees then three X would equal180 degrees as the sum of angles of atriangle is always 180 degrees eachangle will measure 60 degrees but againthe question is how do we get to thearea look at this equilateral trianglewith sides s if we drop a perpendicularfrom a vertex onto its opposite side itwill divide it into two equal parts thislength will be s pi/2 and this length aswell will be s pi/2 this concept holdstrue even for an isosceles triangle hereif we drop a perpendicular to this sidethen these two lengths will be equalboth will equal Y by two so in atriangle when we have two equal sidesand we drop a perpendicular from thevertex joining the two equal sides toits opposite side then that oppositeside is divided into two equal parts nowwe can move on to the area of anequilateral triangle look at thisequilateral triangle with sides s theperpendicular divides the side into twoequal parts let this height be H nowlook at the figure closely we need tofind the area of this equilateraltriangle only in terms of its side itmeans we need to find its area in termsof s how can we do thatthink about it we know that the area canbe written as one half base times itsheight the base is already in terms of snow if we manage to get the height H interms of s our life will becomenot easier now how can we get a CH interms of s look at this right trianglefor instance can be used the Pythagorastheorem to get H in terms of s let's seewe can say that s squared is equal to Hsquared plus s by 2 squared the squareof the hypotenuse is equal to the sum ofthe squares of the other two sidessolving this we get H as root 3 by 2times s now we have H in terms of s thebasic formula for the area of a triangleis one half base times the height thatwill be half the base is s and theheight is root three by two times ssolving this further we get the area ofan equilateral triangle as root three byfour times s squared that's our formulato find the area of an equilateraltriangle all we need is the length ofone of its sides we can substitute ithere and get the area of course you arenot expected to know this derivation butjust in case you forget the area youwill know how to derive it quickly alsoremember that when these two sides areequal a perpendicular drop to the thirdside divides it into two equal parts
