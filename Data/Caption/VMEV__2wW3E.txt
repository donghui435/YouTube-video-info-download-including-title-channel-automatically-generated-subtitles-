So they tell us that Hiram
solved the equation, 5 plusthe square root of x plus 14
is equal to x plus 7, usingthe following steps.Let's see what he did.He subtracted 5 from
both sides.Yeah, that's reasonable
enough.That got that 5 out
of the way.And then 7 minus 5 is 2.And then he squared
both sides.The square root of x plus 14
squared is just x plus 14.That makes sense.And x plus 2 squared is
x plus 2 squared.And then he uses the pattern for
square binomials to expandthe right-hand side.OK, so he just multiplied out
x plus 2, times x plus 2, toget x squared plus 4x, plus 4.Then he subtracted x plus 14
from both sides, so he gets a0 on the left-hand side.So when you take x from
4x, you get 3x.When you take 14 from 4
you get negative 10.So that all makes sense.Then he factored the
right-hand side.Let's see, 5 times negative
2 is negative 10.5 plus negative 2 is 3.That makes sense.Then he uses a 0 product
propertyto solve the equation.That's just this property--
look, if you have two thingsand you take their product and
it equals 0, one or both ofthem must be equal to 0.So that means x plus 5 is equal
to 0, or x minus 2 isequal to 0.And so if x plus 5 is equal
to 0, that's x is equal tonegative 5.x is equal to 2 of 0, that's
x is equal to 2.Let me just write
that down here.So all he did in this step
is he says, x plus5 is equal to 0.Or x minus 2 is equal to 0.From this you get this right
over here, because yousubtract 5 from both sides.And then from this you get
that right over there.Then he checked both answers.He substituted negative 5 into
the original equation.So he substituted negative
5 in there.It shows up twice.5 plus the square root of
negative 5, plus 14 is equalto negative 5 plus 7.Let's see what else he did.Then this becomes square
root of 9.This becomes 2.Then you get 5 plus 3 is equal
to 2, which is false.This is not true.And he wrote that down.And then he tried out 2.His other solution.When you substitute 2 you get
2 plus 14, which is 16.2 plus 7 is 9.Square root of 16 is 4.And this is the principal root
of 16 we're talking about, sowe're taking the positive
square root.And then 5 plus 4
is equal to 9.So this works out.And then he says that
the answer is xequals 2, which is right.Now this whole exercise, all
they want us to know is, isthis an example of deductive
reasoning?Explain.And it is an example of
deductive reasoning.He started off with a known
statement, with a known-- wecould call that a known
fact-- if we assumethat that's a fact.He started off with that.And just doing logical
operations, he was able todeduce, step by step,
he was able tomanipulate other truths.He started with a fact and using
logical operations hewas able to come up
with other facts.And go all the way down here
and then check his answers,and eventually come up with
the notion that if this istrue, then this must
also be true.So that is deductive
reasoning.You start with facts, use
logical steps or operations,or logical reasoning to come
up with other facts.He's not estimating.He's not generalizing.He's not assuming some
trend will continue.He started with something he
knows is true and gets tosomething else he
knows is true.And this is a bit of a review.You're probably wondering
why thenegative 5 wasn't a solution.And as a little bit of a hint
here-- and I'll let you thinkabout why it didn't end up as a
solution-- when we took thesquare root of 9 here, we took
the positive square root.And when anyone just says a
square root like that, thatmeans the positive
square root, theprincipal square root.But if we were to take the
negative square root here,this equation would
have held up.Because 5 plus negative
3 is equal to 2.So I'll let you think about at
what step of this equationwould a negative number
have worked?And it has something
to do with whenwe square both sides.But that has nothing to do with
the actual question athand, so I'll leave you there.We explained it before,
in the past. So thiswas deductive reasoning.
