the orthocenter is the point where allthree altitudes of the triangle meetinstead of finding where all three ofthe altitudes mean I can find where twoof the altitudes me and that will be myorthocenteran altitude is a line perpendicular tothe base through the opposite vertex sousing this as my base I'm going to findthe line that is perpendicular throughthat from the opposite vertex which isthis point so using the opposite vertexas a point of reference I'm going toopen up my compass and make it hit thebase twice once I find the two points ofintersectionI can change my compass and make an Xand drawing the line through theopposite vertex through the X here is myfirst altitude which is perpendicular tofind another altitude I'll use thissegment of the side of the triangle asmy base opening up the compass from theopposite vertex so that it hits thatbase twiceyou change my compass link now usingthat same compass light for both pointsof intersectionI now have created this X lining that upwith the opposite vertex I draw myseconds altitude which is alsoperpendicular to that base where thosetwo altitudes meet is my orthocenter
