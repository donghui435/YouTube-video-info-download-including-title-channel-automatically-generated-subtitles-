constructing the orthocenter of atriangle now and the orthocenter is theintersection of the three altitudes ofthe triangle so we need to constructthree altitudes from this triangle solet's start with this top vertex herenow remember to construct an altitudeyou have to position your compass on thevertex and you need to cut an arc thatwill intersect that opposite signtwo times okay and there we go now fromthose two intersection points you needto make an X with your arcs from both ofthem and connecting your vertex to thatpoint will give you your first altitudenow because I do not know where thataltitude is going to intersect I amgoing to make this altitude quite longokay now let's go ahead and move on tothis vertex right here you see that itneeds to reach the opposite side righthere but we're going to have to extendthat side because it's we cannot make analtitude without it because we can't geta 90-degree angle thereall right so I'm going to extend thatsideand then we repeat the same processso put our compass here we need to cutthis twice I should probably make that alittle bigger okay so our twointersection points are here and hereand we need to mark those out with arcsto create an X and then we connect thevertex to that intersection point wehave created an altitude do you see howwe meet at a 90 degree angle therealright let's go for the third now weneed to head from this side our pictureis getting a little bit messy so we'regoing to clean it up just a little bitso we don't get confused by the marksthat we have okay so from this vertex weneed to hit the opposite side here onceagain we're going to need to extendtake our compass and cut an art okayfrom those two intersection points okaywe need to cut another arc and create anX okay if we connect the vertex throughthat intersection pointthere's our altitude right there and ifyou see all three of these altitudesintersect in one central point okaythat central point is copy orthocenter
