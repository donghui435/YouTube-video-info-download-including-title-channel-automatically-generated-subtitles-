okay in this video I'm going to do someexamples about factoring the differenceof two squares sometimes people will sayit's factoring the difference of twoperfect squares and the formula thatwe're going to use it basically says ifyou have something squared minussomething squared you can put that inparenthesis by just taking the thingsthat are being squared in one set ofparentheses make it a minus and theother set make it a plus that's all yougot to do be very careful if you have asquared plus B squaredif the exponents are squares thisdoesn't factor you can't do anything atall to this so people will often try tomake it do something somehow factor itbut it's not correct so be very carefulabout thatif the exponents are both threes it doesfactor in that case so just some youknow little nuances that to be aware ofbut anyway okay so just a couple basicexamples here 9x squared - 49 and then36 y to the fourth - 100all you have to do and we can evenrewrite it first we want something wewant to rewrite the first term issomething squared well to write 9 assomething squared we would need a 3 andthen to get x squared we just need an Xso if you multiply 3x by 3x we get 9squared and then 49 we can write that as7 squaredI typically skip this step on a sleepbut just to illustrate so this is our athis is our B and hey it says we have asquared minus B squared well n factorsit says we take a which is 3x and itdoesn't matter the order in which youput the negative and the positivein the parentheses so we'll take 3xminus 7 and 3x plus 7 and now we have itfactored so typically what I always dokind of a shortcut for me at least theway I think about it anytime I seesomething with two terms so here's oneterm here's the other term if there's aminus in between them it always factorsbasically I just take the square root ofthe first term which I guess you knowmaybe maybe you've seen it a squareroots a little bit maybe haven't workedwith them a lot but the square root of9x squared would just be 3x and 3x andthe square root of 49 will just be sevenand seven and then I just stick a minusand a plus in between them so maybe wecan do kind of the same idea on this one36 y to the fourth minus 100 so Irecognize there's two terms there's aminus in between so I say hey that'sgoing to factor I think what numbertimes itself is 36 well I would need a 6and a 6 what would I have to multiply byitself to get Y to the fourth we wouldneed Y squared + y squared and then Ithink we'll what number multiply what'ssquare root of 100 it's just going to be10and then I just take a negative in apositive inside of there and again now Ihave it factored okay so nothing nothingworse than that again you can distributethese out and make sure in fact thateverything cancels out and you do getthis original expression back
