So say you're Arthur
Stone, and you'reshowing your hexaflexagon
to your friend, Tuckerman,and you've already blown
his mind by showing himit has three sides-- orange,
yellow, pink, orange, yellow,pink-- but now you're
about to extra super blowhis mind by showing him that
there's even more colors.And he's like, whoa, where
did the blue side come from?But you're having
trouble finding all six.Like, you know there's a
green side somewhere in here,but where is it?You're all like, OK, Tuckerman,
I think I found the green side.It's right in here.Anyway, Tuckerman
immediately decideshe needs to discover
the fastest wayto get to all the colors,
which he calls the Tuckermantraverse.So you and Tuckerman
are working on that,and there's hexaflexagons
all over the lunch table,and another student is curious
about what you're doingand wants to join
your committee.His name is Richard Feynman.So stop being Arthur Stone, and
start being Brian Tuckerman.So you're Tuckerman,
and you teach Feynmanhow to make the
hexa-hexaflexagonby first folding a strip of
18 triangles with the 19thfor gluing.You and Stone have just
figured out how to numberthe faces before you
fold them by dissectinga perfect specimen.You number them 1-2-3, 1-2-3,
1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3.Glue on one side.Flip it, and glue 4, 4, 5, 5,
6, 6, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 4, 4, 5,5, 6, 6 on the other.You coil it around so
that you get ones and twosand threes on the outside like
1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1 2, 2, 3, 3,and then fold that
around into a hexagon,so that all the twos
are on the front.And then flip it, and glue
the two blue parts together,so that all threes
are on the back.Feynman has some
trouble flexing it,but you show him how to pinch
two triangles together and thenpush in the opposite side.He somehow still does it wrong
and ends up doing it backwards,flexing in reverse.Now he's all intrigued by all
the flexing possibilities,and you're like, let me show
you the Tuckerman traverse.But Feynman, being Feynman, is
like, we must create a diagram.And Tuckerman's like,
really, it's not that hard.No, diagram.So you're Feynman,
and you've alreadyseen you can cycle from one to
two to three, one, two, three.So you write that down
with arrows and stuff.Or you can go backwards, but
from one, two, and three, youcan also flex the other way,
in which case one goes to six,or two to five,
or three to four.And if you did one to
six, once you're at six,you can only flex one way,
because the other doesn't work.You have to go to three
or backwards back to one.But then you notice
that if you go to three,you can only flex one way, and
the other is un-open-up-able.But before when
you were on three,you could go either
to one or four,but now you can only go to one.And you can go backwards
to six, but notbackwards to two, which
means that this three isn'tthe same three as
the first three.Somehow it's the same color,
but in a different state.You show this to your
friend John Tukey,and he's like, oh
yeah, that makes sense.And he draws a star in
the middle of your threeand sits back as if that
explained everything.So you're like, whatever,
and flip it back aroundto get to the other
three and check it.The star turns into a not star.And from this alternate
three, there'sthis 1-6-3 loop that connects
to the main loop at one, whichis the same one as
one has always been.But there's a different
one off of the main twoin the 2-5-1 loop.And of course, everything looks
different if you flip it over.And these threes
are also different,because they have different
numbers on the other side.And you complete a
diagram of possibilities,which allows you to find the
optimal Tuckerman traverse.You also diagram the
original trihexaflexagon,which is pretty simple.The flexagon committee
approves your diagramsand decides to call
them Feynman diagrams.Everything is going
great until 1941,because suddenly there's
important war stuff to do,and flexagons are
largely forgotten.OK.Now fast forward 15 years,
and be Martin Gardner.You're an amateur
magician, and you'rehanging out at
your friend's placetalking about magician stuff.Anyway your friend
shows you somethingyou've never seen before--
a big flexagon he'smade out of cloth.And you're thinking,
hey, this is awesome.Maybe other people would like to
know about this flexagon thing.So you write an article
for Scientific American,and soon you've landed yourself
a gig writing a regular columnabout recreational mathematics
called "Mathematical Games,"and it's a huge success and
gets hundreds of comments.I mean, letters, and there's
nothing else like your column.And all the cool people
are inspired by you,and you're pretty
much the reasonwhy people know about
things like tangrams,and Conway's Game of Life,
and the work of MC Escher,and other things like that.Now fast forward 50
years, and say you'reme in the generation of people
inspired by Martin Gardnerare now the people
inspiring you.So he's your math
inspiration grandfather.And now you yourself are in
the business of mathematicallyinspiring people,
and you want themto be aware of their math
inspiration heritage.OK, now say you are you.If you think
hexaflexagons are coolthat was just column number one.And I invite you to join in
with the hundreds of peopleto celebrate Martin Gardner's
birthday every October 21.This year, there
will be hexaflexagonparties in homes and
schools all over the world.And if you want to
attend or host one,check the description.I'm celebrating by
making these videos,and also I just like the image
of flexagons everywhere--floating around lunch tables,
spilling out of your pockets,lost in your couch cushions.I like to keep some
ready to deploy outof my wallet or
tiny yellow purse,in case of a flexagon emergency.And then there's more
recent innovationsin flexagon technology, and
all the cool ways to colorthem, and other stuff.But that will have to
wait until next time.
