[MUSIC PLAYING]My goal is to not actually
do any measurementsother than using pie.So the entire thing is
going to pie based.We get the circumference in
the exact number of pies--give or take-- we get the
diameter in number of pies.Divide one by the other,
we get pi.[MUSIC PLAYING]Pi was historically rarely
calculated this way, becauseit's notoriously inaccurate
to try and get--I know, we're idiots-- it's
notoriously inaccurate to tryand calculate pi by measuring
a circle.[MUSIC PLAYING]To get any kind of accuracy on
our final answer we have to beas precise as we can be.[MUSIC PLAYING]This is a mild problem, because
I want to go from thevery edge of the circle.But as you can see, I've
positioned all the piesexactly on the line as if
they're little mini tangents.So I'm going to have to move
these two out and then I canstart doing the diameter exactly
on the circumferencethere, like that.[MUSIC PLAYING]So that's 84 and 1/3.264 and 2/3 pies around,
we have the diameter,is 84 and 1/3 pie.To get pi, we just divide the
circumference by the diameter.OK, and if we actually work out
what that is, it equals--that's pretty good.Pi from pies, we got 3.13834,
which is approximately 3.14.So using pies, we've
got pi to be 3.14.I am a very happy
man right now.With the diameter, and if I know
that ratio, I can justmeasure the diameter.That's the easy bit
to measure.The center point will
be my pen, and theoutside will be the chalk.So the pies, in theory, are
a fairly consistent size.So they're all--yeah they're about the same.OK.[MUSIC PLAYING]
