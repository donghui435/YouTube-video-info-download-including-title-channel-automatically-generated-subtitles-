this is a plain sheet of paper which istwo-dimensional and this is a table witha flat topif this paper is kept on the table itwill occupy some place on the table inshort it will occupy some place on aplain surface now look at this cuboid itoccupies three-dimensional spacesomething more than just a plain thisspace that the cuboid takes up is calledits volume its entire surface cannot lieon a plane at once how do we find itsvolume to understand that we need tounderstand that every cuboid is made upof tiny little cubes the volume of thislittle cube is one centimeter cubed orone cubic centimeter each edge is equaland is one centimeter in length and thisis the standard unit for measuringvolume of small solids if this bigcuboid is made up of 20 such littlecubes then its volume would be 20 cubiccentimeters if it is made up of 10 suchstandard cubes it will be 10 cubiccentimeters we will understand betterwith more examples look at this board onits base it has many white squares eachof site 1 centimeter let's also assumeall the cubes which we will see have avolume of one cubic centimeter and usingthese one cubic centimeter cubes we willbuild cuboid and cubes and find theirvolumes let us form a cuboid first weadd 6 red cubes of 1 cubic centimeter onthe board this forms a cuboid andbecause it is made up of 6 little cubesits volume will be 6 cubic centimetersnow let's modify this cuboid a bit ontop of it we add 6 standard yellow cubesof volume 1 cubic centimeter what we seeon the board again is a cuboid it12 cubes and all six yellow and six redso it's volume is 12 cubic centimetersnow here's something interesting this isa cuboid with length 3 centimetersbreadth 2 centimeters and height 2centimeters 3 multiplied by 2 multipliedby 2 also gives us 12 cubic centimetersfocus well we're getting closer to theformula 3 multiplied by 2 is the area ofthe base so the volume of a cuboidactually equals the area of its basemultiplied by its height it can also bewritten as length multiplied by breathmultiplied by height let us test thisformula we add 6 green cubes on topthis is still a cuboid its height isthree centimeters length is threecentimeters and breadth is twocentimeters there are two ways to findits volume first count the number ofcubes and second use the formula it hassix red six yellow and six green 18cubes in all each of one cubiccentimeter because there are 18 cubes ofone cubic centimeter the volume will be18 cubic centimeters now let's see ifthe formula works area of the base is 3centimeters multiplied by 2 centimetersand the height is 3 centimeters 3centimeters multiplied by 2 centimetersmultiplied by 3 centimeters also givesus 18 cubic centimeters the formulaworks finehere's one last example let's try adding9 cubes at the side three red ones threeyellow ones and three green ones andguess what we get a cube in this cubethere are 27 little standard cubes sothe volume of this cube is 27 cubiccentimeters and 3 multiplied by 3 whichis the area of the base multiplied by 3which is the height also gives us 27cubic centimeters
