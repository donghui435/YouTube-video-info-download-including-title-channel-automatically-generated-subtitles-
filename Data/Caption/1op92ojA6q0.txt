In which quadrant is the point
negative 7 comma 7 located?So let's just review
what a quadrant is.A quadrant are each
of the four sectionsof the coordinate plane.And when we talk
about the sections,we're talking about the sections
as divided by the coordinateaxes.So this right here is the
x-axis and this up-down axisis the y-axis.And you can see it
divides a coordinate planeinto four sections.We call each of these
sections quadrants.This one over here, where both
the x-values and the y-valuesare positive, we call
the first quadrant.And we use the Roman numeral I.Then if we kind of
move counterclockwisearound the coordinate
plane, this quadrant wherethe x-values are negative and
the y-values are positive,we call this the
second quadrant.I could write it.We call this the
second quadrant.Then we go down here where
both the x-values are negativeand the y-values are negative.We call this the third
quadrant, once againusing Roman numerals.Then finally the quadrant
where the x-values are positivebut the y-values
are negative, wecall this the fourth quadrant.So let's see which quadrant
the point negative 7 comma7 is located.So there's two ways
to think about it.You could just say, look,
we have a negative x-value.Our x-value is
negative, so we'regoing to move to the left.So we're going to
be on this side.We're going to be on
this side right hereof the coordinate plane.Just by the fact that
the x-value is negative,we're going to be either in the
second or the third quadrant.Now, we know that the
y-value is positive.We know that the
y-value is positive.So if the x-value is negative
and the y-value is positive,we're going to land
someplace right over herein the second quadrant.The other way to
think about it is youcould literally
just plot this pointand see that it falls
in the second quadrant.So let's do that.If x is negative 7.So that's negative 1, negative
2, negative 3, negative 4,negative 5, negative
6, negative 7.Did I do that right?1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6, 7.So this is x is negative 7.And then we have to
go up 7 because yis equal to positive 7.So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7.So the point negative 7
comma 7 is right over here,clearly lies in the
second quadrant.
