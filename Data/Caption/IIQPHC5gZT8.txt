remember scientific notation whereinstead of having to write a whole bunchof zeros we'd express maybe a very largenumber as something like 5 point 4 2times 10 to the 19th how do we determinehow many significant figures are in anumber like this expressed in scientificnotation well you know what it's notthat hardit's really easy and all we have to dois completely ignore this 10 raised tothe exponent the only thing we want todo is want to pay attention to this parthere which we call a mantissa that Ididn't make that up that it's actually aword you can you know you can look it upbut so all we want to do is concentrateour energy on the mantissa here okayso five point four to all of them arenonzero digits which means that thisnumber has three significant figuresthat's it we don't pay any attention tothe ten raised to the 19th we just wecross it off when we're looking at howmany significant figures a scientificnotation expression has okay similarlylet's say we had seven point one zerozero times ten auto no to the negativeeight again we don't worry at all aboutthe 10 raised to the power we look onlyat the mantissa we look at the mantissaseven point one zero zero the zeros aresignificant because they're to a rightto the right of a decimal place so foursignificant figures in the mantissawhich means that there are only foursignificant figures in this number donot let this tend to the whatever powerconfuse you all you have to do is lookat the number on the right okay so let'stake a look at how we do some mathproblems with significant figures inscientific notation okay here is adivision problem we do a division andmultiplication the same way okay I'mjust going to do one example so here wedo on 2.0 times ten to the twelfthdivided by nine point eight point threethree times ten to the eighth as we'vesaid before in scientific notation thefirst thing we want to do is we want tobreak this problem down into two smallerproblems okay the first thing we'regoing to do is we're going to take 2.0and divide it by 8 pointthree zero okay so 2.0 divided by eightpoint three three zero and when I dothat math I get zero point two four zerozero nine six okaythat's the first part of this nowsignificant figures how do we round thiswe pay attention only to the significantfigures that are in the mantises ofthese number okay so two point zero twosignificant figures eight point threethree zero zero coming to the right of adecimal place four significant figureswe round to the lower number of these sozero point two four remember this isn'tsignificant because it's coming to theleft of a decimal place so we don't haveto worry about that point two four I'mgoing to keep these we're going to lookto the right do I keep the same aroundup it's zero so I keep it the same zeropoint 2 4 is our answer rounded to twosignificant figures and remember when Idid this and the route when I did itsignificant figures here and then themath and then the rounding I didn't payany attention to these 10 to the 12 10to the eight doesn't have anything to dowith it okay now for the second part ofthe division equation we are going tolook at the 10s raised to the power sowe going to do 10 to the 12th divided by10 to the 8th when we divide numbers wesubtract their exponents so we do 12minus 8 which is going to going to giveus 4 so the answer to this divisionproblem is going to be 10 to the 4thokay and again we don't worry at allabout significant figures when we'redoing this half of the problem so isthis going to be our final answer0.2 4 times 10 to the 4th it's notbecause if you remember correctscientific notation is always writtenwhere we have one digit and then thedecimal place and then all the otherdigits so we want to have one digit tothe left of the decimal here we don'thave any important digits to the left ofthe decimal I have a zero so what is nowzero point two four we want to changethis to two point four in order to dothat I have to take the decimal placeand move it over one spot to the rightwhen I move decimal places over to theright I take the exponent of 10 and Imove it down so since this was one spotI'm gonna go from 10 to the fourth onedown to 10 to the third now my answer isincorrectscientific notation and it also has thecorrect number of scientific it also hasthe correct number of significantfigures okay so just to quickly recapwhat we did we did the division here wepaid attention scientific note to twosignificant figuresjust like we normally would and in doingthis rounding we paid no attention tothe ten to the twelfth intended don'tlet it confuse you it's not important atall just do the division or themultiplication it's the same just likeyou would any other problem and then addon the ten to the whatever power afteryou finish it off figure it out at theend okay so this is division the samewould be true for multiplication let'slook at addition and subtraction becausethey have some differentsignificant figures rules now inscientific notation when we're adding orsubtracting numbers the powers of tenhave to be the same and you can see thathere 10 to the fourth here 10 to thefourth here that means we can just addthem up as we said before we're going tobreak this into two different problemsthe first thing I'm going to do is topoint one one three plus nine point twookay add this up do the math three onethree eleven okay remember the rules foraddition and subtraction withsignificant figures are somewhatdifferentI find which of these numbers here hasthe fewest places after the decimal it'shere it's that nine point two whichmeans that I draw a line right next tothis and this shows me where I'm goingto round I keep the three I look to theone do I keep it the same around up it'sa 1 so I keep it the same eleven pointthree is this first half of the equationI paid attention to scientifically Ipaid attention to significant figureshere and I didn't pay any attention tothe tens raise the power when I did thispartokay since its addition the distantsubtracting the same we just keep thisten to the fourth we don't change it allwe don't like add it we don't subtractit's just ten to the fourth we startedwith ten to the fourth is what we end upwith only for addition and subtractionokay so here's the answer that we get isthis correct scientific notation no it'snot because we want to have one digitdecimal blah-blah-blah-blah-blah soeleven point three I want to change thisto one point one three in order to dothat I mean I have to take the decimalplace move it over one spot to the leftnow when we move a decimal place to theleft it means we take the exponent on 10and we increase it in this case we movethe decimal place one spot over so weincrease ten to the fourth up by onespot to ten to the fifth and now here ismy final answer incorrect scientificnotation and rounded to the correctnumber of significant figures so we justwe do the math addition subtractionmultiplication division just like wewould any other problem paying attentionto significant figures not worrying itall about the 10 to the whatever powerround it and then we make sure that ourfinal answer is incorrect scientificnotation but that is scientific notationand significant figures
