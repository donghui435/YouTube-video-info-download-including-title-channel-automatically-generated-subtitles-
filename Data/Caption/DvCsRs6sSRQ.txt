hey everyone and welcome to this shortlesson where we're going to compare theangle side angle and angle angle sidetriangle congruence theoremsso we can start with a quick recap ofthe angle-side-angle theorem if twotriangles are congruent byangle-side-angle then we have acongruent angle as well as a congruentside and another congruent angle in bothtriangles now again notice that forangle side angle the side is in betweenin the middle of the two anglesand now by completing the triangle usingthose two angles we can see why theangle-side-angle theorem would provethat two triangles are congruentnow for the angle-angle-side trianglecongruence theorem we still have twoangles and one side it's just the orderthat's going to change so in bothtriangles we have one congruent angleand then another congruent angle andthen our congruent side is after thosetwo consecutive angles here so you havetwo angles in a row and then aside nextto them and so now by completing thistriangle we can see why theangle-angle-side theorem proves that twotriangles are congruent now since thesetwo theorems are so similar it's a verycommon mistake for students to mix themup all theorems contain two congruentangles as well as one congruent sideangle side angle has two congruentangles with the side in between thoseangles just like it's written the S isin between the two A's angle-angle-sidehas two congruent angles but in thiscase they are consecutive and the sidecomes after that so we have twocongruent angles in a row and then asideso take a second to visualize this soyou don't confuse these two theoremsagain they both have two angles in oneside but it's the location of the sidethat will help you to determine whichtheorem to use see ya thanks a lot guysfor checking us out and please follow uson Instagram at Nash up map for dailymath tips animated flashcards and ourmath in sports and infographics check itout
