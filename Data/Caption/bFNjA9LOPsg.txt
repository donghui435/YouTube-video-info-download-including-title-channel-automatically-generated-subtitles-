DR. JAMES GRIME: Have you ever
heard of the time when theytried to redefine pi,
to redefine piso that it was 3.2?BRADY HARAN: I'm about to.DR. JAMES GRIME: Yes, you are.This is absolutely insane.It's a true story, as well.And it's absolutely crazy.So this happened--well, I don't think
that long ago.It was 1897.And there was a guy called Edwin
Goodwin, this amateurmathematician who thought he had
solved one of the unsolvedproblems of mathematics, a
problem that goes way back toancient Greece.It was called squaring
the circle.The problem is can you find a
square that has the same areaas a circle.So this problem goes
way, way back.And it's a favorite problem for
amateur mathematicians.And this guy thought he had
solved the problem.But implicitly in his proof,
he had assumed that pi wasexactly 3.2.Now, he was so pleased with
his proof, he wanted tocopyright the proof itself so
that anyone using the prooffrom that point on would have
to pay him royalties.But he decided that the great
state of Indiana--which is where he was from--
that the educationalestablishments of Indiana
could use it for free.How kind of him.And so what he did was he
had a bill made up.And he tried to pass it into law
that would recognize themathematical truth that
he had discovered.But it would allow Indiana
to use it for free.Though I think he had a friend,
someone he knew, whowas part of the House of
Representatives in Indiana.And he made up this bill
saying that the greatmathematical truth of
squaring the circle.Now, this bill went through
committees.It went through the Education
Committee in the House ofRepresentatives.And they obviously didn't know
what they were doing, becausethey passed the bill.And the representatives
actually passed itunanimously, 67 to 0.They passed it.Now, this is the weird bit.On the same day that they were
passing the bill, there was amathematician in the building.He was there for a completely
different reason.He was a guy called
Professor Waldo.But he decided to sit in on
what they were discussing,because it was about math.So he was interested.And he couldn't believe
what he was hearing.They invited him to meet
Edwin Goodwin.Oh, do you want to meet Edwin?We're very proud of him.He said, no, I meet enough crazy
people as it is, thankyou very much.So this mathematical professor
then decidedto coach the Senate.The next thing that happens is
the bill goes from the Houseof Representatives
to the Senate.So this professor coached the
senators so that they knewwhat they were doing.By this time, the newspapers
had heard of it.They were mocking what
was going on.So when it reached the Senate,
they threw it out.They threw it out not before
having a bit of fun with it.They had about half an hour
of maths puns andmaking jokes about it.Then they threw it out.But seriously, there
are solutions--"solutions"--to squaring the circle, where
you take really goodapproximations to pi.More serious mathematicians--for example, Ramanujan, who was
an Indian mathematician,and a brilliant one at that--he had a solution
to this as well.So Ramanujan came up with an
approximation which meant thatif you made a circle with an
area of 140,000 square miles,then you could have a square
with the same area.And the sides of the square
would be off just by an inch.So Edwin Goodwin had
done this in 1897.And you can see the documents.It's absolutely true,
this story.You can look at the documents
yourself.You can read it.And it's a strange thing
to happen, as well.Because the problem he was
trying to solve, squaring thecircle, was proved to
be impossible 15years earlier, in 1882.So I think we should have a
video about squaring thecircle and what it means.BRADY HARAN: Shall we do that?DR. JAMES GRIME: Shall
we do that?BRADY HARAN: We'll film that.We're about to film it now.Tune in soon.And we'll show you about
squaring the circle.DR. JAMES GRIME: Let's have a
look at what you can do withrules and compasses.You can add numbers.Look.Here's a line.And it has length a.Then I add another
line of length b.And the whole thing
is a plus b.
