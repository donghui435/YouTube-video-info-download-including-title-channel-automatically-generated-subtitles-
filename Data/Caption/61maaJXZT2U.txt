there are two properties when we'retalking about circles that are easilyconfused arc length versus arc measureto compare arc length in arc measurelet's look at some concentric circleslet's say I drew in two radii in thesmaller circle and I called thatintercepted arc arc a let's say Iextended those radii all the way out tothe larger circle and I'm gonna callthat arc B so again we're trying tocompare arc measure with arc length andI see that since it has the same centralangle since our K and arc B have thesame central angle I could say that themeasure the arc measure of a is equal tothe arc measure of B but if we look atthe distance between the interceptedarcs endpoints we can see pretty clearlythat the length Elyon GTH of arc a isdefinitely smaller than the length of Bso it is possible for two arcs to havethe same measure but different lengthsarc length is the fraction of a circlecircumference so if we looked at acircle over here where I've drawn aright angle and I said what is thedistance between X Y if we know thewhole circle has a circumference of Cwhere C is some circumference we knowthat the fraction here it's pretty clearis just going to be 1/4 of that because90 degrees is 1/4 of the circle so if acircle is 360 90 is 1/4 so the way thatwe calculate arc length is if I havesome circle with an arc a be the lengthof that is the circumference of thewhole circle times the fraction of thecircle so this part right here tells youif you know measure of Arc a B justwrite it over 360 and they'll tell youhow much of the circle are using so forC you could either substitute 2 pi Rbecause that's circumference in terms ofradius is equal to the measure of Arc abe out of 360 or if you wanted to youcould also use pi times diameter timesmeasure of Arc a be out of 360 so thekey thing here is that arc length is afraction of the circle circumference sowe're talking about a distance which iswhy you can have the same arc measurebut different arc lengths
