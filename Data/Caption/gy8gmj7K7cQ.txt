now it's time to talk about the antiderivatives and integrals and let'sstart by looking at a simple exampledy/dx equals 8x cubed so this is thederivative of Y with respect to X andwe're told to find Y well that's prettyeasy Y in this case is going to be 2x tothe fourth because you can see if wetake the derivative of that we get thatso Y is 2x to the fourth plus C so wehave found Y the antiderivative of thisand another name for antiderivative isin definite integral and it's indefinitebecause of that C we don't know whatnumber C is C is just a constant and itcould be any number you could put anynumber you want for C right there andthis function Y will still have as itsderivative 8x cubed so because C couldbe anything that makes this functionindefinite that's an indefinite integraland we will soon see that an indefiniteintegral gives us a way to exactlycalculate definite integrals and adefinite integral remember is somethinglike this you have a function of ax andyou want to find the area under thecurve between two points a and B that'sa definite integral and finding thisfunction that is the antiderivative of agiven function that gives us a methodthat we will learn for finding thatexact area now with that in mind notethat these two sentences mean the samething the process of finding anantiderivative is calledanti-differentiation finding anantiderivative is calledantidifferentiation that should makegood sense we can also say the processof finding an indefinite integral iscalled integration that sentence meansthe exact same thing as the firstsentence so in other wordsantiderivative is a synonym forindefinite integral andanti-differentiationis a synonym for integration and youhear both of these terms antidifferentiation and integration andintegration integration is by far themore common of those two and as we moveon through the course you'll hear mesaying integration more thananti-differentiation but that's whatintegration means it means finding thefunction that is the antiderivative of agiven function
