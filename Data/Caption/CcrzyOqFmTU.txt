hello my name is Maria and this is MattLee my mascot in this lesson we arestudying meters and kilometers inparticular but also the other metricunits for measuring length now over hereI drew one meter this blue line and onemeter is exactly 100 centimeters longyou know about centimeters rightcentimeters are found on your rulers youknow I want to show you all so here ismy ruler that has the centimeters herethese are centimeters 20 25 and so onso over here approximately 60 and thenwe go from 60 all the way over there andso 40 more 100 in total makes one meetthe units of length that we have in themetric system are these here used mostoften kilometer is used for longdistances like for example if you gobicycling somewhere or distances betweentowns and this kilo here actually meansa thousand so one kilometer is athousand meters okay so that's a longunit of length and then meters I showedyou one meter it would be for mediumsized distances or things for example tomeasure the width of a row or maybe howlong houses you would use meterscentimeters you know about those are thelittle units for small things and thenmillimeters do you remember those let meshow youit's another ruler and it is centimetersII on the top you see the numbers 20 2122 and so on right and each centimeteris divided into ten little pieces tenparts and those little parts are themillimeters okay so they are really tinynow let's go on and we're going to fillin these blanks with suitable units sowe would use millimeter centimeter meteror kilometer over here in this blanksthe eraser is 24 something long okaywhat unit would you use you think itcould be 24 centimeters long somethinglike thatnot quite I think we need to use thesmallest one the millimeters okay it'sabbreviated with mm math is one 400something what do you think kilometresmeters centimeters now he's telling meyeah sure it's metersyou still like swimming mathy oh yeah hedoes okaythe room is three something high this iseasy I just told you about the room andit really can't be three centimetersright has to be three meters the fridgeis 140 something tallcould it be 140 meters surely not 140centimetersyep that's the right one how aboutmillimeters okay 140 millimeters wouldbe actually 14 centimeters it would justbe something like that so no that catfrom Andy's home to school is free okaynow we need to use the unit for longdistances right kilometers km and thatthe mountain is 2400 tall would it bemeters or kilometers now we don't havemountains that would be 2,400 kilometerstall okay on this earth it is metersokay let's go one meter is 100centimeters like I told you how aboutfive meters how many centimeters wouldit be that should be pretty easy it is500 yeah how about 20 meters if that'sdifficult to think about 10 meters first10 meters would be double that Oha thousand centimeters and then 20meters would be double that or twothousand centimeters and then two meters17 centimeters in two centimeters tometers would be 200 and so we get 270and seven meters eight centimeters okaythe seven meters would be 700 right so700 plus eight seven hundred eightcentimeters now hear a word problem Abedis one metereighty centimeters long and 1 meter 60centimeters widefind its perimeter I've told you beforewhat should you do when there's aproblem about perimeter usually youshould sketch a picture okayso let's draw this bed it is just alittle bit longer than what it is wideokay it's not quite a square but closeso here's one meter 80 centimeters 1meter 60 centimeters this will help youthink what was perimeter you rememberthat now the around measure you goaround so for that you need to add theside lengths so 1 meter 80 centimetersplus 1 meter 60 centimeters and thenalso Plus this and this but I'm going toadd these two first and then double thatokay one meter on one meter makes twometers but what about 80 and 60 we get140 so that's one more meterone and forty centimeters would make onemeter 40 centimeters right so I get atotal of 3 meters 40 centimeters forthose two sides and then the perimeterwould be double that 6 meters 80centimeters okay here we have a box thatis 55 centimeters tall how many of themcan you stack on top of each otherin a room that is 2 meters 30centimeters tall oh hiokay my box let me use math if Matthewwas a box here then I stacked anotherbox and another box and another booklike that okay how many boxes kid you'restuck in this rule let's draw it till itis one of the boxes right and it is 55centimeters this weighs here if you hadtwo boxes two boxes okay let's put heretwo boxes 55 and 55 is 110that's one meter and 10 centimeters andso let me double that four boxes 220that's two meters 20 centimeters rightthat's real close to this so four boxesstill fit but the fifth one wouldn't sothis designs four boxes okay well donewith this list
