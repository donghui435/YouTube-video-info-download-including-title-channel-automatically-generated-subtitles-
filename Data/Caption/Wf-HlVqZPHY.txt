hey there everyone and welcome back tomashup math my name is Anthony and thankyou for joining me on this mini lessonjust go ahead and check it out[Music]hello againthank you for joining me on this lessonwhere we are going to explore scientificnotation so let's start with thequestion what is scientific notation solet's start with a definition and thenwork from therescientific notation is a way ofexpressing numbers that are either toobig or too small to be convenientlywritten in decimal formlet's take a look at a really big numberthe population of the state of Arizonais seven million two hundred thousandpeopleand now we can ask how can I usescientific notation to express thisvaluenow if you remember from our definitionwe're talking about numbers that can'tbe expressed conveniently in decimalform and thinking about this number as adecimal we can just add a point zero tothe end as a placeholder for now we dothis because scientific notationrequires that we figure out the numberof place values in between the decimaland the first non-zero digit in thiscase seven so now we can go ahead andcount how many place values there are inbetweenand we can see in this example there aresix place values so that number six thata total number of place values is animportant number and we're going to keepthat close by to use in a few momentsnow we can imagine moving that originaldecimal point to the left until it is infront of that first non-zero digit againin this case the sevennow when we're using scientific notationwe can now get rid of all of the zerosthat come after the last non-zero digitso in this case all the zeros that comeafter the value of two so now we have amuch cleaner much smaller and much moremanageable 7.2 but what about all ofthose zeros scientific notation allowsus to replace those zeros withmultiplying by the value of 10 raised toa power in this example the power is 6which represented the total number ofplace values we move the originaldecimal pointand we should note that whenever we areusing scientific notation we aremultiplying by the value of 10 raised toa power there will never be a differentvalue other than 10 in that spot so nowlet's take on another example of an evenbigger number in this case 29 billion700 million so this is nearly 30 billionthis is a very very large number and wewant to use scientific notation torewrite this value in a more convenientwayso again we can add point zero to theend of the value as a placeholder sothat we can visualize where that decimalpoint would be and now we have to figureout how many place values are in betweenthe decimal and the first non-zero digitin this case the two so in this examplewe can see that there are 10 placevalues in between the decimal and thefirst non-zero digitand now we can remove all of the zerosthat come after the last non-zero digitin this case the seven so now we havetwo point nine seven times 10 raised toa power of 10 which again was the numberof place values that we had to move theoriginal decimal so really all that wedid here was use scientific notation torewrite 29 billion 700 million in asmaller and more convenient way so takesome time to think about the proceduresand the concepts involved withscientific notation as you continue yourexploration of using it to rewrite verylarge and very small numbers in aneasier way and I'll see you all nexttime all right so that's it for thislesson thank you again for stopping by Ihope you found it helpful and if you didplease click that link below andsubscribe to our youtube channel leave athumbs up and a comment on this videoyou could really use your support andalso don't forget to sign up for ourweekly newsletter when you join ourmailing list you get a free ebookdownload as well as weekly resourcestips insights and some cool contests andgiveaways as well so don't miss out onthat there's a link on this page you canclick to join the mailing list andthat's all you have to do so thank youso much again for stopping by and forall your support and I will see you allnext time bye
