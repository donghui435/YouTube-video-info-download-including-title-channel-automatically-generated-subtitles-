amazing you'll never be able to look atcircles the same way after I show youthe way to work out the radius of thiscircle I've got something special foryou today I have a sequence of numbersthat I want you to be able to work outwhat the next number in the sequence isthese are fractions so it's going to beone on 15 one on 23 one on 39 one on 63and then something there are lots ofways I could show you how to solve thisbut today I'm going to show you a veryspecial way how to solve it okay sowe're just going to put this over here Ineed to get some equipment okay I got tostart drawing some circles my goodnessme have you ever have you ever done avideo where it's like the paper itselfhas to be precise now I can use my otherprecision instrument here my secondcircle circle number to look at thatokay so these ones are exactly the sameand they're half the diameter of the bigcircle this is going to be fun once weactually get there that was hard to getthese ones to kiss so they're nowkissing these are kissing circles somathematically we'd say that they'retouching tangentially though they'rekissing now oh okay Brady you know hardit is to get four circles to kiss do youknow how hard that is you know I have toI have to confess you I've done this afew times this is the best time I'vedone it this blue circle here just sohappens that the radius of this bluecircle here is one fifteenth of this bigcircle it's 1:15 hang onokay let me keep going so this is calleda papist chain what I'm doing here sohaving one circle touching the inside ofanother circle kissing and then havingcircles fitting in and touching all oneanother it's a big touch fest today sothese things have been around for a longtime okay so this one here touchingtouching touching so this one here thisis this new blue circle this one happensto be one twenty third of the originalradius one twenty third 115-120 thirdthis one's good look at that beautifulit is very zen the next one here thislittle guy happens to be one thirtyninth of the original large circlesthere you go I don't know how much moreof this compass I can use okay so thisguy here his radius is 160 third theoriginal radius of the big circle 163rdand so what's the next one going to bewell let's draw it in shall wethis here this here now belongs to thesecircles and so the question is what isthe radius of this circle in referenceto our first circle now there's plentyof ways we could actually work that outwe could get busy with our rulers andstart drawing triangles and maybe startgetting angles and maybe start usingdifferent kind of theorems and whatnotto try and get there but there is oneway to solve this problem which isabsolutely amazing absolutely amazinggreatit is the way to solve this problem whatI'm going to show you is actuallyamazingly hard core is a huge amount ofinformation dealing with this so whatyou have to do is I'm going to try andshow you just what we need for thisproblem and hopefully you can go andhave a look at all the other stuff inyour own time but this is something thatwe just go to Brady F trust me I'm goingto show you exactly what we need forthis problem and no more but if yourimagination is fired up that's becauseyou're thinking that's good the way tosolve this problem is using a methodcalled circle inversion there's a quickintroduction I think most people haveseen a reflection of themselves correctso if you think about that you've gotyour eyeball here so here's your eyeballso now you know how reflections workright so what you see is the mirroropposite but what actually is going onis it's this distance here 22 we'regoing to do this quite rough Brady ifthat's all right okay we know howmirrors work don't we so over this it'sthe eyeball it's your eyeball lookingback at you right this is called areflection so we're going to do aspecial type of reflection to solve thisproblem it's called a circle inversionokay now this is how it works first offyou got to start with a circle so thiscircle here we're going to be it's ourcircle of inversion so first of all whatwe need to do is we need to what we needto know the radius that's reallyimportant Brady okayso in this case here the radius is 60say we put a point out here okay so saywe put a point here okay and that pointthere is going to be a and this pointhere is o 4 origin so now we did areflection what happens in inversion isfirst of all we're going to measure oh aso we know how a equals 30 so this pointhere we're actually going to invert itand this is how you do ityou take this length here right which weknow is 30 and you multiply by the pointwe're going to we don't know where it isjust yet and it equals the circle radiussquared so this equals 60 squared so inthis case this is 30 times where we wantto go equals 60 squared so if we justdivide through and do a quick little bitof calculation then that goes twice sothat means equals 120 and so what thatwhat we've done there is we've actuallytaken this point all the way out onexactly the same line to here so thislength here is Oh a dash and it equals120 and this length here is okayand that equals 30 so 30 times 120equals the radius squared so this pointhas been inverted to this point sowhether you're inside the circle you goto the outside and if you're outside yougo to the inside and it's all based onthis these formulas so that's it thatcircle inversion you want to see whatcircle inversion can do in please rightso I've just drawn a circle within mycircle of inversion so we've onlyinverted one point what happens to allthe points the infinite number of pointsin a circle when you do the same processokay so we're going to take that circleand invert it we're going to invert thecircle that's right so what do you thinkis going to happen to all these pointstell me well my instinct yeah is thatyou draw another circle out out heresomewhere out in the in the great beyondis going to be circular that would be myinstinct not an oval my instinct is willbe another circle G you've got goodinstinctsso this point here has been inverted tothat point there so you can see thecloser it is to the circle of inversionthe closer it is on the other side socave divide that O'Brady so we haven'tplanned this very well this is hugeso cos this one is here this inverts outall the way to here so this has alreadygot some very unusual properties rightWow look at this we've actually goneover the original and we're all over theplace with this one this is huge so it'sdifferent to a reflection where thiswhere it's not scaled but this in asense is scaled this inverts to this andwhat you'll find is that you'll getthese points on the edge you see thatwhere they're both touching there'll beone point where they touch both here andhere at one point where they touch overhere and here okay if we measure thislength and times it by that lengthwe'll get 60 squared okay so whathappens is a circle will invert toanother circle okay and we don't have todo this because we showed before thepoints go back so if we started withthis circle on the outside it had comeback to this one now the other thingthat you need to know is that this istrue as well if the circle happens tooverlap the circle of inversion so youcould think what happens if the circlethat we're inverting what happens tothis circle Brady well we still get acircle well we will we definitely stillget a circle this point if this is alittle important of invert to a pointthere is only a fraction in what yeahexactly that's going to start there andcome out big yep but what's the twopoints we've already seen on the circlecan you see two points that we alreadyknow are going to be on this invertedcircle the ones that touch the line theones that intersect the line exactly soyou can you see there Brady we've done ainversion circle and it's crossed hereit's crossed here kind ofa little bit there but you can see thatit still makes another circle now is onemore I'm going to show you is one more Igot to show you I can I just say it'simportant that you prove these things toyourself but I'm not going to prove themtoday I'll show you this because thisone this one's weird and what about acircle that actually passes through theorigin well think about it well ifthere's a point on the origin rightwhat's the length from the origin ifyou're at the origin zero so in reallyit's going to blow up so points that getvery very close to the origin are goingto get huge towards infinity so we'rereally talking about a massive circlehere and you know how massive it justlooks like a line so any circle thatpasses through the origin of the circleinversion will invert to a line and loand behold check it out look at that socircle inversion amazing look at theproperties circles invert two circlesokaybig goes to small small goes to big if acircle crosses the circle of inversionit still looks like a circle and then Ithink most stunning of all a circle thatpasses through the origin will invert toa straight line so this is all we needthese two facts will kind of fact 1a and1b and then fact two okay that's all weneed so now with our information aboutcircle inversion how can we actuallysolve this problem well what we need todo first we need to make a decisionabout what sort of circle we're actuallygoing to use to invert the way to solvethis is to get this bad boy again andwhat we're going to do is we're actuallygoing to do a circle of inversion thatis exactly the same as our originalcircle okay so this is our originalcircle we're going to put the origin ofour circle of inversion right at the endso this this green dotted line is ourCircle of inversion and this is whatwe're going to do all our work with okayso this is our circle of inversion andremember it's got exactly the sameradius as our original circle that'simportant nowremember what I said Brady what are thewhat are the things that we need to knowabout inversions we need to know circlesinvert two circles if they go over thesame over the circle of inversion theystill in virtuous circles unless part ofthe circle goes through the center oforigin of the circle of inversion thenit turns into straight wrong bingo nowthis is the reason why I came becausenow I am able to invert these circlesand just using a ruler right I'm able toMabel to show you how beautiful howsimple it is now to interpret thisproblem this big circle here Brady thisbig circle here what does it invert -well first of all it passes through thecenter of inversion so we know it coz isgoing to turn into a straight line nowwhere is that straight line going to bewell you know what I don't have tocalculate anything because I alreadyknow that it intersects the circle ofinversion there so this is the radius sothis point goes back to itself so weknow that this point is on the straightline because it intersects the circle ofinversion I know what the other one is -where exactly so straight away you onlyneed two points to the final line yeahso that we we know we can actually justreally simply draw this in we'vejust put a our first inverted circlenext what about this circle here so thiscircle here also passes through thecenter of origin but it kisses theinside it kisses the inside of theinversion circle now that means it'sgoing to invert to a straight lineexactly but where is it going to be isit going to be a straight line like thator like that well let's have a look thiscircle here okay and this circle hereare both going to invert two straightlines but they only touch at the pointof origin and that point of origin ineffect is infinity so if two lines onlytouch at infinity well this is kind oftricky stuff here that's parallel that'sthe only that's the only explanationreally isn't it so you see the logicthat you can draw out of just thesesimple rules of circles go to circlesthe logic here is that well if it goesanything else it will eventually hitwhich means that point must be anintersecting point back here but we knowthat doesn't happen because there'sorigin point so you can deductivelyreason what happens here okay Brady sothis big circle is this one and thiscircle is this one now what happens tothis circle here well again we don'thave to measure anything this circlehere touches the big circle and touchesthis circle and we already know thatthis circle is that line and this circleis that line so this has to be touchingboth this and this and so really there'sonly one thing it can be if a circleinverts to a circle it has to be acircle that fits between these parallellines well let's draw that in Bradythis has happened to there this pointhasn't moved because it's on the circleof inversion but a circle has invertedto a circle now what about this guy herehow do we invert this one well straightaway we know that two points have to behere and here because they invert wellthey're on the circle of inversionwhere's another point well this one hereis on this circle here and even thoughit actually in in this diagram itactually is on it an inverted circle wehave to remember that that's not whereit's going it's actually going to hereokay this guy here these two touch rightthere so this is touching this circlethis circle of this circle I think youshould be able to see what's going onnow if this circle is touching thiscircle this circle and this circle thenin the inversion these two circlesaligns this circle is here this has totouch that that and thatwhich means it has to be another acircle exactly the same radius exactlythe same diameter see how much symmetrythere is how beautiful this is howawesome this is Brady I mean this thesymmetry of this is just breathtaking inthe inverted world we still get kissingokay now Brady there's another circlethis blue one here this is the guy herewhich is one fifteenth of the originalradius is what I told you now weactually have to invert this guy so thiscircle is that circle this circle isthat circle this circle is actually overhere so that circles there so this guyin here is kissing one two three and ofthese purples it's one two three so weknow that this blue guy has to actuallybe in here has to touch all three so isit a rule that if you kiss in real lifeyou have to kissexactly now this little circle is theinversion of the blue circle what aboutthe one that we really want this onedown here how do we get therewell we've inverted one two we're goingto invert this guy now so this guyinverts and you know what it's becomingso simple to do because we know thatit's a circle that has to touch this guyhere so this is touching this and thisis this so this circle has to touch hereis touching the big circle which we knowis that line you know it's such in thiscircle it's that line so it's just astraightforward processwhere we now have to just draw circlesin one on top of anotherthis Pappas chain of circles gettingprogressively smaller and smaller andsmaller under inversion ends up beingcircles stacked on top of each otherexactly the same radius exactly the samediameter because they're fitting betweentwo parallel lines so this is absolutelybeautiful this is this one this is thisone this is this one this is this onethis is this one so now if we thinkabout it in the Pappas chain the blueguys are touching these circles andtouching this circle here so in theinversion okay we've already seen thatthis blue circle inverts here so thepattern is going to stay the samethere's going to be a circle there it'sgoing to be a circle there they're goingto circle the other than T so for theircircle bit and all going to be exactlythe same size okay so if we can work outthe diameter of this we can work out thediameter of this and then we've got theradius so how can we do that this isepic this is seriously epic all righthere we go so we've got now this is aright angle and we know that this circlehere even though that's so tiny thecenter of this circle will pass throughthe center of this circle up herewe now have a massive right angletriangle if we know this length here wecan invert that length and it will giveus the length through this circle andbecause it's passing through the originof this little circle it will tell usthe diameter and if we divide that bytwo it will tell us the radius so shallwe do it let's bring this home I tellyou what this is absolutely epicit's very pretty though this whole thiswhole length here is our it's the circleof inversion so this half here is goingto be our on to right and this lengthherewell this circle here is a half of thatso right from here to here that's ourown four and this this little blueinverted circle here is a quarter ofthat there so that's actually our on 16so just here so what we're going to dois we know that this whole length hereall the way across our take our on 16which is equal to 15 are on 16 so that'swhat that length is equal to now whatabout this long guy here well again herethis distance from here to here is goingto be at our own 4 and all of these areon 2 are on 2 plus r2 plus r1 2 plus ourown - so that's going to be R plus R sothat's 2 R plus R on 4 so what we've gothere then so this whole length herethat's huge 9r on for now what we wantto do is that we've got Pythagoras'stheorem and we worked out this lengthand this length we can work out thehypotenuse from this o which is thecenter of the circle inversion all theway to this center here of this bluecircle when you work that out that comesto 39 onsixteen are now we actually want to knowthe distance Oh to be dashed because weknow that will invert right back to thissmall circle and we also want to know Oh- OH - but let's do this one first so weknow that o to B dash is equal to 39 on16 are plus the radius of the smallcircle which is are on 16 so that equalsthis Oh a so OAS over here we're goingback from this by our on 16 we're goingback by the radius so it looks like this39 on 16 our take are on 16 samedenominators so 39 so we end up getting38 on 16 are now we want to invert theseso we want to take o to be - back to beokay so let's do thatso o to be when we invert this we end upgetting 16 on 40 ah okayand we do the same thing with OH - a -we bring it back to the tiny littlecircle there and that means either the ais this inverted okay and then we end upgetting 8 on 19 are now we've got out ofthe a out of the B we know they passesthrough the center so we know if we gooh a take o be we will get the diameterof this small circle and that happens tomake it 2 so that's that take that whichends up being 2 on 95rbecause the radius is half the diameterso the radius here of this small circleso radius of small circle equals one on95r so we know that the original circleif we divide by 95 will give us thatradius which means this is 1 1 95
