hello in this example we are going toround some numbersnow the process for rounding numbers isfairly simple and involves two thingsthe first thing is you want to identifywhat place value you want to round thenumber the second thing you need to dois to just check the number off to theright of where you want to round thenumber now if the second number is say 5or higher you are going to change yournumber to the next highest one now ifyour number is 4 or lower you're justgoing to leave the number as it is let'ssee how this process works out withthese two examples so in this firstnumber I want to round it to the 10,000spot well as I look at my number thedigit in the 10,000 spot is this 5 hereso if that's where I want to round itI'm going to look to the number just offto the right the 3 now notice how this 3falls into that category of 4 or lowerthat means that what I want to do toround this number is actually just leavethe 5 as it is with all the rest of thenumbers I'm going to replace them with a0 this is known as rounding down becauseif I look at this new number I formed50,000 it is less than my originalnumber not too bad huh let's do this onemore timehere I have the number 4 million 60042069 I want to round this one to themillions spot and be this 4 guy again Ilook to the guide just to the right the6 to determine what I need to do withthis 4 well this 6 falls into thecategory of 5 or higher which meansrather than keep the 4 I'm going to bumpthat up one number so from 4 changes toa 5 now in much the same way all theseother numbers get replacedis zero this is known as rounding upbecause the new number I've just formedfive million is larger than my originalone and there you go all you really haveto do is identify your place value checkthe number to the right and then roundappropriately if you'd like to see somemore videos please visitmysecretmathtutor.com
