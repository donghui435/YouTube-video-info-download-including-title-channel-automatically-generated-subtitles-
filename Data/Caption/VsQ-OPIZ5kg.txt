As you can see I'm quite serious about juggling, I've have been serious about juggling for decades.I used to busk and do all sorts of things.Now what I want to show you today is how you can rip outthe mathematical soul of juggling and use it to your own evil ends. It's gonna be interesting.Now, the mathematical soul of the juggling pattern actually comes in the form of numbers so how do we get those numbers?Okay, now when you juggle usually juggle to a beat, so the music might be our own you know and on every beatballs are being caught and thrownby the hands and the hands are taking turns at least with basic juggling which we are going to stick to okay.I've tried to capture this graphically. Here's a timeline and here we've got the beat.And you see the hands like the left hand is one one sort of circular right hand is the other sort of circleNow let me justjuggle the basic pattern and count out the beats. So here we go:1 2 3, 1 2 3, 1 2 3, 1 2 3So the yellow ball always goes up on the 1 right and I count to 3.So what does it mean? For how many beats does the yellow ball stay in the air?Three beats exactly and [actually] every single ball that I throw here stays three beats in the air ok andSo we can actually put this in right?There's the red ball 3 3 3 3 3 and then the yellow ball andthe green ball and reallywhen you think about it when I juggle this pattern in the background you can hear that 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.okay and that's the mathematical soul of this very very basic pattern. Now if I were to do this with four ballsokay, four ballslet's just have a look at the red ball and [count] out the beats. There's 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4Okay thenyou knowEvery ball stays four beats in the air the mathematical soul of this pattern is justFour yeah, you know you don't do the repeatsOkay, that's for then the basic five ball Pattern five the basic six boiler and sixWe can [also] do too so how do we do - well - is you know like this?very ImpressiveWell, usually don't even bother kind of tossing them up you can hold them like this even more impressive right then one just going backAnd Forth like this you can also do zerosSo that's zero throws so in a zero through there's nothing to both be in your hand isMore important for later on you could also try [it]. Maybe minus throws it's kind of throwing things back in timeI'm still working on this, right, and I don't know how you do fractions, but anyway, maybe somebody suggest somethingOkayNow these are [the] basic patterns the basic pattern does correspond to the you know?There's zero pattern, there's a one pattern, two pattern  - but it gets much more complicatedSo if you look at a really complicated pattern you can actually find numbers different numbers at the core so say some guysJuggling something really complicated focus on what happens on one beat, okay, okay?So what he throws there is a four say again, okay, four then next beat. He throws another fournext beat throws the one and then a three andThen things start repeating four four one three four four one three four four one three you know, that's a patternAnd I just draw it for you right so now so the first speed was a four so we can draw inball here, then four then one then three and then things repeat four four one three andYou know it's kind of see at this stage that whole thing will kind of extend forever and there won't be any problemsSo I mean what problems can you expect anyway?wellwhat happens here on every Beat is there's a ball kind of coming in being caught and being tossed immediately right, soWhat do you think Giuseppe, what can go wrong here?So I mean so if you're not carefulSo if you try to juggle like two one so cut with two goals here then on an xP, two oneThe one goes there radical idea right and I mean there's juggling that takes care of those but in basicYou know in the basic set up. It's not possible okay, so we don't want this to happen. So that's one problem the second problemSometimes you would have like a zero in your patternBut something lands, and then to actually hold something in your hand, but you're supposed to do a zeroWhich is like this, so that's also out. Okay? You know as I said I meanThere's you know extensions to all the stuff that we're doing but we do the basic thing, soNothing should land on on a zero. How many balls do you think are in here?So how many balls does the juggler actually juggle so at the moment or so except for we give you a hint? Okay?so now yourRecovers yeah, there's three trajectories right and so basically every trajectory stands for one ballSo [that's] the red ball the green ball and the purple ball okay, and they'dYou [know] they exhaust the pattern so it's just three three balls in been in play here, so the one three moreIt's the same ballYeah
And that's actually a good thingTo kind of color it in like this because you can [actually] see how you're supposed to juggle the Pattern so if we just lookAt the purple ball for example. Well, what is that going to do well?It's staying in one handAnd it's just plus doing [four] so basically just ridiculous this hereover and overAnd then there's also the green ball it does the same thing on the other side right and then in the middleWe've got the red ball, and that does one three one [three] okay, so let's put it all together, okay?And when I put it together, it looks like thisFour four one three four four one three four four one three four four one three four four one three and I'm so goodOkay nowYeah, that's just one of the patterns that you can get there's like lots and lotsso just show you a few of them right, so these are all possible mathematical souls of juggling patterns they're infinitely many andJust from the left column here. That's just juggling with two balls again. So juggling with two balls andWell there, we've got the two. Which was this really fancy. You know or just forget about it patternThen there was three one. Which is just this[three-one] [three-one] [three-one] you can also do three one you go the other way and when you change directionsAnd just continuously change directions. You actually get this three one two. Okay? Let's do one two three three. Three is kind of interesting aswhat you do this you just kind of juggle three three three three three and three and then you get rid of one and thenYou know you just do the zero there I plus three three zero three three zeroGood one, and then what about that one four zero four zero. What would that look like?That's right. Yeah, so four goes on up hereThen a zero then a [four] and [a] zero [so] it's just like this oneWhich was zero four zero four zero four is it?Kind of interesting and I've just highlighted a couple of other patterns here actually there's one more thing [I] can tell you aboutAll this stuff which is interesting which kind of need if you want to figure out if you just somebody gives youlike a sequence of numbers like this and says this is a mathematical soulYou don't actually have to draw the picture to figure outwhat the number of balls is that you need the only thing I have to do is you have to do the average of theNumbers and able to tell you so for example [4] [4] [1] 3 if you add [up] the numbersWe get 4 plus 4 is 8 [plus] 1 is 9 plus 3 is 12?Divided by 4 numbers is 3 right, or this guy here 4 4 plus 4 is 8?Plus 1 is 9 divided by 3 is [300] works really really neat all right nowI'm going to show you how you can generate all the mathematical souls of all the juggling patterns in existenceusing mathsWell, not all of them. Let's just focus onThe ones [that] are really relevant, so in a second videoI'm actually going to teach you how to juggle three balls, so if you're really keen watch the video andWell, then once you know how to juggle three [balls] you want to also figure out wellwhat are the different juggling patterns that I can do with three balls andreasonable thought says to throw0 1 2 3 of course and then 4 & 5 let's throw those two in to okay andSo the only thing you need to know isThe simple diagram oh, that's allThe simple diagram here, okay?wellIf we just explain to you how how does it's made up and how you get the juggling patterns out of this thing okay?So what you see here is some oblong boxesand they're filled with all possible combinations ofThree ones and two zeros obviously the three ones have something to do with the fact that we want to juggle three balls hereOkay, then we've got arrows between those oblong boxes, and they're labeled now the labels go from 0 to [5]so that obviously is something to do with the sort of flows we want to use andNow how do you get a...Juggling soul out of this one here. Well it's very easy you just go toone of the oblong boxesand then you can follow the arrows andAs soon as you get back to the box that [you] started with you've got a juggling soulOkay let's do this, let's start [at] this box here. Go over hereSo in this direction this double arrow counts as a [four] then we go up thereAnd then we go back to where we started from and we get a four four one which is actually just a shoe shapePattern[but] we don't have to stop here. We could actually do this miniLoop there three, and then it's four four [one] three and you start and endAt the [same] place you can actually get go across the same place a couple of times doesn't matterAnd you got [to] juggling pattern four four one three two one that we've been talking about in the very beginningohThat's the arrow kind of going the other way, so if you're going this way, it's counts as a toolOkay, just to make [it] a bit more compactOkay, now actually this one is kind of interesting [you] start from here, and you cannot just do this miniLoop that gives you a three. That's just the basic Pattern three three three three three oddRight now everything possible is in this diagram, right?So here's another one for example. Just going around here. This actually [is] really really boring oneSo everything's in thereBut I just really the majority of these things are terribly boring right so we don't even want to want to touch right?but point is you have this diagram here andyou just give it to the computer the computer can pick out like all thecycles no problem list them and you can kind of go through and see which one you actually want to incorporate in yourJuggling routine, okay now. How do you actually get this diagram?I also want to tell you about that okay now for that one. I really really need you to be alert so I've brought some specialJuggling balls, they actually look like bottledMathematical souls themselves so here we go. So just to wake you up. I'm going to juggle these things and actually very very special[hopefully] everybody's awake nowOkay, so here's how you actually get this [thing] here goingTo be juggling three balls okay, so imagine you're juggling three balls and what I've drawn here isThe dots at which the beats occur so beat drops. Yeah now. We're in between Beats andIt means that all the juggling balls are in the air, okay?And now there's three balls in the air and the red one is actually going to land on the next speedThe yellow one is going to land on the beat after that then two beats nothing's happeningand then five beats from now [other] green [balls] supposed to have a land okay, andI record this in the string of ones and [zeroes] okay, so I saylands landsNothing nothing landsThat's [one] [one] [zero] [zero] [one] so you're in the state in the jaggery state one one zero zero one at the momentRight you can be obviously in in many many different juggling StatesAnd this is what oblong boxes in the diagram correspond to okay now. Let's fast-forward toThe next beat okay, what happens then is of course that the red ball falls into your hand, okay?So the red balls here and everything kind of shifts forward by oneSo we're kind of going like this, soWe've got the red ball in our hand and on the next speed the yellow ball is going to land and - Nothing'sThen a land and then nothing planned for for a moment, okay nowWe have to figure out what can we do with our red ball. You know what throw can we do?Can we throw [a] zero so I can't throw a zero because that's supposed to look like this, okay? What about a one?if you throwOne at the same time as the yellow that's rightso, they're dead a dead one there you see the one so if I throw [a] one that those two would comment on together theRed one and a yellow one so I can't do that so can I do it tooYeah, yep, because there's nothing scheduled for 2, and then obviously also not for three. What about four?Yeah, and then I could also go for five these [are] really all the choices so two three and five work everything else doesn't workDoesn't everything else. [we'll] get us into trouble okay. Let's say we're going for five okay. What that means is that?this zero here becomes a[1]And we're in a different juggling state that one here right and we've basically come from this juggling stateGesture instead by juggling a 5 [ok] and now we can actually put the whole diagram together. It's quite easyso what you do is you are placed yourself in a state here andThese are the three different states?To which we get by juggling a 5, a 3 & a 2 all right?And so we do the same sort of analysis for every single state and that gives us this this diagram here, okay?and that's got the complete picture as far asThree ball juggling up to height five is concerned now. You know at some point in timeYou may want to edge hide six but then you need a different diagram, and you know this gets a bit more complicatedIt's a big diagram. It's not a big deal for a computer, okay, all rightSo what's the point of all this well?just[in] terms of recording stuff. It's really good to kind of take [out] the soul, and I just sayJuggling this thing which is basically a four four one three and I'm wearing BlindfoldAnd I'm using chain saw and I throw them behind the backSo then it's pretty easy for somebody else to kind of reconstruct what I'm actually doing all right another good reason would be toGet some sequences or some souls that allow it to learn in StagesSo for example you want to practiceThe black belt five throw, so you don't want to immediately do five five five five five [is] five balls[so] what you do is you first look for one that only involves two ballsBut has a five in it like this five zero oneActually practice that one and then you maybe get to a three ball pattern with a five in it and so on [all] rightSo that's goodThere's a couple of other reasons actually I've writtenQuite a few articles about this sort of stuff which I'll link in in the blurb here, so check it outThere's also link to a book which are I've written about this or was pretty serious about this at some stage[now] what's the point of all this well?
 the point of juggling is to have fun andPart of the point of doing this is also to have fun. So once you've got this analysis going. You can actually now you just hit [it]Hit a computer with this and let it show you all sorts of amazing things so for example here. I've got a computerjuggling 35 balls in the basic PatternOkay, and it would look exactly like this if anybody could actually juggle is now here. We've got one18 in a circleOkayHere is going [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 10 and actuallyfor compactnessWe always use a for 10, b for 11, and so on so you can seeyou know the balls being higher and higher up andSo now what else have we got to use this really nice pattern it's kind of a u-shape what?And actually I mean just talk about having fun. Obviously you know once you're talking about letters. You can ask wellIt's my name juggable well sadly notAnd in fact this action quite unlikely that if you just take an ordinary word as its juggableBut some words are talking to for example. My wife's name is juggable, her name is Anna andI can[I've] tried to juggle her but I failed as you can seeIt's quite hard to juggle and just in general say how to juggle a wife you'll find out okay?And I'm making a lot of fancier than these animations here, so this is actuallyBeyond the basic juggling, so that's actually catching simultaneously five and catching simultaneously [500] throw andThis one here is kind of simultaneous throws, so the hands are no longer taking turnsThere's also simultaneous ones obviously nobody can really juggle thisbut you knowandNow gets a lot fancierIf you actually you know you can put unicycles in the blindfolds and the clubs and all these sorts of [things] and so[you] can actually check out quite a few juggling animators. I also have some links down thereDefinitely worth doing here's another one. It's called the torture chamberIt's a very nice oneOkay, and well to finish [people] always ask me. How many how many?Balls can I juggle, and you've already seen me juggle fiveWhat comes after five?Six so that's three in one hand three in the other handThat's I can do thatSeven I can do that. Well actually just to to impress everybody here. I'm going to go nine. All right ready for a nineOkay, here. We go and first really tricky business about nine is you have to sit them in your hand okay? So there's three herethere's another three you know if you have to hold them like this now that it's six balls and hold them like this andI've got another three here. Okay. Are you ready? Yeah ready to be impressed go go for it hereWe go okay very goodAnd as all some people would need some extraif I cheatWell, I actually can't juggle nine, but it's that's that's it for todayNow what we... just getting a call hereA call, probably AnnaOh god, helloHello
