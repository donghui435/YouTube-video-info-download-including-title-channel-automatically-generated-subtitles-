Generally, we classify differential equations
into two broad categories: partial differentialequations, or PDEs, and ordinary differential
equations, or ODEs.Partial differential equations, or partial
derivatives, are what you get when you havea function defined in terms of multiple variables,
but you take the derivative just with respectto one of them.For example, you have the equation z=2x^2+3y^4,
and you take the partial derivative of z withrespect to x, and the partial derivative of
z with respect to y.You get one partial derivative equation for
each variable.Partial derivatives can be first-order, second-order,
or higher-order.So we just found first-order partial derivatives
for z with respect to x and y, because wetook the derivative just once with respect
to each variable.If we wanted to find second-order derivatives,
we would take the derivative of the first-orderderivatives.Because we're dealing with partial derivatives,
we can take the partial derivative of bothof these with respect to both variables, to
give me four second-order partial derivatives.As you can see, if we kept going, taking higher-order
derivatives, we'd get two first-order partialderivatives, four second-order partial derivatives,
eight third-order partial derivatives, andso on.The other broad category of differential equations
is ordinary differential equations.The easiest way to think about ordinary differential
equations is to know that they're any equationthat contains something like dy/dx, or d^2y/dx^2.This does not include d/dx. d/dx is a verb,
or a command that means "take the derivativeof whatever follows me."dy/dx, on the other hand, is a noun that means
"the derivative of y with respect to x".It is literally a derivative function itself.Ordinary differential equations are generally
classified by their "order".A first-order ordinary differential equation
has a first order derivative in it, like dy/dx,but no higher-order derivatives.A second-order ordinary differential equation
has a second-order derivative in it, liked^2y/dx^2, but no higher-order derivatives.In other words, you know the order of the
differential equation based on the highest-orderderivative it contains.Now let's talk about some different types
of ordinary differential equations.Linear, separable, and exact differential
equations are types all ordinary differentialequations.You can have first, second, or higher-order
differential equations for these differenttypes, but let's just focus on the first-order
functions.A first-order linear differential equation
looks like this.You might have an equation that's a linear
differential equation and doesn't look exactlylike this, but can be manipulated into this
exact form.Either way, if you can get your equation into
this form where you have the derivative hereby itself, a function of x multiplied by y
here, and then a function of x over here,then it's a linear differential equation.A first-order separable differential equation
usually looks like this.Again, you could easily have one that looks
different, but the point is to see whetheror not you can separate the variables.If you can separate the variables, then you
know you have a separable differential equation.In this equation, I can multiply both sides
by dx, then multiply both sides by y.Now I have my y variables separated on the
left from my x variables which are all onthe right.That's how I know for sure that this is a
separable differential equation.And by the way, regular derivatives, the ones
we learn about in Calc 1, those are reallyjust separable differential equations.Take this simple single variable function
from Calc 1.When you take the derivative, you get dy/dx=2,
then you can multiply both sides by dx, andyou've got separated variables, with y's on
the left and x's on the right.So even this simple derivative, which is really
the same as y'=2, is a separable differentialequation.A first-order exact differential equation
looks like this.As you know by now, your equation might not
be in this same format to start with, butif you can get it into this format, then it's
an exact differential equation.What you're looking for is a function in terms
of x and y here, a function in terms of xand y here, multiplied by the derivative dy/dx,
and a 0 value over here.We haven't even talked about homogeneous or
nonhomogeneous differential equations, sothis certainly isn't an exhaustive list of
every kind of differential equation.But it's at least an overview of the most
common types of differential equations thatyou'd study as part of a calculus class, or
at the beginning of a differential equationsclass.
