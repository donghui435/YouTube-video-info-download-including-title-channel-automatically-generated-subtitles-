hello my name is Maria and this is mathin my mascotin this lesson we are going to studymeasuring to the nearest centimeter andI'm going to be using my ruler thatmeasures in centimeters let's firstmeasure these lines these red lines hereand I'm going to put my ruler herenotice how I cannot position my rulerlike this and that is because this edgeof the ruler is not the zero point forthe centimeters instead that's a lineover here this line is the zero line forthe centimeter so I need to line up thatline with the end of that red line andthen we go to this end and we see thisline is nine centimeters long now let'stry this line over here okay you can seethat this line this red line does notreach to exactly six centimeters long itis a little bit short of six centimetersso we can say that it is about sixcentimeters long it's not exactly butit's about and that's usually the caseif you have a thing on line it's usuallynot exactly so many centimeters and thisone I line up my zero point here andthen I go over here you see this redline is just a little over 13centimeters but we can again say thatit's about 13 centimeters long nextlet's check these pencils how long theyare but before we measure them let'sguess or it's also called estimating I'mgoing to estimate or guess how long thisis and method will - what do you thinkMattie how long is this this pencil heremethod thinks it's 7 centimeters I'mgoing to guess 8 ok now we're going tocheck ok it goes past 8 centimeters it'sabout 8 and a half centimeters so myestimation was a little better than mathis let's try this one what do you thinkMatthew about this long pencil21 okay I'm gonna guess you see it'sthis one's eight-and-a-half I'm going toget 17 okay now we measure we were bothwrong it is just a tad over 16centimeters about 16 centimeters longand look Mattie what I have here chesspcs oh yeah we know Mattie loves chesshe's a rope gonna queen and a king Ihope you can see them in the camera lookat them follow wallets also show themfor the overhead camera here the king isthe tallest was but how much taller isthe kingdom the Queen how much taller isthe Queen than the rook what do youthink Messiyeah I think so too I think it's justexactly one centimeter longer you knowlet's let's now major Caicos standingthere the rook is just a tad over threecentimeters tall and the Queen don'troll away a little of a four centimeterstall so yes the Queen is about onecentimeter taller that look and then theKing come on here for the exactly fivecentimeters tall so the King is aboutone centimeter taller than the Queenokay we're all done with this lesson
