[Music]mathematics is constructed from othermath which is constructed from othermath and so on but what happens at thebottom what grounds all of mathematicsor is it just Turtles all the way down[Music]mathematics is cumulative it builds onitself that's part of why you take mathcourses in a fairly prescribed order tolearn about matrices big blocks ofnumbers and the procedure formultiplying matrices you need to knowabout numbers matrices are defined interms of in other words constructed frommore fundamental objects numbers forthis reason it's not uncommon for peopleto view mathematics as a giant pyramidwith objects and concepts constructedfrom things below themlet's pick as a concrete example fordifferent types of numbers real numbersrational numbers integers and naturalnumbers remember that the naturalnumbers are all the counting numbersusually taken to include zero so 0 1 2 34 and so onbuilding up the pyramid from the naturalnumbers we can define the integers asbeing the result of subtracting naturalnumbers they're all the possible thingsyou can get by subtracting one naturalnumber from another so 3 is an integerbecause it's 3 minus 0 and negative 3 isan integer because it's 0 minus 3 moreprecisely we can define each integer asan equivalence class or a particularcollection of pairs of natural numbersfor example the integer 3 is thecollection 3 0 4 1 100 and 300 and so onand the integer negative 3 is thecollection 0 3 1 4 100 103 and so onunder this definition the integers alsoinherit their structure and propertiesfrom the natural numbers for example theinteger associated with X Y is less thanor equal to the integer associated withZW if X plus W is less than or equal toZ plus y the order on the integers isdefined using theon the natural numbers and the integerassociated with XY plus the integerassociated with Z W is equal to theinteger associated with X plus Z comma yplus W integer addition is defined usingnatural number addition you should checkthat the structure aligns with yourintuition about the integers we'veconstructed the integers using thenatural numbers and then from theintegers we can build the rationalnumbers they're all the possible thingsyou can get by dividing one integer byanother like 1/2 7 over 512 or negative3 divided by 1 and similar to theprevious construction of the integers wecan define the properties of therational numbers in terms of theproperties of the integers one stepfurther we can also construct the realnumbers from the rationals but it's abit more tricky using something called aDedekind cut a Dedekind cut splits therational numbers into two sets one setis made up of all the rational numbersbelow the cut and the other set is madeup of all the rational numbers above orat the cut let's make the cut here allthe rational numbers less than 3 are inone set and all the rational numbersgreater than or equal to 3 are inanother set this cut or way of splittingthe rationals is identified with thesmallest rational number in the upperset which is 3 the cut defines the realnumber 3 notice that the lower setdoesn't have a biggest element there isno rational number immediately below 3for any rational number below 3 forexample 2.9 there will always be anotherrational number between that and 3 like2.95 let's define a new cut the lowerset is all the rational numbers X suchthat x squared is less than 2 and theupper set is all the rational numbers Ysuch that Y squared is greater than orequal to 2 in this case there is nosmallest element in the upper set itwould be the square root of 2 but that'snot rational this debtor can cut definesthe number square root of 2 thisparticular way to split the rationalnumbers canbe thought of as the definition of thereal number square root of two the realnumbers are defined as all the possibleways to cut or split the rationalnumbers the cut is identified witheither the smallest element in the upperset if one exists like three andotherwise it's the gap between the twosets like the square root of twostarting with the natural numbers wesubtracted them in all possible ways toget the integers then we divided theintegers in all possible ways to get therationals then we split the rationals inall possible ways to get the realnumbers these structure and propertiesof each type of number can be defined interms of the previous type in this wayall possible statements about the realnumbers like pi is less than e squaredcan be reduced to statements aboutnatural numbers mathematical objects andtheir properties the things we provetheorems about are defined in terms ofother mathematical objects and theirproperties math is built out of simplermath hence the pyramid idea but wheredoes this process of simplification endin other words what holds up the bottomof the pyramidin the late 1800s and early 1900s thiswas a real crisis for mathematicians andphilosophers mathematics has nofoundation Gottlob Freya and BertrandRussell were very worried aboutmathematics seeming lack of a foundationalong with richard dedekindof the affer mentioned Dedekind cutsthey founded and advocated for aphilosophical position known as Lotusism as in logic plus ism basically logisism says that the bottom of the pyramidof mathematics is logic mathematics isfounded in logic essentially mathematicsis logic in Russells words the goal ofLotus ism is to show that all puremathematics follows from purely logicalpremises and uses only conceptsdefinable in logical terms just as wereduced all statements about the realnumbers to statements about naturalnumbers the loge assists wants to reducethe natural numbers and everything elseto logic this leads to some obviousquestions like whatexactly is logic logis ism is aphilosophical position and the intendedmeaning of the word logic isfundamentally philosophical and notmathematical the definition is difficultto pinpoint and different for each Lodgeassist but mathematician Ernst snapperwrites that generally the lodge assessthought that a logical proposition is aproposition which has completegenerality and is true in virtue of itsform rather than its content for examplethe law of excluded middle for anycomposition P either P or not P logicshould feel simple natural and never adhoc that's what allows it to groundmathematics to sit at the base of thepyramid in the late 1800s Gottlieb Fragabecame the first person to earnestlyattempt to carry out the loge assistproject he spent years developing anextensive system of logical axioms andnotation a foundational system fromwhich he derived the basic laws ofarithmetic the project seemed to be alow Jesus success until Bertrand Russellrather famously ruined itjust as frege's book was going to pressRussell pointed out that frege's systemcontained a contradiction using thebasic law v one could derive Russell'sparadox the set of all sets that do notcontain themselves even though Russellwitnessed the specific errors in frege'swork he was inspired by its central goalto give mathematics a logical foundationtogether with Alfred North WhiteheadRussell continued to push the low dosesto Genda in their three-volume principiamathematica the work succeeded inreducing large sections of mathematicsto an axiomatic system and famouslyexhausted the first few hundred pagesproving that one plus one equals two butnot all the axioms they used were purelogic this is essentially the samestatus as mathematics most well-knownaxiomatic system Zermelo Fraenkel settheory from the axioms of ZF set theoryeven without the sometimes controversialaxiom of choice one can derive most ofclassical mathematics that is you canreduce most known math to those eight ornine axioma Lotus's success we now know thanks togirdle that will never have an axiomsystem which produces all of math it'simpossible to prove the ZF axioms willnever produce a contradiction but nonehave been found so far another good signunfortunately some of the ZF axiomscannot be considered a pure logicfor example the axiom of infinity whichasserts that there exists infinite setscannot reasonably be considered an axiomof pure form it asserts something aboutcontent something more than basic logicso as snapper jokes since at least twoout of the nine axioms of ZF are notlogical propositions in the sense oflogis ism it is fair to say that thisschool failed by about 20 percent in itsefforts to give mathematics a firmfoundation logis ISM had some successesand huge portions of modern mathematicallogic are the historical or mathematicalconsequences of the crisis about thefoundations of mathematics we've neverreally figured out what's at the bottomof the pyramid but along the way we'vediscovered a ton of other fascinatingmathematics and philosophy hello you allhad a lot of awesome responses to ourepisode on pseudo-random numbers and alot of your comments had to do with whatthe nature of randomness is where doesit come from and paradoxically excellentsaid I believe I've heard that thedigits of pi past most statisticalrandomness tests and they never repeatbut they are also not random that's areally interesting point maybe they'repseudo-random they do pass or we believethat they pass a lot of tests forrandomness and one of those is that webelieve pi is a normal number whichreally means it's just digits aredistributed very evenly they're veryspread out all the digits and all thesequences of digits are equally likelyand we talk about that a lot in ourepisode combining PI and E so check thatone outpan Rafael asked a great question can'thumans come up with random numbers italso really gets at the question what israndomnessand there were also some awesomeresponses so Nathan Rasmussen says thathe teaches a class in cryptography andbasically if you ask people to come upwith a random number there's onlycertain numbers they're gonna come upwith that's kind of a fun experimentmaybe any of you who are teachers wantto give it a trya related version that are a Reynoldsbrought up that I've actually tried inclass is that if you ask people to writea sequence of a hundred random coinflips so say pretend to flip a coin ahundred times and write heads tailsheads tails over and over and over againa hundred times and then you have otherpeople actually flip a coin a hundredtimes and write the sequence out theylook very different people are afraid towrite let's say five heads in a row theythink that that doesn't seem random butif you actually flip a coin a hundredtimes you it's pretty good chance thatyou'll get something like five heads ina row or five tails in a row it's notthat unlikely and so people write downvery different-lookingrandom sequences than they actuallyrandom ones that's a really funexperiment to run in the classroom andin another comment Co Phillips link to awebsite where you can click the keys Fand D randomly and it will try to guesswhich one you're gonna click next andit's pretty good you can see how randomyou can make your sequence whether itcan interpret any patterns or not itguessed my next key about 60% of thetime so I couldn't really beat it butmaybe you can we've linked to thewebsite in the description it's reallyfun check it out
