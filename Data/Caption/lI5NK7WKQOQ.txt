people understand just two concepts inthis video first angle bisectors in atriangle and second the point where theymeet first let's understand what anangle bisector is consider angle ABC saywe have a ray BD that passes through thevertex and is between its arms if thetwo angles formed are equal then Ray BDis called the angle bisector let's erasethis and look at angle bisectors in atriangle say triangle ABC this trianglehas three angles angle a angle B andangle C each angle will have an anglebisector of its own we will come acrosssomething really interestingafter we draw all the angle bisectors ofthis triangle let ray ad be the anglebisector of angle a which would make themeasure of these two angles equal letray be e be the angle bisector of angleB these two angles formed would be equalnow we come to the interesting part letray CF be the angle bisector of angle Cand that again gives us two equal angleswhat's so interesting about this all theangle bisectors of a triangle meet atone single point and yes this is truefor any kind of a triangle acute obtusescalene isosceles or whichever the anglebisectors will always meet at one pointso if you're constructing anglebisectors of a triangle and you findthat all of them do not meet at onepoint then it means just one thing youhave gone wrong somewhere with yourconstruction let's name that point I thepoint where the three angle bisectors ofa triangle meet is called the in-centerbut does the in-centeralways remain inside the triangleirrespective of the type of the trianglelet's erase this and look at an interestrecording this recording is taken frommath open-roof calm and helps a greatdeal in understanding the location ofthe in-centerthis is triangle ABC with all its anglebisectors meeting at the in center tounderstand the location of the in centerwith different kinds of triangles we canmove the point a around doesn't matterif the triangle is acute obtuse orright-angled the in center alwaysremains inside the triangle even if wemove point B around the in center willalways remain inside and the same wouldapply to Point C the in center isactually a center of a circle where doesthe circle lie let's see look at thistriangle ABC within Center I the point Iis actually the center of the circlewhich touches all the sides at just onepointso segment a B is actually a tangent atthis pointsimilarly BC and CA are tangents at thispoint and this point respectively the incircle is actually the largest circlethat can completely fit into thetriangle remember the point I is calledthe in-centerand this circle is called a in circleyou
