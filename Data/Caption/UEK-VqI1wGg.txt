and I welcome to tech math Channel whatwe're going to be having a look at inthis video as a way of directly dividingpolynomials so it's a really reallygreat way of dividing polynomials I theprevious video and most videos you'llever see what the LRC is a way of doinglong division of polynomials but this isa way of a shortcut okay this will saveyou lots and lots of work so first offI'm going to write down under the toppolynomial we'll be looking at with thisso say we had in the last video by theway we had this example here where wewere in X take away 3 and this was beingdivided into x squared plus 3x take away18 ok so the way that we directly divideour polynomials is as follows a binomialhere into our polynomial is as followsit's really really simple a littletrickier to it starts out the same waywhere we look at this number here and webasically say this number goes into thisnumber how many times ok so x squareddivided by X is X okay now look we'restarted on our way to getting our answerhere there's nothing we're going towrite down here at all the innocence isgoing to stay fairly clean so what we donow to get our second term is we don'twrite anything down here we don'tmultiply anything out what we do is weactually look at this minus 3 it isnegative 3 and we put the inverse tothat up here so the inverse of theopposite of minus 3 is positive 3 ok sonow what we're going to do is we'regoing to get this positive 3 we're goingto multiply it by our previous answerand we're going to add it to this answerhereokay and then you'll see what we do withour answers it's a fairly fairly commonsense sort of thing so positive 3 timesX is 3x plus 3x is 6x okay so I'm goingto put the six down there but whatyou're going to see is we've already gotour X here so we're actually going todivide we're actually not going to putthat X down here and we're going to justforget about it for the minute becausewe're going to exhale so the next answeris going to be without an X or X to thepower of 0 so this just becomes positive6now is there a heads up okay wait asecond you say surely they can't be itit is wait a second I think you probablyneed to go to another one of these tosee how simple this actually is so I'llwrite the next question down so say wehave this one and this will take alittle bit of getting used toso don't just look at that last one andsay oh I don't get that at all I'm nevergoing to be able to do this so we'regoing to divide X minus 5 into X for X Iera 4 take away X to the power 3 minus21x squared what about we do plus 11xand we will go plusby tape by 32 okay okay now what we'regoing to do with this is we're going toget this equation and we're going todirectly divider so first off I'm justgoing to move it across so it's a bitmore Center there we go and we're goingto divide this directly so we're notgoing to get any of this working outdown here so first off we look at ourterms here and we say X goes into X tothe power 4 how many times it goes in Xto the 3 times so our next answer isgoing to be an x squared answer the nextone is going to be an X to the power 1answer the next arrow is going to haveno excellent this will just be ourremainder part down here how do you getthat so first off we look at this to getour next part we look at the inverse ofthis minus 5 which is positive 5 sopositive 5 we multiplied it by thisnumber here and we added it to the nextterm ok so positive 5 times X cubed ispositive 5 X cubed and we're going toadd it to this number here which isminus X cubed so I'm going to end upwith 4x we're not going to put down 4xcubed we go the next power down which issquared ok so that's a positiveokay so to get the next part of ouranswer you're going to see it's going tobe not at x squared it's going to be Xokay X to the power of one so positivefive times 4x squared is 20x squaredminus 21x squared is minus X and thenminus 1x but not square this is going tobe our of our itself power of 1 okay sowe get to the next part of our answerfive times minus X is minus 5x plus 11 Xis positive 6 okay not positive 6xfigures 5 times minus X is minus 5 Xplus 11 X is positive 6 X we're notgoing to put that 6 down here whereverthat X nu is going to put the 6 downthere okay you're pretty good with thisso then we have now have a look at whatwe have left so the way we do this is asfollows we go 5 times 6 which is 30we're going to add this to this so 30plus minus 32 is minus 2 sort of aremainder of - to isn't that feelingthat easiest way of doing this ratherthan having all this working out whichyou would have seen on this other videoI made or other people's videos this isa direct way of doing this and it worksok so what about we have a look atanother example here how does that soundah so ok we'll we'll do one which is nowlet's let's do it it clears beI'll get rid of all these and we willwork this one out okay so what about wedo X plus two and we're going to dividethat into two X to the 5 plus 6 X to the4 now this one is going to be utterlyenormous is it plus 7 X to the 3 plus xsquared minus 13 X and minus 16 look atthat I run out of line there betterextend thatso let's directly divide this in now sofirst off what we do is we look how manytimes is X going to to X to the 5 andyou're going to see that it goes in to Xto the power of 4 and that's our firstterm so the next one is going to be an Xto the power of 3 and X to the power 2and X to the power 1 underneath just thenormal term so our inverse of positive 2is negative 2 so minus 2 times 2 X tothe 4 is minus 4 X to the form we'regoing to add that to 6 X to the 4 so weget 2 X to the 4 but it's suddenly 2 ik+2x before we go down the power so it'sgoing to be 2 X to the power of 3 okayso we get the next term we're going togo minus 2 times positive 2 which isminus 4 X to the power of 3 and we'regoing to add this to 7 X to the power 3so minus 4 plus 7 is positive 3X to the power not a three though we'regoing to put it down to the power downso x squared okay next we're going to gominus two x three x squared which nearlyminus six x squared plus x squared isgoing to be minus five x squared isminus six plus one is minus five okay so- five not x squared it's just going tobe X okay minus two x minus 5 is minustwo x minus five x sorry is minus ten asits positive 10x so positive 10x plus 13x is minus three because we're going togo the next power down okay so I'm notgoing to have any X there at allwhat's our remainder going to be wellit's going to be minus two x minus threewhich is six plus 16so our remainder it's 10heckles that right that is a reallyreally fast way of doing it now in thenext video I'm going to show you what todo when we deal say I put a two hereokay because there's a slight littletrick that we have to do I hope to seeyou thenokay bye
