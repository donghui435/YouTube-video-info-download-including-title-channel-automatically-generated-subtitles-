It begins with a large tortilla.Cut a strip from the
middle where it's widest.And free this long rectangle
from the useless wedgesthat surround it.This is how we start our
journey towards creatingthe perfect food.The hardest part is folding
an angle of equal thirds.But if you folded
a piece of paperinto thirds for a
letter or a pamphlet,you know the principal,
approximate, and thenadjust until you reach equality.In the case of the tortilla,
to get an equilateral triangle,you fold an angle
rather than an edge.Be sure your folds
meet at a point.One corner of a triangle.Unlike paper, this soft
and delicious tortillais forgiving, adjusting
easily rather thancreasing and crumpling.Continue folding one
triangle on top of another.Pinch each fold to
give it a crease.10 triangles are necessary.Remove the extra.Arrange the strip of
triangles into a hexagon.Note that the folds
naturally wantto go the same way
you creased them.This will help you to arrange
the overlap so that itis symmetric, woven together
in the same way you would foldthe flaps on top of a box
to support each other.In paper, I might use
9 triangles, and thena piece of tape.For tortilla, use 10 and
attach the first to the last.Score the tortilla lightly
with a knife to ruff it up.And then use your fingers
to wet it with water.The water combines with
the flour in the tortilla.And by pressing the triangles
firmly to one another,they are effectively
glued together.Thus, a tortilla
hexaflexagon is created.It can be flexed by pinching two
triangles together and pushingin the opposite side to get
a flat three armed shape.Then opening up the inside.However, it is imperfect.For it is not yet delicious.Luckily, there are several
sophisticated toolswith which to
remedy this problem.The first of which is guacamole.I start with the easily
spreadable ingredients,which can be folded flat
into the hexaflexagon.Flex it by lifting the three
parts with the flappy foldedcreases and fold
them to the inside.Then the bottom
can be opened up.And the flexagon is
once again ready to bepiled with delicious
ingredients.The precious guacamole being
stowed safely within the folds.After adding beans and
cheese, your hexaflexamexagonis ready for consumption.To eat, flex only halfway and
bite the delicious exposedtriangular pockets of
flex mex perfection.As you can see, the
ingredients tendto leak slightly out of
the folds of the flexagon.This is expected
and unavoidable,as the nature of the burrito is
to be a delicious leaking messregardless of whether it is
cylindrical or hexaflexagonal.As your next flex mex project,
consider the humble craneguarding her flavorful nest.
