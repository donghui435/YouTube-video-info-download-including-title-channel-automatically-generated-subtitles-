hello welcome to the next video show youhow to do things this one is on bondmass the order in which you do equationsso we're going to start out this one's alittle example three plus two timesseven and I want you to quickly workthat out I'll give you a few secondsokay now which answer did you get didyou get the answer of 35 or perhaps 17well I'm here to tell you right now thatif you've got the answer 35 you are infact incorrect the correct answer with17 so we're going to be looking at whythis is the case and first off we'llhave a look at the different ways thatyou might have got your answer we'lllook at the wrong way of doing itfirstly when if you've got the answer 35so the way I'm guessing you probably didthis if you got the answer of 35 is likethis first you went 3 plus 2 and you got5 and that left you with 5 times 7 andthen 5 times 7 gave you the answer of 35yeah well it's incorrect if you're doneat that one so who to break it to youthe good news is that it right now I'mgoing to show you the right way of doingit so we'll have a look now even got theanswer is 17 this is probably the wayyou would have done it and it sort ofbeen the right way of doing it first offyou are going to times 7 2 times 7 givesyou 14 this leaves you with 3 plus 14 3plus 14 gives you 17 and 17 like I saidis the right answernow the reason one of these is right andone of these is wrong it's because inmaths there's a particular way that youhave to do equations of particular orderand this as you can see and as you haveseen affects your answer okay this canbe easily remembered you're prollyremember in high school is the idea ofbaaad maths or possibly bombed ass whatthis means is this is the order in whichyou do an equation first off you doanything with brackets the next thingyou do is anything which is orders thismeans things like squared cubed or eventhe square root the next things you door any division multiplication and youjust there's left to right like you'rereading a sentencenext thing you do is any addition orsubtraction again left to right so weuse this to answer a few questions andto get the right answers so first offwe'll have a quick look at applying thiswith the question we just did three plustwo times seven is two operations herethere's addition and there'smultiplication now we use the word bymess there's nothing in brackets there'sno orders the division multiplication isone there that's the two times seven sothis is one we do first two times sevenis fourteen last of all we do theadditionso three plus fourteen gives us theanswer of 17 okay nice and easyso using bonus we'll have a look atanother question this one here five plusfour squared times three now we gothrough by mass there's nothing inbrackets but there is some orders that'sthe four squared bit now four squaredmeans 4 times 4 4 times 4 is 16 so weget the question 5 plus 16 times 3so a part of the question do we do nownow looking at bod mass what we do isthe multiplication 16 times 3 16 times 3gives us 48 so this loser leaves us withthe question 5 + 48 to which the answernow can easily be worked out is 53 we'llhave a look one more example okay thisone's going to be a little bit harder soright now I can get you to work out 3Open bracket 6 plus 2 over the squareroot of 16 now and just give you alittle hint give you a number like thisis 3 6 plus 2 part what it actuallymeans is 3 times 6 plus 2 and bracketsso we have a quick look about pod Matt'sfirst bit you will see there is theresomething in brackets so this is a partwe do first 6 plus 2 gives us 8 and thispleases the question three times a overa square root of 16 going along Nexenpod math there's something in order sowe do that part next that's the squareroot of 16 so the square root of 16 is 4this leaves us with the question 3 times8 over 4 what part do we do now well goall across we do this times part so 3times 8 24 is lose 24 over 4 and then 24over 4 gives us the answer of 6 so if wecan remember all these things with bondmass first do something with bracketsthe next part you're going to do isanything with orders the next partyou're going to do is any dividemultiply the next part you do is anyaddition subtraction you'll be fineworking these out okay good luck withthatyou
