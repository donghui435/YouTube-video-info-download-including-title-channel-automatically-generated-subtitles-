g'day and welcome to the tech mathchannel in this video we're going to behaving a look at a few little tricks onhow to do the 9 times table this is afew little tricks mainly inspiredbecause I've been teaching my own littlekids at home I headed through the 9times table and they've ended up findingit to be the easiest of all the timestimes I used to also was that when I wasa kid mainly because of these two coupleof tricks which I or one of which I wasshown when I was a kid another one whichI actually worked up on myself which isa pretty obvious one as well but maybeyou haven't seen it so anyway I'm goingto show you both of these today numberone of them is using your hands toactually work at the times table anotherone if you don't want to be sitting atcounting your hands is one where you canactually look at the number of times youby 9 and immediately pretty much workout the answer off that so I'm going togo through both of these are examples inthis video so the first one is going tobe the hands one and that's here's somehands I prepared earlier I'm not goingto show my own hands my own handsthey're a little bit not really theprettiest things that you ever want tosee but these hands I've drawn herebasically I've got my left hand and myright hand and also have the thumbsI don't either side so the palms arefacing towards me um and we number theseone two three four five six seven eightnine ten you don't have to draw thenumbers on your fingers by the way butyour mind if that helps you so anywayhow do we use this well say you're goingto do a question like three times ninewell let's count to the third fingerokay three times nine so we can't do thethird finger one two three this fingerhere would fold this finger over okayand then we look to the left and we lookto the right of this and we get ouranswer through this so on the Left wehave two fingers and on the right of ourfold-over finger we have one two threefour five six seven fingers okay there'sour answer 27 that's how this works it'snot a that's a very very easy way of ourworking things out I come I'll go to adifferent example I'll just get rid ofthat and let's do the example now I'lldo a bit of a bigger number seven timesnine seventimes 9 9 times 7 same thing okay so wefold this finger over and then we countthe number of fingers on this side whichis 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the numbers on thisside of the fold-over finger 3 theanswer is 63 and that's the way you canuse your hands to work out the 9 so I'msaying what works for all of them rightup to our even possibly if you were tosay what's 10 times 9 and you can lookat it and then what you could do is youcould say well you can fold this thumbdown I guess and then you could say onthis side I have nine fingers and I haveno fingers on this side so the answer is90 so that's the way it works and if youeven have extra fingers I actually thatwill just confuse you so we won't wewon't do that what we'll have a look atnow is a different way that you can alsodo the 9 times table this is the waythat I use generally do it as a kid andthis is where you are you use a numberand immediately can work it out so I'llget rid of the hands I've drawn and I'llshow you how I used to work this out asa kidI'll give you any actually I'll startthis out by writing out a few of thetimes table so we have 1 times 9 equals9 2 times 9 equals 18 3 times 9 equals27 4 times 9 equals 36 okay I'm notgoing to fit too many more in so I won'ttry I will smooth these there and theway this works is this a so when I was akid I used to look at this number thefirst thing is to realize so let's torealize that all the answers to the 9times table added up to 9 so 9 is 9 but1 plus 8 is also 9 2 plus 7 also equals9 3 plus 6 also equals 9 are the same asyou guys next time is 45 that equals 9in fact any W times by 9 funnily enoughyou'll find that the answers actuallyadd up to 9 or add up to a number that 9goes into and this even includes reallyreally big numbers ok um but first thingI notice was that but the second thing Inoticed was this so say we have a 3 herethe way I used to do this is as a kid asa look at this and say well 3 times 9the number under 3 is a 2okay so the first part of my answer isgoing to be a - I need to think tomyself for because all answers that yourx y9 add up to 9 what number would I addto 2 to get 9 2 plus 7 is 9 so theanswer is 27ok so this one here the number 4 4 is 33 plus 6 equals 9 our answer is 9 okI'll give you another one here I'm justgoing to find my eraser losing the allthe things on my screen at the momenthere we go I'll just get rid of thoseand I'll write AR a different one downall right say something down like whatabout 8 times 9 so we look at the 8there next number under 8 is 7 7 plus 2equals 9 the answer is 72 ok and thatworks all the way right up to I guess 10times 9 where you can think of that youknow then you could think well 10 times9 and you could say the number under 10is 9 and 9 plus nothing equals equals 90okay there's a 9 plus nothing as 9 soanswer is 90 and that's the way I'vealways found the 9 times table to bereally really easy I'm gonna link on tothis also a way of actually doing the 9times table like any the not 9 times Iwas dividing by 9 instantly this iswhere you can actually divide reallyreally big numbers quite quickly usingjust a little trick I have okayI hope you found that helpful okay seeyou later bye
