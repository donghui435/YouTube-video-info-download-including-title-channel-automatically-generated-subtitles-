it was good but like wind alright so thepurpose of today's lesson is to provetriangles congruent right and that'swe're gonna spend the next 20 minutesdoing yourself so we want to prove thesetwo triangles congruentwhat does congruent mean real quickleave all the same completely identicalright rightone of the ways of proving trianglescongruent is by this law called a SA andwe're gonna talk about it now so let'ssay right now are these trianglescongruent yet no okay so let's see who'sthe right so now they have one congruentangle are these triangles congruent yesyeah no because you can have trianglesthat one congruent angle but theirbottoms are all crazy you know andthey're very differentso these triangles are congruent yeahwhat about now they have one congruentangle and one congruent side now arethey congruent do you think yeahalmost almost on us they have onecongruent angle there it is in the redand they have one congruent side here itis in the green and let's do this nowthis is mark with like two okay now lookclosely they have one congruent anglethey have another congruent angle andthey have a side between them that'scongruent just like it's spelled now canyou guess are these two trianglescongruent now yes yes question pleaseokay I will never mindso yes these two triangles are congruentand they're congruent by the law a siwhat is a si stand for Englishangle-side-angle very good so we couldsay these two triangles if they haveanything less then they're not congruentthat's the point so let's try to let'sdraw two more so these are congruent bya that's a next - all right you gonhowever you like with side by side makethem look like slightly non equilateraland so we ask are these trianglescongruent Jack no question did you saythat they from the a si is only for cubetriangles well any triangles can becongruent with a si as long as they havethe a si relationship as in an anglecongruent beside congruent and anotherangle congruent and just like it's speltthis is something that students missjust like it's spelt the S is betweenthe two angles so check it out see howthe green one is between the two angleshere here that's a si right just likeit's spell now we're gonna do anotherone okay so these triangles aren'tcongruent yet let's do the same willcongruent to this oneI think I'm ruined no let's do this sideagain congruent to this sideare they congruent yet still no nowwe're gonna make them congruent by a a sso notice the side is not between theangles so which side should it be do youthink it should be or security whichangle should it be should it be thisangle and this or the right one pleasein the back right bottom right that'sright so let's put them inyou guys good job I'm glad you'revolunteering don't be afraid to be wrongseriously it's all good I'm wrong allthe time it's too bad I'm a teacher notgood so what I'm teaching you how to bewrong so that's part of meso it works um it's fine never thoughtof that before that's cool so check itout two angles that are congruentthere they are two angles that arecongruent and a side that's knotsbetween them this the side that isbetween them the side is not between thetwo angles sorry these trianglescongruent now yes by a mess okay anyquestions so we're moving on yes okay solet's try some more let's draw twotriangles like this kind of back to backback to backthe goal of this lesson and every lessonfollowing it will be to prove twotriangles congruent two or more as yousaid Cornelius so so are these trianglescongruent even though they're back toback you know I they can brew into eachother yet they're not all right so let'ssee if we can start marking them choosethe red that question if you prove thetwo bottom sides anglenot enough yeah well we'll walk throughit right now it appears that there'snothing congruent about these twotriangles it appears but the secret isthere is one thing that's congruentabout them so start to think about inthe back your mind so let's say if Isaid this angle was congruent to thisangle so now do they have an A or an Ssharon hey you're good nation now let'sdo here now these are explicitly 90degrees each so do they have another aor S which one is it Hey okay so itlooks like they have an A you haveanother a so we need one more don't wewe need to simply need they come inthrees so you need one more does anyonesee that there's another one in therehiding okay two people it's okay if youdon't keep looking there's another onein there hiding it's either anotherangle or side can you see it which oneit isyes this side here yeah why why is ityou right okay if I share it yeah soisn't the goal to prove this trianglecongruent to this triangle and so forproving this trinomial congruent to thistriangle we say okay well this side Iusually mark it with three so it standsup this side for the left triangle isthe sameas this side for the right triangle sothey are these two sides are sharedtheir back to back so they have the sameany questions about that this propertiesthen you know what it's called when youlook at yourself in the mirror you seeyour reflection yes so this is calledreflexive property reflexive propertylike if you were to say already callthis side a B and you would say a B itis congruent to a B and this is calledthe reflexive property that's somethingthat you need to learn reflexiveproperty and the way I remember it isyou're looking yourself in the mirror aB is looking at its up in the mirror youknow this is like Albert Baron Paulwhatever Albert is looking at himself inthe mirror is looking at himself andMary sees this on reflection and thereis reflexive property it's a good way toremember yeah sure same thing becausethat's the same way okay so now arethese two triangles congruent yes bywhich Lockleys is a si that's right andwe can tell it's a si because the sideis between the two congruent angles justlike it's spelled the side is betweenthe two angles that questions okay allright moving along let's do another oneof these back-to-back onesyou
