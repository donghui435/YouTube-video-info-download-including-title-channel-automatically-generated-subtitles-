okay so we'll talk about this in asecond actually so I think we're good atthree main categories he scales multiplechoice and then free response okay theseare the kinds of questions that you'regonna ask someone you're gonna pull yoursurvey but that doesn't answer well okayhow am I actually going to convey thesequestions to someone so there are atleast four different ways where you cansort of break these down into differentcategories then you can actually takethese questions that you have carefullydesigned and then pose them to otherpeople so I want to suggest what's aweight if you want to get data orsomeone then you can do it okay so I'mgonna put actually make this my last oneyou can have some kind of online formall of these yeah like we said you knowthe census is going online which isgreat okayyou could go for a paper questionnaireand you can hand it out to people apaper okay so you could actually talk topeople I'm gonna say that's like a faceto face now the last one is kind ofhalfway in between you might see by theway I've give at least a particularorder I've put them on a scale see whatI did there I wonder if you could workout what my scale is about what would besort of halfway between actually sittingdown with people yeah okay so as you godown this this list right it's gettingeasier and it's getting cheaper rightyeah it's more and more it's more morepractical but of course there's atrade-off right so the thing that I'mgonna put in between here is whathappens there about six or six-thirty inyour house because that's the time whenmost people are harmed and the phonerings right and it's someone fromMelbourne actually trying to like get asolicitora photo surveillance a very - is easy ona cheaper than a face-to-face interviewbut not quite as much as just saying canyou fill this therefore yep yeah okay solike a nativity though we should sayobviously depending on the way youdesigned the it's a great way anddepending on the weight you design itlike you could do a face to faceinterview someone and say hey this wouldbe completely confidential all of yourdata will be aggregated taken away fromyour name etc okay now last thing I wantto talk about is um biases so you designyour collector questions you think aboutthe way you're going to pose them topeople but you have to be really carefulabout trying to make sure your survey isas objective as possible and it's goingto get the most truthful answers rightso there are two sort of bias is kind oflike something that tells you towards r3in one way versus another regardless ofwhether it is true or not that's what wemean by a bias okay so I actually haveI'm gonna get you guys to go and lookthis up later cuz super interestingthere are two broad categories of biasesthe first one is a response bias andI'll give you a couple of examples sothis excuse me I feel feeling out ofsurvey right I'm filling out a surveythere's a bias called socialdesirability bias yeah I wonder if youcould guess just from the name what youthink is bias means you're filling out asurvey and the question asks yousomething like you know do youdo you exercise regularly right now ifyou're so lot about my age it's highlysocially desirable to say yeah suretotally exercise really regularly justso I'm good here I'm gonna give ananswer that I think is sociallydesirable but even if it's not truthfulI'm like well this is kind of what I'dlike to be and so that's that's kind ofthe way I'm going to lean more towardsthat way rather than accuracy so socialdesirability so you've got to be reallycareful when you ask questions and nowthe response bias is what's called anquiescence described here kind of it'ssort of I'm always gonna agree yeahwho's gonna agree with someone now ifyou freeze all of your questions in aparticular way we tend to want toacquiesce with the way oppression isright so I'll give you an example apersonality survey all right it couldask two questions you know do you liketo spend time alone versus do you liketo spend time with you know groups ofpeople okay now if I see both of thosequestions as I look at each individualquestion I'm kinda tipping towards wellI could agree with both of those becauseI do like to spend time alonenobody can we spend any time for peoplequite introverted so like I'm just gonnasort of tend toward saying yes towhatever way the question is phrasedright how did you get away from this howdo you try to avoid this bias thateveryone hasokay so I couldn't avoid having like thetwo questions that are going to cook itat each other that's one way of doinganother way I could do it is it all ofthe questions that are phrasing I wantto make sure an equal number of themhave a case a positive and each of anequal and I have a number of babies likeyou should answer in the negative forsome of these questions if you'rereading it properly okay so I got acouple of response biases there thereare more but this just sort of gives youa bit of a taste note and the secondcategory is just specific to surveys butit has a real effect on something youshould actually just go look up likeeven if the most detail you look at isthe Wikipedia article for a list ofcognitive biases it's super interestingI don't know how many of your interestin psychology at all but there are lotsof different kinds of just the way wethink is always biased in one directionand the way that you answer questionstherefore is flavored butter so I'llgive you some examplesOh stereotyping we all stereotype on youkind of don't have a choiceright because you don't know everythingand so you have to base your knowledgeon a broad range of things based on youknow what do you think of all my dadalways loves to start sentences likeI've got racist but and then he'll sayto me something which is completelygeneralized for like the one person of acertain ethnicity than he's ever met inhis whole lifetimeso we stereotype and if you are getasked questions about your types ofpeople or types of experiences that willclearly be favored by flavor by the veryvery smaller instances you have that'swhat stereotypes are and the last one isour really fancy day it's cold it'scalled reactive devaluation yeah that'sa really really fancy out of this Icauses a lot of coming up with fancynames for thingsI want you come back to this list webroke earlier about how to ask questionsright now we already pointed out it'sclearly more expensive to do face toface interviews over just giving peopleon my phone sending them a link it's aplease answer us right but one of thechallenges that's presented by aface-to-face is you what itsdisadvantages is that depending on whois asking you the questions yousometimes react by sort of saying ohit's only because of you or the personwho passed me okay so just think aboutif you ever had like a telemarketer askyou know different thingsand you kind of your automatic reactionis I don't really want to talk to you Idon't really want to you know agree withwhat you're saying when I talk tosalespeople I automatically have thisyou're just trying to sell me there waslike that's like I already on beforeI've even spoken to this personI'm like you're trying to sell mesomething so my reaction is to devaluethe kinds of things you're going to sayto me so this is kind of loaded like ifthey're asking you an opinion about doyou value this or that then who's askingyou that question has a huge impact itincludes you to answer one way versusanother so you have to be very carefulthat how you design questions and howyou actually convey those questions toother people okay
