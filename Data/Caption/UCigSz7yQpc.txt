that's right you remember a very firstlesson together I showed you a video doyou remember what the video is about doyou remember we sat down I showed it toyou if you don't remember it's all aboutthe fact that maths is badmatt is patterns so it starts a yeahyeah that's rightchannel 4 so it's all about all you knowlike a snowflake look at the pattern ofit and you can describe itmathematically or look at the noise thatcomes with oh and a train door closeswhere you can describe all that noisemathematically and I'm not I'm not okayand the cool things have happened isthat once you recognize a pattern whenyou recognize a pattern well yes but whyokay you can follow the pattern inplaces where can I say this like in thefuture you can predict things you canyou can understand how things work ifyou don't pattern okay now let me givean example I was reading I was readingthe newspaper the other day and this isjust something over my head so maybe didyou test a bit funny but I'm pretty sureit said something like astronomers havediscovered a planet orbiting some starsomewhere out there and the compositionof its atmosphere very similar to thecomposition of Earth's atmospherenitrogen this oxygen that it's all insilver so that was kind of cool rightbut then well he was my question here'smy question how do they know that likeall this stuff about that this fear andall that kind of thing well maybe Idon't know this is there's green andblue stuff that doesn't have to do withlike I could chuck this into space andit would still be the same greeny blueysort of color that's herewell no but no no you know not that faroff I mean we're looking at theseplanets through a telescope no one'sever been there but they recognize apatternlike it's something about the chemicalsand they give off certain radiationlight wavelengths and so on and becausethey do that they understand what theplanet is like even if you'd have beentherethey'd have to could fly there andmeasure they know the pattern so theycan say something about that planet evenhaving never me man okaynow we're gonna have a look at a similarkind of idea when we think about anglesand parallel lines okay but first let'sjust introduce two terms okay orreintroduce run up so let's get somedefinitions here firstly now here's whatI'm gonna ask you to do I actually wantyou to write a sentence for me okay andit starts off like this power legs ahand what are they how would you definethem I reckon where you get a fewdifferent definitions here probably afew that are valid if you've been taughtsome will be better than others let mejust give you about 30 seconds so have athink about write something down ontoyour board someone who's never heard ofwhat parallel lines are how would youexplain define what they are to thatperson write down write it down writedown you please make up and I'll geteveryone to UM give me their suggestionsin about any way okay all right I reckonit's bad enough time let me hear somedefinitions parallel lines are someonewant to give a suggestion oh yeah whoaopposites let's put that one downyou got something different lines thatnever be true lines it never me doesanyone have something different againthat'slenz I read it a little okay but that'skind of yeah I would hurt the parallellines are lines that run that's rightthat run I suppose that begs thequestion what does Carlo me there'severyone something is different againokay yeah okay okay let's have a thinkabout this now I think we're on tosomething here um why does it run inparallel I'm gonna give I'm gonna givethat what it takes because I thinkhopefully by definition that is trueparallel lines are always straightbecause you were thinking about linesthat don't they're they don't band orwave around that kind of thing okayoppositesI suppose this depends on what you meanby opposite I'm gonna come back to sewon a second now I think this is yourseighty right and I think Chloe youwouldn't say there's anything lines thatnever meet okay so I have a question foryou I know I can't have an infinite linelike I can't draw one but I can havepart of the line and that represents thewhole pictureimagine them stretching your forever gottwo nights now let me ask you thisquestion okay you have a look with mehere we go okay if these are two linesare these lines ever going to meetwhere's this one gonna go this one'sgoing to go back into the whiteboardright and then out through that windowokay that one next to the door okay thisone is gonna go down through thewhiteboard and then off up into ourwindow okay these are these aren't gonnameet are they foreverright but would you call these parallellines yeah well if we just stick withthis definition lines never mean you'dcall these parallel now see this iswhere we come at it okay now hold on asecondhow about how are these two words addthese parallels I assume your morningappreciate yeah righthow about if I move it here still yesbut what are thisnow I came to he's he's the importantthing this lines that never meet rightis I think it's the start I think thefirst half our definition but it seemslike we shouldn't call these thingsparallel because then they're not youknow they're not running together in anysense they're completely going off indifferent directions right I think ithas something to do this I think we'reon the right track herewhat does opposite mean anyway oppositesis actually we give this the other daywith another class another word that's abit like opposite is uh you knowopponent opponent or opposition whatdoes that mean it means the other sideit means they're armed they're againstyou or facing you right now in whatsense are these lines parallel but thesearen't yeah these guys aren't reallyfacing each other are they where's theseonesah okay now I still like this idea heresorry lines that never meet I want totake that as our start but I want to uselanguage that you got is nerd which wecan sort of make it a little specificokay so I'm going to say parallel onesoff why is that never meet but okay noI'm just gonna write this down and thenyou see if I can explain it okay but I'mon the same plane okay no I don't mean aflying plane I mean up I mean a flatsurface okay this is empathy now nowthat these lines are on here okay theselines are not parallel cuz they'll hitthey will mean eventually right butthese lines work and they on the sameplane so these are parallel now if Itake one of them off like this and faceit out toward you these lines are stillnot going to meet but they're notparallel because they're not on the sameplay and they're not on the same then onthe whiteboard or I could go again Icould say you know he's the table he'sanother plane I can put lines on therethat don't meet and only goes on topower if I come off the tablelike standing up okay it's not gonnameet but it's not parallel okay allright that's parallel lines we need onemore word to be able to describesomething in relation to these becauseseeing as parallel lines never makethey're kind of boring actually it'slike can you imagine a movie in the twocharacters they never meet they neverinteract with each other it's like greatgreat great relationship characterdevelop they're rightparalyzed on the road not thatinteresting but when you get a line thatgoes across both parallel lines and wecall them transversals okay theninteresting stuff have interestingpatterns happen okay so transversals arewell a transversal is sorry I should saythat a transversal is a line it willalways do is cross the other twoparallel lines that crosses two Isuppose you could do more if you liketwo or more parallel lines
