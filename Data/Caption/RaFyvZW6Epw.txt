If you have a picture of the graph of the
function, you can find discontinuities justby looking for breaks in the graph.These could be point discontinuities like
this, jump discontinuities like this, infinitediscontinuities like this, or endpoint discontinuities
like this.When you're tracing the graph from one side
to the other, if you ever come to any pointwhere you have to pick up your pencil in order
to keep drawing the next section, then there'sa discontinuity at that point.When you have an endpoint like this, it's
discontinuous because the general limit doesn'texist.The right hand limit exists because as we
trace the graph from the right side towardthe left, we approach a value of 2.But there's no left hand limit because there's
no graph to the left of this point.And since there's only a right hand limit
and no left hand limit, it means there's nogeneral limit.And since there's no general limit, the function
is technically discontinuous at the endpoint.When you have an asymptote on the end like
this, there's no discontinuity at this point.The function is still continuous here.In order for there to be a discontinuity at
an asymptote, the graph has to exist on bothsides of the asymptote, and since the graph
does not exist to the right of this asymptote,there's no discontinuity here.So what if you don't have a picture of the
graph, but you have the equation of the functionitself?Then how do you know where the function has
discontinuities?Well rational functions, which are fractions
with polynomials in the numerator and denominator,like all of these, are the most common types
of functions to have discontinuities.Because fractions are undefined when the denominator
is zero, any value that makes the denominatorzero is going to make a discontinuity in the
function.If the zero value can be canceled out of the
denominator, then it's a point discontinuity.If it can't be canceled out, then it's an
infinite discontinuity.If we take this rational function as an example,
we can see that it'll have discontinuitiesat x=2 and at x=6, because both of those values
make the denominator zero.If we factor the numerator, we can cancel
out the x-2, but not the x-6.Because we were able to remove the x-2, it
means that x=2 is a point, or removable, discontinuity.Since we couldn't factor out the x-6, it means
x=6 is an infinite, or nonremovable, discontinuity.If we sketch the curve, we can see the point
discontinuity at x=2, and the infinite discontinuity(which is just a vertical asymptote, by the
way), at x=6.You can also get discontinuities from piecewise
defined functions.For this piecewise function, y=x defines the
curve to the left of x=3, and at x=3 itself.And y=4 defines the function to the right
of x=3.If we sketch these curves, we can see that
there's a discontinuity at the break pointof x=3.So to summarize, if you're looking for discontinuities
in the function and you have a picture ofthe graph, just look for any point where you
have to pick up your pencil, or look for endpoints,and all those points will be your discontinuities.If you don't have the graph but your function
is a rational function, look for values thatmake the denominator zero.These will be point discontinuities if you
can factor them out, or infinite discontinuitiesif you can't.If your function is a piecewise function,
then look at each piece separately for discontinuities,but make sure to look also at the break point
between the conditions.If the functions don't meet each other at
the same value, then there's a jump discontinuityat that point.
