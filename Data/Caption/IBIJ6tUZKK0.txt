one of the four special types of pointsof concurrency inside a triangle is thein Center the in center is the point ofconcurrency of the three angle bisectorsit is also the center of an inscribedcircle so if we looked at this sketchright here we have a triangle and wehave a circle that's inscribed insidethat triangle so that means that thistriangle is intersected by the circleonly three times and that the center ofthat circle is therefore the samedistance from the three sides so I canmark these three segments as beingcongruent and I'm measuring this along aperpendicular from that center of thecircle to the side so three key thingsabout the in-center is that it's theangle bisectors that make it it's thecenter of the inscribed circle which hasthe result of being equidistant from thethree sides of your triangle
