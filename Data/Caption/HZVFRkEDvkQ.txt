hello my name is Maria from mathmammoths calm in this lesson we'restudying volume now volume means howmuch space something takes okay and wemeasure it in cubic units I have here afew examples cubic units are always inthe shape of a cube and this little cubehere is made so that its side here isone inch and then this here the heightwould be one inch and this way also oneinch and then we call it one cubic inchokay we can abbreviate one cubic inch intwo ways for example one and then in usfour inch and then an elevated three orone Cu I in this elevated three probablyreminds you of area units where we hadsquare inches and square centimeters andwe had an elevated - okay when we'remeasuring area we have two dimensions todeal with the width and the length butwith volume we have three dimensions wehave the width here and then height andthen this way the death okay so that'swhere this three comes from is anothercubic unit this time one cubiccentimeter so there we would have onecentimeter hereone centimeter for the death and onecentimeter for the height and theabbreviation is 1 cm elevated three onecubic centimeter and here's one cubicfoot so that means this is one foot thisis one foot and the height all threedimensions are one foot and you canabbreviate it as ft elevated 3 but don'tread it that wayit is cubic foot okay oh one cu.ft andbesides these there are other cubicunits too because if you had here onemeter one meter one meter you would getone cubic meter and so on another thingsyou'll need to understand is the volumeof a box or of a rectangular prism andlet's look at some examples here that Imade basically the idea here isthat instead of counting the Box one byone you can just look how many are hereon the bottom and then go that's manytimes how many layers up it goes there'stwo on the bottom and then two layers upin this one so a total of four rightyeah we have two on the bottom and thenwe have one two three four five layersup so five times two is ten blocksThank You bikinis pseudo are here youcan look at the bottom and even thebottom you can find out by multiplyingyou can find how many books there are bymultiplying 2 times 3 right and that isyour width and your depth with time step2 times 3 is 6 and then another layer of6 6 times 2 is 12 so even if I add heremore you can still see the sameprinciple we can even look at the bottomand go 2 times 3 to find how many bookson the bottom layer and then that times3 the height to get the total volume ofthis rectangular prism now let's figurethe volume of these two rectangularprismsthey're basically boxes box shapedfigures and they are already dividedinto little cubic units so actually it'svery easy to figure out the volume youjust count 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so the volumeis 8 cubic units but I also want to lookat the width and height and the depthfor this particular one the width hereis 4 units the depth this way is justone unit at the height 2 units we canmultiply those to get the volume thetotal volume okay 4 times 1 times 2equals 8 so the volume is 8 but it's notunits alone for the volume we say it is8 cubic units ok or if this were youknow so many centimeters or so manyinches whatever then I would use here 8cubic centimeters 8 cubic inches whatthen this one again we can multiplythose three dimensions to get the totalvolume for example if I want to know howmany blocks are here in the bottom row Iwill have two times two four in thebottom row and then I would go thattimes the height how many layers thereare I would go 4 times 3 equals 12 thewidth here is 2 units then the death is2 also 2 units and the height is 3 unitsyou can multiply this and get 12 cubicunits 12 little cubes stacked to formthis figure this rectangular prism
