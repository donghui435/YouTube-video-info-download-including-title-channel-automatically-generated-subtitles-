hey this is Mario with Mario's mathtutoring can we do another math theaterto help you boost your score in yourmath class improve your understandingand hopefully make learning math a lotless stressful so what we're going totalk about in this video is how tostretch shift translate you know reflectall the different types oftransformations that you can do withparent functions so let's get right intothis video and look at some examples sofirst of all you want to familiarfamiliarize yourself with a lot of thesebasic graphs if you recognize the basicshape of the graph and the basicequation that's the starting point solet's just go through real quick this isthe square root function and it lookslike a half a parabola on its side thisis the absolute value function and itlooks like a real sharp V with thevertex at the origin this is called thereciprocal function because it's not axbut 1 over X and you can see it'sactually a hyperbola it approaches the xand y axes y equals x cubed this is thegreatest integer function it looks likesteps and then of course y equals xsquared that's our u-shaped graph ourparabola but now let's talk abouttransforming these graphs so let's juststart with this one over here y equalssquare root of x say for example wewanted to graph y equals square root ofx minus 2 what do you think the 2 doesto the graph well if you said shiftsright you're right basically the way youwant to think about it is whatevernumber is grouped with the X is going toshift the graph okay in the x-directionit's gonna affect the X or thehorizontal direction but it's theopposite from you know what it lookslike so if it's minus 2 it actuallyshifts it right positive 2 if this wasplus 2 it actually would shift left 2 sojust to show you on this graph here thisis actually going to be shifting yourgraph right 1 2 and there's our graph okso you're with me so far let's look atanother example let's say we have yequals absolute value of x okay say wewanted to graph y equals x plus 3 sowhat do you think the plus 3 does to theto the graph the parent function okay ifyou said shifts left 3 you're right okayand again notice how see it's groupedwith the ax right it's grouped with theax if it's having the opposite effectit's actually shifting the graph left 3so now the vertex is over here atnegative 3 everything shifted left 3okay let's go to the next graph y equals1 over X what we're gonna do now iswe're going to multiply okay by 2 sobasically what i did as i said this is 2times 1 over x what do you think the 2does to this graph if you said avertical shift and that vertical shiftI'm sorry a vertical stretch meaningyou're multiplying all the Y values by 2you're exactly right and so what wouldhappen is normally this graphic goesthrough the point 1 1 okay you can seeif you put 1 in here that's 1 but nowit's going to be stretching it's goingto be up here at 2 same thing over hereat negative 1 it's going to be atnegative 2 so what's happening is okayit's a vertical stretch like you pulledon it in this direction okay now hang inthere with me I'm going to show you somegeneral concepts let's go to the nextone here y equals x cubed now what youcan do is you can write any of theseparent functions in a more general waylike this y equals a X minus H cubedplus K so what we've already kind of youknow gotten familiar with here is thatthe number that's group with the X isaffecting the X Direction right if it'sminus 2 its shifting right to if it'splus 2 it's left to the one this groupof the X has the opposite effect this Kvalue here has the same effect if youadd 2 to the graph is going to shift itup two if you subtract two it's going toshift it down 2 and then this numberhere in front the a is going to stretchit vertically or if it's less than 1like 1/2 or 1/3 it's going to compressit ok so you're with me so far so let'slook at an example let's say we wantedto graph y equals 1/2 x cubed plus 2 allright so what we can see here is thatwe're going to be multiplying the Yvalues by 1/2 so that's a verticalcompression and we're going to bepicking up the graph and shifting it upto now what a lot of students will dookay and a lot of teachers are recommendis they'll say okay we know this isshifting up to so let's think of thispoint here as our starting point sowe've taken the 2 into account whatwe'll do now is we'll focus in on thiscore function here and we're going tomake a table of values we're just goingto say like x and y we're going to picksome easy values right so if I putnegative 1 that's negative 1 cubed times1/2negative half one would be a positivehalf and 0b0 but what you're going to doinstead of graphing from the originyou're going to treat this point likethe origin so here is zero zero here'sone 1/2 and here's negative one negative1/2 so now the graph looks like this andwhat you can see is it's been compressedand it's been shifted up to okay let'slook at another example let's take alook at this step function here say wewanted to graph y equals negative ok nowagain you're probably seeing the patternok here we're multiplying everything bynegative one so what does that do to theY values it makes them the opposite soit's reflecting over the x-axis ok sonow what will happen with this graph isinstead of the stairs going like so okaythey're going to be reflecting over thex-axis and they're going to be goingthis direction okay and these ones aregonna be up here okay are you with me sofar ok let's look at y equals x squaredlet's say we wanted to graph y equalstwo x squared now the thing to payattention to is you see how the 2 isgrouped with the X when it's groupedwith the X it affects the X directionbut in the opposite fashion okay howeveryou want to say that so basicallyinstead of multiplying X's by two you'reactually dividing them by 2 so whathappens is just this is actually goingto be a horizontal compression okay sobasically what's going to happen here isnormally the graph goes through 0 0 1 1but now it's going to be 1/2 1 andnegative 1/2 1 so basically what we didis we compressed it that way and you cansee it's like being squished or hey okhorizontally so let's look at some otherexamples now I want to make a little bitmore challenging for you so let's sayfor example like say for example youtook back to the square root of xfunction say we wanted to graph y equals3 square root of x plus 2 minus 1 ok soyou can see that this is actually goingto shift the graphleft - it's going to be a verticalstretch by three and then it's going tobe shifted down one now the reason I didit that way is because I'm following theorder of operations parenthesesexponents multiplication divisionaddition subtraction or you can thinkabout working from the inside out okaybut I think about the order ofoperations so if you wanted to do thiskind of like a knob slow mole okay rightslow motion you start with the basicgraph here okay now you might say toyourself Mario I don't know the basicgraph well just go ahead and make atableokay just using that core graph and picksome values zero the square root of 0 is0 1 is 1 4 is 2 9 is 3 these are yourbasic points okay so then you can plotthose and then you say hmm I'm going tosubtract 2 from all the x-coordinate soif I subtract 2 from these now I'll beat negative 2 0 okay I'm going to be atnegative 1 1 okay and so now I can seemy graphs looking something like likethis shifted left 2 now I'm going to betaking all the Y values and multiplyingby 3 this is a vertical stretch soinstead of being at you know negative 11 I'm going to be at negative 1 3 sothis point right here is actually goingto be moving up 1 2 3 it's going to belike this so this is a vertical stretchok and then I'm going to be shifting thewhole thing minus 1 down 1 somebodysubtracting 1 from all the Y values soeach of these points is going to go down1 down 1 and so on so now the graphlooks like thatok now you might say that sounds like alot of work right so let's do it anotherway so this is another way that studentsand teachers will approach it they'llsay hmm let's just take the shift intoaccount first let's just say okay weknow this is going to shift left 2 anddown 1 right so let's just treat thatpoint like our starting point like ourorigin so we've taken those guys intoaccount now all we have to do is graphthis kind of core graph or core equationor core function but from this point notthe origin that makes a lot simpler soyou make a table again pick some easyvalues that you can take the square rootof 0 1 & 4 square root of 0 0 times 3 is0 square root of 1 is 1 times 3 is 3square root of 4 is 2 times 3 is 6now all we have to do is plot thesepoints from here so zero zero right oneup three okay and then right four threefour up six okay so you can see thatthis graph is the same graph that we gotover here so depending on how yourteacher wants you to do it if they saydescribe the order of transformationsyou do the order of operations you sayokay it's shifting left to verticalstretch by three and then shifting downone but if all you have to do is graphit I recommend doing the translation thetranslation is what you're picking upand you're shifting it that's like arigid transformation and then treat thatlike your starting point cover up thosevalues that were involved in the shiftand then just graph the core functionfrom there so remember adding andsubtracting pick up and shift the wrathokay multiplying and dividing stretch orcompress and the key thing to rememberis that if it's grouped with the X ithas the opposite effect so if you'remultiplying here by two you actuallydivide the x-coordinates by two if youwere dividing by two say it was likethis you would actually be multiplyingX's about the X values by chuse would itbe a horizontal stretch same thing withadding and subtracting like if yousubtract two you're going right to ifyou add two you're going left two but ifit's not group with the ax like say Iput one over here that's going to shiftup one if I change it to minus one it'sgoing to shift down one if I put a fourin front that's gonna be a verticalstretch okay affecting the Y values bymultiplying by four and if it's a halfit's going to be compressing itvertically and then the last is if it'sa negative it's gonna be reflecting overthe x-axis now one last onebonus tip right say for example it'slike this y equals negative x now seehow that negatives group with the Xvalues okay with the X this is affectingthe X values it's making all the Xvalues the opposite this is actuallygoing to reflect or the y-axis so it'sgoing to reflect like this okay whereasif the negatives in front that's goingto affect the Y values it's going tomultiply all the Y values by negativeone and we reflected over the x-axis soa lot of information here start byreally learning the parent functions andthen go from thereso this concludes this video subscribeto the channel check out some my
