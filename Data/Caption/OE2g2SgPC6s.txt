in this video we're talking about how tofind the perimeter of a triangle andremember that the perimeter of anyobject is just the distance around theedge of the object so if you imaginethat you walked around the edge allaround the outside how far would youtravel basically and that's the idea ofperimeter we have a couple examples hereof triangles and we're gonna have to usethe Pythagorean theorem to find one edgeof the triangle that we don't knowremember that you can only use thePythagorean theorem when you're dealingwith a right triangle which remember isa triangle that includes a 90 degreeangle so in this first example here wehave a right triangle it includes a 90degree angle that's been indicated hereand we've been told that this left legof the triangle is three units that thelength of the hypotenuse is 5 units butthis side here this leg is unknown wellif we want to find the perimeter we'regoing to need to be able to add up thelengths of each of the sides and wecan't do that until we find the lengthof this unknown side the way that we'regoing to do that is using thePythagorean theorem and remember thatthe Pythagorean theorem tells us that asquared plus B squared is equal to Csquared when we say that a and B are thelengths of the two legs and C is thelength of the hypotenuse so if we goahead and say that three is one of thelegs of the triangle and we plug that infor a we're gonna get three squared B isthe length of the unknown leg here sowe're gonna go ahead and leave that Bsquared and then we know that the lengthof the hypotenuse is 5 C is always thehypotenuse so we go ahead and plug in 5for seeing the hypotenuse when wesimplify we're going to get 9 plus Bsquared is equal to 25 when we subtract9 from both sides we're gonna get Bsquared is equal to 16 and when we takethe square root of both sides we get Bis equal to 4 so we can say that thisside length is equal to 4 then to findthe perimeter we just add the three sidelengths together so we say 3 plus 4 plus5 and that's going to be 7 and 12 isgoing to be the perimeter of thetriangle what about this second examplehere we've been given this triangle weknow that the length of this side is 17units that the length of this side is 10units but we don't know the length ofthe base so we're going to need to findthatin order to find the perimeter of thistriangle how are we gonna go aboutfinding the length of the base thistriangle here is not a right trianglebut as you notice we can divide thistriangle into two separate righttriangles so on the left-hand side ofthis dashed line here we have a righttriangle we know it's a right trianglebecause we've been told here that thisis a right angle which means that thisis also a right angle so everything onthe left here is a right triangle andeverything on the right is a righttriangle so we can deal with themseparately use the Pythagorean theoremto find the length of each base and thenadd the basis together to get the lengthof the total base and then we'll be ableto find perimeter so let's go ahead andcall this side the base on the left-handside B sub 1 or the first base and thiswe'll call B sub 2 or the second base soif we want to find the base of thetriangle on the left here everything tothe left of this dashed line rememberwe'll use the Pythagorean theorem andwe'll say that one leg is going to beeight so we'll say that a is equal toeight so we'll say eight squared plus Bsub 1 squared is going to be equal to atthe length of the hypotenuse squared so17 squared when we simplify we'll get 64plus B sub 1 squared is equal to 17squared is 289 when we subtract 64 fromboth sides we're going to get B sub 1squared is equal to 225 and then when wetake the square root of both sides weget B sub 1 is equal to the square rootof 225 which is 15 so we can say B sub 1is going to be equal to 15 now whatabout the length of the base of thetriangle on the right hand side herewell again we've got a right triangle sowe can use the Pythagorean theorem weknow that a and the Pythagorean theoremis going to be equal to 8 that's thelength of one leg so we can say 8squared plus B sub 2 squared is going tobe equal to the hypotenuse squared inthis case 10 squared so here we're goingto get 64 plus B sub 2 squared is equalto 100 when we subtract 64 from bothsides we're going to get 36 and thenwhen we take the square root of bothsides we're going to get B sub 2 isequal to the square root of 3six or six so now we know that B sub 2is equal to 6 so if we want the lengthof the entire base then obviously we'rejust going to add 15 and 6 together 15plus 6 is going to give us 21 so thelength of the base then is 21 so then tofind perimeter we just take the lengthof each of the three sides and add themtogether so we'll say 17 plus 10 plus 21the length of the base that we found andthat's going to be 48 and so we can saythat the perimeter of this triangle is48 units
