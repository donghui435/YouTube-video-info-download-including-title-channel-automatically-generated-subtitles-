- [Voiceover] What I would like to dois find the area of this green triangle.And if you get so inspired,and I encourage you to get inspired,pause the video and see if you canfigure it out on your own.So whenever you start thinking aboutareas of triangle, or least my brain says,well look, I can figure
out the area of a triangleif I know the base and the
height of the triangle.I can just multiply them and thenmultiply that by one half.So, for example, if I have a trianglethat looks like this.A triangle that looks like this.And if, if this is the base,this is b right over here.The length of this side is b.I'm gonna put the b in magenta.And then the height, let
me do that in yellow.This is the height.This is the height.Then I just multiply base
times height times one halfand I'll get the area of this triangle.Or if the triangle looked like this.If it looked like,if it looked like this.If it looked like this, I
could do the same thing.Where if this is the base, b.So that is the base b.And now the height, I guess you couldsay this, if you were to dropa penny from here, it's
sitting outside the triangle.So it looks different from this one.But this would still be the height.This would still be the height.Right over here, ya do the same thing.One half times base times heightwould give you the area of this triangle.So how can we apply that over here?Well, this triangle is on this grid,but it's kind of at an angle.With this grid it's hard to pick outthe base and the height.for this triangle as a whole.But what we could do,
there's actually several waysthat we can approach this.Is we can break this triangle upinto two or more triangles where we canfigure out the base and the
height for each of them.So for example, I can break this one.Let's see I could, I'm picking this pointand this point because it breaks it upinto two triangles where I can figure outthe base and the height.Well what am I talking about?Well this triangle over here, that I amshading in blue.If I, and I've switched the orientation.I've rotated 90 degrees.But if you view this yellow.If you view this yellow as the baseof this triangle, you see
that the base is three.So, let me write the base
is equal to three units.And what's the height here?Well the height here is going to beThe height here is going to be thisdistance right over here, which is four.Height is equal to four.So the area, the area of that triangleright over there, is going to be one halftimes three times four,
which is equal to six.So this part right over here,the area is six.And now we can do a similar thingwith this other triangle.'Cause once again, we can view thisyellow line, or now I have
this yellow and blue line,as the base.The base is equal to three.So I could write that
base is equal to three.And once again, I've rotated.So now the base is on the side.So the base is three.And then the height here,the height of this triangleis two.If this is the base, remember
if this is the base herewe've just rotated it.Then this right over here is the heightHeight would be equal to two.So what's the area of this one?The area of this one is going to beone half times the base, three, timesthe height which is two.One half times two is one times three.This is going to be equal to three.So the area of the whole thing isgonna be this area of threeplus this area of six.It's gonna be the area of nine.Area is equal to nine.Now that's one way you could do it.Is you could just break
it up into triangleswhere you could figure out
the base and the height.Another way, and this is you can kindaview it as a maybe a trickier way.Or ya kinda have to think a little bitoutside of the box, or maybe
outside of the triangleto do it this way.Is to, instead of doing it this way,visualize this triangle.And actually, let me, let me
clean this up a little bit.Let me undo all this work that I just did.Let me undo this to show
you the other approach.The other way that we can tackle this.So, the other way we could tackle it.I'm gonna clean up the whole thing,so I get more, so I get
more real estate here.So the other way that we could tackle itis imagine that this triangle is embeddedinside of our rectangle.So let me draw the rectangle.Let me draw a, let me draw
the broader rectangle.And I think you might
see where this is going.'Cause as soon as you draw that,that bigger rectangle, then you seethat that rectangle is made up ofthe triangle that we're
tryin' to find the area of,and three other right triangles.We have this right trianglethat I'm shading in in yellow.We have this right triangle that I'mshading in, in purple.And then we have this right triangle,that I am shading in, in blue.So if we figure out the area
of the entire rectangle,and that's pretty straightforward.The area of the entire rectangleis gonna be four times six,those little mentions of the rectangle.Four times six.So the area of the entire rectangle is 24.And then you subtract out the areaof the purple, the blue
and the yellow rectangles.The purple, the blue and
the yellow triangles,then you're gonna be left with thearea of the green triangle.So let's do that.So what's the area of the purple one?Well this is going to be,we're gonna subtract it out.It's gonna be one half,six, the height right over here.If we view this as a height of six.And it's a base, right over here is three.So it's gonna be one half times sixtimes three, that's the
area of the purple triangle.And then you have the blue one.This is going to be minus one half.Let's see, you could say height is one.So this is one.And then this base, you could say is four.So that's four times four.And then we want to subtract outthe area of the yellow rectangle.So this is minus one half.Let's see we could make this base two.One half times two times,and this height is four.Two times four.So what's this gonna be?Well, let's see, one half
times six times three.That's three times three.That's going to be nine.One half times one times four.That's going to be two.And then one half times two times four.Well that's just going to be four.And so we're left with 24 minus
nine minus two minus four.So, this we're gonna do the same color.Minus four, so what is that?24 minus nine is 15.15 minus two is 13.13 minus four is equal to nine.It's equal to nine.So that's the other way, or another wayto get the area of this green triangle.
