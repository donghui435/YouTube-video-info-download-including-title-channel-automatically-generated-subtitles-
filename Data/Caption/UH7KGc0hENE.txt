hello my name is Maria and this ismathie my mascot in this lesson we'regonna study meters and kilometers whichboth are units for measuring lengths ordistances and one meter is equal to 100centimeters and I'm gonna show it to younow using this measuring tape okay overhere we need to go all the way up tonumber 100 to see one meter can you seethat I also drew one meter here on theboardthis first Purple Line is exactly onemeter and then I also have one meterhere on my carpet and now I'm gonna nowI'm gonna take a step of exactly onemeter like that and then back as you cansee I need to I need to take a littlebit of effort to do that it's not soeasy but now let me take steps of half ameter each that's easier that's morelike normal walking for me but of courseif you're a child and when you try thisit will be a little bit more difficultfor you to step one meter Oh Matthewwants to try it too okay go ahead mathyjump one meter well try again nothingOh Matthew I think you need to practiceyour landing son well come up here nowI'm gonna measure how long this purpleline is but before I do I want you toguess how long is it and remember thatthis is one meter long so now you canmake a guess how long is this other lineI'm gonna use my roller that measures incentimeters and this one goes only up to60 centimeters so I need to make alittle mark here that's 60 centimetersand then of course 40 more 60 and 40would make one meter but that's my onemeter mark and then some more over hereit's 60 and then even beyond that just alittle bit 2 centimeters more so I gotone meter and 62 centimeters so what'syour guess close and like I mentionedkilometers are used for long distancesfor example between towns betweencountries and one kilometer is actuallya thousand meters so that's quite a bitremember that jump I made the 1 meterjump takes 1,000 of those and thenthat's one kilometer now lastly we aregonna figure out what unit of length wewould use for these things and ourchoices are either centimeter meter orkilometer you remember centimeters arethe smallest units those you have onyour ruler and meters you remember theone meter jump I did or this line is ameter and thank Allah meters onekilometer is a thousand meters so that'sthe longest the biggest unit how longyour little finger is okaywell that surely would be centimeter yescm length of a train ok it has all thesewagons and carokay long thing meters yes around theearth if you go all the way around ourglobe we would measure it in kilometersyesthe biggest unit length of a footballfield or a baseball field for thatmatter we would take the medium onemeters width of a table it could be thiswide maybe I can use centimeters rightbut if your table is longer maybe itwould be like one meter and somecentimeters so you could use meters andcentimeters too length of a skirt howlong is your skirt centimeters yes howdeep a pool is over here you could usecentimeters or it could be that youwould use meters and centimeters likeone meter and 60 centimeters orsomething like that so I'll put herecentimeters meters for example a polemight be 2 meters 10 centimeters deepthe water there from Chicago to New Yorkto towns so that's a long distance andwe use kilometers right lastly mathy howlong is mathie what would we use tomeasure mathywell he is much less than 1 meter rightso we better use centimeters like allother stuffed animals what is it messyoh he's saying that he's many meterslong he's a mammoth well maybe you thinkso but I don't think so I think okaydoes it go up on my shoulder way alldone with this listen
