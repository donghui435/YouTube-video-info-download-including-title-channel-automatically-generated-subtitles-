if you've ever looked at a map of theUnited States you might wonder how eachstate obtained its size and shape thereare many historical and politicalreasons for the way the u.s. was carvedup but what if we wanted to redefinestate borders in a way that made moremathematical sense one way to do this isto draw the boundaries such that eachstate only contains the points which arecloser to that States Capitol than toany other state Capitol using thismethod Manhattan would be in New Jerseybecause Manhattan is closer to Trentonthan it is to Albany and Chicago wouldbe in Wisconsin because it is closer toMadison than it is to Springfield nowsome states would gain a lot of arealike New Mexico and Utah other stateswould not be so luckysorry California this new map is anexample of a bore annoyed diagram aVoronoi diagram is a way of partitioninga plane into regions called cells basedon distance to a specific group ofpoints called seeds each cell contains aseed and the points in the cell arecloser to that sleeve than to any otherseed in our state boundaries example thestate capitals are the seeds and thestates are the cells Voronoi diagramsare used in a variety of disciplinesfrom biology to architecture in factthere is a regular conference dedicatedto applications of Voronoi diagrams inscience and engineering consider aclassic problem solved by using Bohrannoyed diagrams canuse post officeproblem given the location of nearbypost offices which one is closest toyour house to solve this construct aVoronoi diagram by letting the postoffices be the seeds find the cellcontaining your house the correspondingseed is the closest post office ofcourse instead of talking about postoffices we could be considering airportsthere are almost 3,000 large and mediumsized airports in the world thinking ona global scale making a Voronoi diagramfor this many locations could be quitetime-consuming even with the help ofcomputers this graphic can help youdetermine the closest airport to anylocation in the worldconsider a different problem a tacostand chain wants to build a newlocation in a city where is the bestlocation for the new stands to decreasecompetition the taco stand should bebuilt in a location where the distanceto the nearest taco stand is maximizedall other factors being equal to solvethis first draw a Voronoi diagram of thetaco stands now draw a line betweenevery two taco stands whose cells haveadjacent edges the cells in this newgraph are all triangles and we call thenew graph a de l'ann¨¦e triangulation animportant fact about its Alanitriangulation is that none of its seedslie inside the circumcircle of anytriangle in the graph since none ofthese circumcircle z' contain a tacostand the ideal place to build a newtaco stand is at the center of thelargest circumcirclethis maximizes the distance to anyexisting taco stand if the city limitslie outside the circumcircle thefurthest point may be on the boundarylet's consider another problem which canbe solved using a de l'ann¨¦etriangulation six friends want to figureout which two of them live closesttogether if you want to solve this bycomparing every pair of locations thereare 15 pairs to check instead let'screate a Voronoi diagram where the seedsare the set of homes and then a del'ann¨¦e triangulation the edge thatconnects each seed to its closestneighbor must be in the de l'ann¨¦etriangulation this means that you onlyhave to check the pair's which are sidesof triangles in the de l'ann¨¦etriangulation in this example that meansten pairs instead of fifteen pairs thenumber of edges in a de l'ann¨¦etriangulation is usually much smallerthan the number of edges connecting allthe seeds as the number of friendsvaries this is the number of pairs themaximum number of edges in a de l'ann¨¦etriangulation with this number of seedsis much smaller or huge friend groupsthe size of the search can be reduceddramaticallyI think Voronoi diagrams are greatshould we declare the United States offoreign oil[Music][Music]
