[Music]so about a week ago I came across thisimage now this is a single piece ofstring that is looped around a loom tomake a version of El Greco's Jesus and Ithought this is super awesome the nameof the artist that did this is Petrosrellis I've linked to his site below youcan also purchase some of his art Ibelieve I just want to be 100% clearthat this is not my original ideahowever Patras claims that to use somesort of algorithm that would input theimage and then tell him how to loop hisstring around the Loom and he has notmade this algorithm public so I thoughtthis could be a very fun project tofigure out it involves some art itinvolves some problem solving itinvolves some computer science allthings that I absolutely love so let'sdo this to get started you do need toknow how to program any language is fineand if you don't know how to program Ithink this is a fantastic first projectto start with because at the end of ityou get something beautiful out of it solet me just explain the idea so startwith a black and white image so here isan image of one of my cats and the nextthing I'm going to do is imagine placingnails in the picture wherever your nailsare going to be in the end product solet's say we randomly start with thisnail the question is what is the nextnail I want to go to one way to thinkabout it is that well since I am usingblack string the part of the image thatI go over when I connect one nail to theother should be as dark as possible Icertainly don't want to be going overyou know the lighter part of her irisright off the bat so what you can do isyou can look at the pixels that yourstring would go over you know just lookat the pixels that your string would beoverlapping and see how dark they are soyou can scale them on a scale from zeroto one where zero is completely whiteand one is a full black and then you cancompute an average of the darkness ofall the pixels that you go over and ifyou do this for every single nail thenail that you pick is the one where thestring will go over the darkest pixelson averagenow all you have to do is set all of thepixels that your string went over towhite and start the whole process againthe reason we're setting those pixels towhite is to stop the algorithm fromretread and ground we don't want it togo over the same stuff over and overagain we want it to process other partsof the picture actually let me just puttwo demonstrations side-by-side one withthe picture and one without the picturejust so you can very easily see exactlywhat is going on here and like I saidyou just do this process over and overagain until you are satisfied with whatyou have and it seems to me that youdon't really need anything fancier thanthis because to my eye that actuallylooks pretty goodnow cats and computer simulations areall well and good but if I was going todo this for real if I was gonna actuallysit down and spend six to eight hourslooping string around nails it wouldhave to be with something that had a fargreater emotional resonance andsignificance to me I started by placingmy nails in the pattern of an egg forobvious reasonsafter that I wrote something so that mycomputer would actually read thesequence of a nails off to me one afteranother after a sufficient delay and therest of it is I think prettyself-explanatory[Music][Music][Music]and I have to say I am very very pleasedwho would the results of this one I'mvery proud of this and I think goodnessit's been about nine months since I'vedone a mathematical art project stylevideo and I'm just so so happy with theway that this one turned out now if youenjoyed this video or if it feels likeyou might enjoy listening to me talkabout stuff that I like feel free tocheck out my other videos and subscribeto the channel peace[Music]
