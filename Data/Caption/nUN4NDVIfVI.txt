KR: Well, the usual way that people, um, discuss
it is to talk about perfect squares first.So, if you have studied the Pythagorean
Theoremthere's a formula that the square of the hypotenuse is the sum of the two squares of thesides of a right triangle. So you might
ask if the, err,the sides of a right triangle are whole
numbersmight it happen that the hypotenuseis also a whole number. 
They're called Pythagorean triples and the Greeksfigured out all of the Pythagorean Triples. Okay,
so what happened next isI think it must have been very natural
to look at the equationA cubed plus B cubed equals C cubed andA to the fourth plus B fourth equals C to the fourth.And so on. So, this is now in the realm of
algebraand you can plug in values for 'A' and 'B'
you'll see that, err,these equations, infinite number of
equations, seemnot to have solutions. Well, so the
story is thatFermat was reading the text of Diophantus,who was the Greek mathematician best known
for this type of problem.And in the margin of his copyof Diophantus, he wrote some marginal note
sayingthat I can prove it for higher exponents
bigger than two there are no positiveinteger solutionsand then famously he said but my solutionis too long to write in this margin.And in his copy of Diophantus which
wasinherited by Fermat's son Samuel de Fermatthere are many, many marginal notes and
Samuel published a revised version,annotated version of Diophatus'sBook in which all his father's writings
arereproduced. And the reason that Fermat's
Last Theorem was called Fermat's LastTheorem, is that all the previously on examined
marginal notesproved to be correct for they were, ermmprove to be correct or incorrect mostly
correct bymathematicians after the
seventeenth-century and there was thisonly one assertion that remained it was the last
one was hit list.And you know again, I'm not an expert inthe history of mathematics but I think most
peopleare convinced that when Fermat was
a mature mathematician he realized hedid have no proofof this thing that he wrote in the marginal
note and in factlater in his life he devoted a lot of
attentionto special cases of that type of equation.It's not just the cubes but it's the cubes
the fourth powers and the fifth powersand so on.And Fermat himself later in his lifetook care the fourth powers.Well, the cubes
certainly must'vebothered him because after all he knew
about squares and he knew about fourthpowers and cubes,you know, right in the middle.BH: The theory is that
there is no solution.There's no whole number solution.KR: That's right.BH: Would it have been or wouldn't it have been more exciting or moreattractive to a mathematicianto prove him wrong and to find these three
numbers that you could plug in that woulddo it? Would that have been more triumphant?KR: Well, it would have been-would have been very exciting and would
have made lots of news.And then the proof, so to speak, would
have been simplyon a single counter-example that would
have fit,you know, very neatly in a newspaper
column, you known, there would have beensome story, you know.'Mathematician in Australia finds the
first counter-example to Fermat's LastTheorem'.  Certainly was big news either
way.Ermm, the main thing about Fermat's Last
Theorem is that over the centuries itgave rise to a tremendous amountof new, and fruitful mathematics. That people
really develop new techniques to try tosolve that equationthat proved to be, you know,infinitely versatile. BH: So a bit like going to
the moon and let[ting] them develop otherlots of other technologies along the way. This was forgoing to the moon. KR: That's a-that's a fine
analogy. I mean,you, when you formulate a problem in
mathematics no one knowswhether this problem will really be
helpful for mathematics as a general enterprise.And, you know, for whatever reason Fermat's equationhas led to tremendous amount of- of new mathematicsKR: So, when I was a graduate student. We're
talking, you know, roughly forty years ago orforty-five years ago. Fermat's Last Theorem
was kindasome curiosity. Everybody knew about
the problem but no one really had anyapproach to it and there was nokinda fundamental reason why the problem
was going to have a positive solution.And when I was a student there was a
tremendous interest in what are calledelliptic curves and it was realizedaround nineteen sixty-eight, nineteen sixty-nine, nineteen seventyby Andr¨¦ Weil and Goro Shimura in
Princetonwho built on work of Yutaka Taniyama who was hisbuddy in Tokyo in the nineteen-fifties.
Taniyamahad passed away and there was this
gradual understanding that ellipticcurves really were relatedmodular forms and again that was some
completelyare apparently inaccessible outstanding
conjectureanalysts thought to be incredibly hard
conjecture. And thenin the early nineteen-eighties a
mathematician came around, and I say thatliterally because you know he was
sitting here in this officehis name is Gerhard Frey. At the time he
was at the Universityof Saarland in Saarbr¨¹cken onand he came-  BH: Is that a famous one? I don't know that one.KR: Well, um, I didn't know it either and came around
and he hadthe scheme for relating Fermat's Last Theoremand the modularity conjecture. Somehow herealized for the first time that,um, if- if he had a solution to Fermat's equationthis would give him an elliptic curve
which apparentlycould never be modular. I was a little
skepticalbecause I knew that some of the things
that he saidthat he needed in his argument, um, were
very hard.Well, for me a really important thing wasin nineteen eighty-five Jean-Pierre Serre, who wasone of my mathematical heroes in Paris
sat down and kind of tried todistill everything that had been said
about the Prey's ideaand he came out with a very clearletter and this letter basically said if
you can prove this tiny little resultwhich he called epsilon because the numberin calculus, epsilon is a small number. He
said if you can prove this tiny little epsilonthen you can really show that on the
modularity conjecture, which he calledWeil at the time,implies Fermat's Last Theorem. So, epsilonbecame, for me, a holy grail becausenot only was it something fairly well
encapsulated and veryclear, and this was the kind of thing that
I'd thought about beforewithout success but nonetheless while
thinking about yet anotherproblem, it occurred to me that I really
had some new information that I couldpossibly bring to bear on this epsilon.When I first did was say to myself: "What's
the simplest possible case where I canthink about this? What's the simplest
possible prediction?"I tried to settle that. I said "Well, you
know, if you have to start somewhere.can I-" Well, I know about this simplest
caseso I have this thing in my mind and I
thought about it,off and on, during the academic year-nineteen eighty-five and eighty-six.And during this year I was teaching calculus and I was busy with things, there are,you know, colleagues come in and they want you to be
on committees. And finally, um,my final grades were submitted in May nineteen eighty-six and I started thinking about thisproblem again, first when I was on the east
coast for a while,going to Europe on and I found myself
in Paris. And finally I found myselfat an empty desk and on the Max Planck
Institute in Bonnwhere I can just sit and think and I
thought about thisyet again - BH: Is that what you do? Do you just sit at a desk with your head and your hands, andthink, think, think, I mean - what if I was a fly on the
wallwhen you were trying to crack this problem. What would I have seen? What was it looked like?Well, it's probably not have probably had
a pad of paper in front of me and apencilor a pen we didn't really have computers
quite yet although they were starting to come,and when you visit some institute you
don't have all your stuff with you don'thave lots of books you don't have all your
paraphernalia. So I was really just kindof sitting therelike that, and I started writing, you know.
And I-If you look in my office you'll find
lots of old pads where I sit and write,and, you know, a page might start what do we
know what are we trying to dosummarize the situation so far. "Let's-
 let's try this",and to my astonishment,I was finally able to-to cracked that problem - the simplest case of that epsilon.BH: It's like inspiration
comes at preordained times.
Like you sit down and say, okayfor the next two hours before I make my friend Bob a hot dog,I'm gonna have an inspiration and trying to solve the problem, and that's when it happens. It doesn'thappen on time, so you're lying on bed- 
Oh it can, I mean, if you
if you think about something veryintensively then you can just carry
around with youand you know lots of my colleagues say
that while they're swimminghad some insight or you know lots of
people say in the middle of the nightthey jumped up and they said my god you
know why don't I try a minus sign instead ofinstead of a plus signand this- this can indeed happen,
you know.BH: Not for you though. You are an at-the-desk kind of guy?I-I think in this particular situation I
was at the deskI knew for the first time thatI could do something that I hadn't done beforethat no one had done before. This is a
special case is this so-calledepsilon, And I kinda wrote and rewrote it just to make sure I was really right.And finally, using a very first
Macintosh that I had access toI typed out a letter to Barry Mazur at Harvard,and I sent him this letter explaining what I had done.And then I spent weeks and weeks trying to dothe general case. I couldn't see what to do and then fortunately,there was an international congress of
mathematicians.They occur once every four years on the campusof UC Berkeley. So I was right here.
I came back in Augustfor this International Congress and Barry Mazur was there.And on I spoke to him,and I said Barry I sent you this letter
explaining how I did a special case, andI really wonder, you know, what I
have to do now in the general case.And he looked at me completely quizzically.
He said: "Well, you've already done thegeneral case."and basically, he-when he read my letter to seemed obvious to him that there was this extra little thingyou carry alone as a supplemental
object. And this extra thing which isdo the bookkeeping. And,so we sat down at this Caffe Strada
which is at the corner of theBerkeley campus, and we had a Cappuccino and hekinda said well you just carry this and run with youand I was astonished you know it's like thisamazing moment were all the sudden I realizedthat in principle at least there was
no obstacle to proving thisepsilon conjecture. I mean, it like, you
know, my god, you know, it's somespecial thing, you know, an angel comes down
 and the light shines from the heavensor something. So this was really quite a thingand on since or my colleagueswere walking around the campus in this
big international congress Ikind of told, you know, a number of them
thatI have done this thing. You know of course
in beginning I was cautious I said wellI think I've done this thing, and- but
people keptrunning up to me. They said was it really
true you've done epsilon? Ilived in a world and think I still do
weremy colleagues are very generous with
attributions and praise and there isn'ttoo much of this kinda race to be the
first to publish andpeople basically- I had little fear that
someone would try to scoop meon the other hand what was a little
worrisomewas that I hadn't written down all the
details, you know, so I kinda written downvery closely the special case. ButI hadn't kind of worried about writing
thing more generallyso what happened was that during the
yearfollowing that, nineteen 86-87there was a special program on algebraic
geometry and arithmetic geometryat the Mathematical Sciences Research
Institute in Berkeley,the MSRI. So I was up there with my callings
andI gave lectures every week I gave
another lecture I was kinda giving likea min course onmy proof andwhen I wasn't lecturing I was furiously
typinginto the computer to try to expand and
revisemy manuscript in kinda more and more
details got put in.There were certainly people in the
audience who were appropriatelyskeptical. They asked me hard questions and I
didn't always know the answer to ourquestions you knowlike "How do we really know that this
thing is insuch-and-such way", and I would say well
you know this was proved in the1960s by Grothendieck but itisn't quite written down in the place you
expectthen I have find the argument. Well epsilon is small. It was clearly a misnomer.And let me just get up and pull off areprint. Here's my article. It was published
in 1990which really makesare a lot of time between 1986 and 1990.BH: How many pages?  It's like a book. Well it's amore than a pamphlet. If you
open up this paperon the very first or second page there'sFermat's equation and an elliptic curvebut then they disappear. If you look at
the actualarticle it's more about the
technicalities of the subject. It was abig deal in mathematics. It gotwrite ups in the press,
including Science magazineif I'm not mistaken.You know, whenever there's a serious
announcement,of a major theorem that gets a lot of
attention. Andpeople stop what they're doing to try to
seewhat the basis of proof is.BH: who called this Ribet Theorem?you know obviously it to make that name
that is above allother whenever addition both well theyeah that's right so you certainly there
there's a generalaversion to naming things after yourself
very often peoplegive lectures and I'll say such-and-such
the room and princes the right name thepersonwho on proves it and if it's a fair
amount they prove themselvesin typically right there the first
initial their last nameor something like that for all say they
don't onthey have no attribution listeners
understand all this is the fear that thepersonsis providing in this lecture. - You've done
this thingwhich is important if you have a bridge
between two things whichno other which also Granja. - Well that's
right so theum what what I when I showed was that
this modularityconjecture which was thought to be was
was felt to be truebut um wasn't expected to be provableI show that that thing actually implies
there was less thereI think the main takeaway from my
theorem wasthat since the very conjectureshort on the OMA was likely to be true
that now you should think that for mileslast year it was likely to be truefor example it probably wouldn't have
been a reallygood idea to spend a lot of computing
power looking for a counterexamplefarrell's less there well as anyone else
who's in the roomwell I was the whole thing so any Wells
you know coursingcame around a few times I guess but
basically he was holed up in his atticand I didn't know that and I think most
people didn't know thatso he was on I mean it's his I'mit's a statement that he was 
certainly intrigued by Fermat's last theoremas a child and then as soon as he heard
about thisRidge he decided to try to prove the
modularity theorembecause of its relation to the Fermat's last theorem.so was it is a sort of the situation that Andrew Wileswanted to prove Fermat's last theorem by any means possible he given him the meansthat's what he says I mean if this is
surprising to me becausemodularity theorem by itself is a
tremendous priceand you know it seems kind of strange
that you neededthe motivation to Fermats to go and
try to prove it if you thought thatthere was some wayside well anyway that's that's that's
that's what he saysyet we were all together meaning kinda
lots of people in the subject in aconference in Cambridge Englandin June 1993 and usually go to a
conference and you see the list speakersand you know you speaker has an hourand the thing and then set up so that
Andrew Wiles had three hoursI'm so here's the organizers he said I
have something I want to discuss it willtake me three hours and I like those
slotsI said okay from and thenin the first lecture you could see he
was provingHe was trying to prove the modularity
of some class elliptic curves butthe class elliptic curves at least in
the first lecture hadno intersection with the class that you
needed for Fermat's last theoremwithin the second lecture got a lot
closer andit became more and more parents have
people at the conferencethird lecture he was going to be able to
do enoughto get fair was last year the crowd was
growing so love the mathematiciansyou know brought their colleagues who
happen to be in Cambridge inyou know some other family members andI think there was a little doubt that he
would announce approval for was leftthere I'm so Ican i sat in the front row center and
brought my camera and snap the picture of himI wasn't another moment when you know
those cuts time stopand when I first realized what was going
to happen ..and then you know when it actually did
happen there was this somefrends of activity I mean the directorlove of the Isaac Newton Institutewhere these lectures were held onhad ordered a case a Napa Valley brute
champagnefor the end the lecture is after the
lecture we came out into theyou know common area only is all the
champagne flutes wereproduced in his bottle started poppingyou know this is kinda really an amazing
thing between that time when you-originally published a paper and this
lecture it was a cold or write you anasty lol nah to worknot a word you know it i no idea what he
was doingon you he whole who absolutelyhe was so he was a a friend and a
colleague I first met him when he was agraduate student in Cambridgeand in fact when I first came to
berkeley the first year that I was herehe was one of the first people that I
invited came to spend a week and gave alecture toon do you that delight he kept a secret
that make a surprise Ito this day you battle by I'm using a
little collegiateyou're telling me when you thought you
open your running around tellingeveryoneNEC said well it's very unusual behaviorand the you know you can say in
retrospect that it was reallyum justified because he was afraid that
people would kind of jump all over itbecause %uh the important sothe modularity conjecture and fair I was
last thereon button he did not ontell me what he was doing he did fromconfide in to this calling to princeton
as he was givingis graduate course where he was working
out the ideasthat on were instrumental in this paper
I think it was only a few days laterthat I got a copy of this manuscriptand the manuscript was very thicknose like 300 pages fromsingle space you know typeset bytest mathematics typesetting program andon we were supposed tobe the referee is onlooking at different parts of the paper
and I was assigned to a parthat be turn out to be problem-free armand I'm the cats look at a park butturn out to have problems a problem was
there shatteringfor you a do you like that doesn't make
you think this is goodI like the reader a lot about it really
deflating up to I havechampagne mean finding the problem wellfrom want more of the aspects of the
whole thing is that I had gone outpretty for a limbfrom telling everybody that Andrew Wiles
improve this thingon in the way that started was thatwhen the New York Times first heard
about his announcement may ask to speakto him and returns me and saidand you know you speak to Gina Kolata so
I wentand on went upstairs andspoke to her for a very long time
explaining the whole thingand then I'm somehow the media kept
calling mebecause it was understood from that
somehow I was is designated spokespersonso I nice spent the entire summerI'm lecturing about his theoremandI'm fielding phone calls from I'm the
presshello for was announcement castoh I think it was like two weeks what
happens in mathematics is if if you havea proof that seems to really beon seems to have a lot orfrom internal logicto it and there's something that's wrong
with the proofyour immediate reaction is to say wellyou know this is just some technical
problem that I need to fixand I think that are Andrew Wiles when
hefound out about the gap arm expected
that you would be able to repair insuredorso it really took a while before there
was somerealization on his part that this was a
serious problemcouldn't be fixed on immediately just by
theirtools improper if you love the person
who was taking all the calls from thepresswhatever reason did that mean you will
you are contactingand while get updates on the game
because my i don't know what to tellthem whatwe call him but those you want to say it
was ahe gone right not especially Inc he kind
of went darkhe was working on on mathematics andI wasn't wasn't getting a lot of
information out of him at that timeyou know it was all poison about right i
meanI'm wasn't clear whether or not this
will get repaired or notand then you know wonderfully it turned
out that there wasthis so repair to the prooffrom release in completely new insight
actually by Andrew Wiles and RichardTaylorwho work together over the summer and
this will be the summer1994 and theyhad a or preprint outin in the fall 1994 really explain their
new method in which is nowcall Taylor Wiles method and thatreally I'm circumvented a lot or the
more complicated arguments in theoriginalpreprint and the two articles were
published togetheron the following summer which is a
summer 1995 in the annals of mathematicsit was a relief but it was it was not
ourkinda joyous relief you know and Richard
Taylor came to me one dayagain MSRI where I happen to be infall far 1994 any sandwe have some good news for you and thenon the next day and make up in this
paper so that was kinda very goodand you know I don't remember there
beinga huge celebration on the momentthe releases that reprint been just
kinda gradually build people understandthat the proof is completeand then there was a very large
instructional conference at BostonUniversity in summer1995 different people got up and explain
the differentelements approve well it was a fabulous
pieces mathematicsarm as impressed arm with bywhat what I did and presses I am by my
my own were comingI'm even much more impressed by what
they didon they had some really knew inside andthis inside has I'm percolated throughour whole subject for the last twenty
years armone way to say what they did is they
showedthat somehow modularity is contagiousin the sense that if you have something
that hope has a little pieces that themodularyou can parlay that into modularity over
forty first evolved Wiles wasobviously intensely driven to do this he
wasreally motivated and he said you know
I'm gonna do this one way or anotherand me brought in all sorts adifferent techniques that hadn't been
relatedon to the the problem beforeon what some what's amazing for example
there's a whole subject an algebraicgeometry call deformation theorythat was going on when I was a graduate
student that I didn't learnI thought that was really far removed
from anything involvingelliptic curves and on inthe years before wells announcement
Harry Mazerhad developed this new technique of
deformation theory in gallerypresentations and it turned out to be
exactly whatWiles needed the language in the
techniques the medianfor his discussion on and soyou know something that seems to be far
away technically turn out to be crucialwell I think I'm you know just
informally everyone refer to it as theFermat's last theorembut in fact when you when you look at
the article just like my article wassomething internal toon series modular forms and get our
presentations and Wiles article in myarticle sharethe trait that for was a question covers
exactly once in the article in thebeginningand then you get down to the real stuff
on very happy with therecognition that I've gotten and Ivery proud of what I did and be Iwhen students come and my classes they
may know about myrole for Fermat's last theorem. A lot of them have seen thevideo that was broadcast on over and BBCand a I think you know if you do
something very very very very famous andyou have an encore problemwhere people saying you know what great
thing you're going to do nextand I try to be on more or less a normal
guyandnot you know walk around with angels on
your shoulderbritt to rediscover what FAMAS proof
might it beis that they have widely-helds that he
had done it already disclaim lotwas he telling the truth ? I think by the
time we get to 20th century it's quiteclearthat this is an incredibly complex problem.
