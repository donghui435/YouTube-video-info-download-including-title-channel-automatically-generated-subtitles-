An investment firm
creates a graphshowing the performance of a
specific stock over 12 months.Over the course of
the year, is the priceof the stock rising,
falling, or staying the same?So over this axis right over
here, the horizontal axis,they have month by month.And we move forward in time--
July, August, September,October.And in this axis, the vertical
axis, we have the price.So, for example, in July
the price of this stockwas a little over $10.Then in August, it moved up
to-- it looks like around $11.And then we could keep
going month by month.And this type of
graph right over hereis called a line
graph because youhave the data points
for each month.And then we connected
them with a line.And the reason why we
connect them with a lineis to really see if there's
some kind of a trendhere to really show that
you have something that'smoving from one
price to another.And so line graphs
tend to be usedwhen you have something
that's changing over time.Now, with that out of
the way, let's actuallyanswer their question.Over the course of
the year, is the priceof the stock rising,
falling, or staying the same?So on a month-to-month
basis, you have, for example,from July to August,
the price went up.Then from August to September,
the price went down.Then it went up for two months.Then it went down for a month.Then it went up for
a couple more months.Then it went really up
from February to March,went all the way
up to almost $17.Then it went down again.And then it kept going up again.But they're asking us not
did it go up every month.They're saying over
the course of the yearis the price of the
stock rising, falling,or staying the same?And if you go from July, which
is where our data starts rightover here, our price
was around $10.And even though there were a
few months where it went down,the overall trend is that
the price is going up.The overall trend is
that the price going up.And you can even see that.In July, it was $10.And then by June
of the next year,it was approaching--
I don't know,it looks like it's
about a littleover $16, maybe almost $17.So it actually
had gone up a lot.They don't give us
July of the next year.But the overall
trend is definitelythe upwards direction
right over here.And you can see it just visually
by looking at this line graph.Even though there's a
few bumps that go down,the overall direction is upward.
