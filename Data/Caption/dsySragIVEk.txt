in this video we're going to take a lookat the natural base E and naturallogarithms which we see on ourcalculators often as Ln now let me startthere because that's often a questionwhy is natural logarithm written Lengine to be NL well it turns out thatnatural logarithm comes from the latinname the Ln which is logarithmic Naturalie so there's our Ln so that's whynatural logarithms are Ln rather than NLwhen we're working with the natural baseand natural logarithms we need toremember that all the rules oflogarithms apply so the natural isreally just a special case and it issimply just the log with the base of ethat's our natural logarithm so it's thelog with the base of e and E and thenatural logarithm of e are just inversesso some specific properties that we seethere one if we have the naturallogarithm oops and what I wrote that Hfor if we have the natural logarithm andthat's of e to the X power that's justgoing to simplify to X because these twothings are inverses of each other in thesame way if I have e to the natural logof X power that's going to simplify tojust X so those two things are inversesand I'm going to use that fact alongwith the fact that I can take if I havea logarithm and that number has a powerso let's say I have something like thisI have the log base B of A to appiypower that's equal to I can pull that Pout front so I have P times the logbase B of A and I can do vice-versa sothere's going to be times when I mightwant to take that number that's beingmultiplied there and pull it back intothe exponent and there's also times whenI want to take the exponent and pull itout front so I'm going to use all thosedifferent properties in order tosimplify and look at these in which casewe have the natural base E and naturallogarithms interacting so for this firstone up here as I look at it I have thelog of e to the 7x okay well if Iremember natural logarithms and thatpower I could pull that power out fronthere and I would have 7x times thenatural log of e well the natural logremember that and I'm writing out moresteps than I definitely need here butjust to be very clear off how this thisgoes on remember that the natural log islog base E and then of e well rememberthis really means e to what power givesme e well that would be e to the firstpower so this piece right here is just 1and 1 times 7x is just going to give me7x so we see how those two things undoeach other and I'm left with just the 7xwhich was in the exponent let's take alook at this one right here in this casewe have a 3 times this stuff up here inthe exponent and the the E and thenatural log aren't going to undo eachother at this point yet we need to getthat 3 out of there and in this casewhat we can do using this property righthere except that often we pull thatexponent down in this case we're goingto take that number that's beingmultiplied push it back up to anexponent so this is going to be e timesour e to the natural logof X to the third powernow that e in that natural log they'reinverses so they go away and I'm leftwith just X to the third all right let'stake a look at this next one over herewhere we have the natural log of e tothe X minus one power again I could gothrough all these steps to be clear butwe know that those are inverses so I'mgoing to be left with just X minus onedown here I have the natural log of xtimes natural log of e to the thirdpower well in this case what I could dois take that 3 and pull it up frontbecause again my natural log and my ear'inverses so I'm going to take that 3 andpull it in front of there so it's goingto be x times 3 times natural log of ewell that's just 1so x times 3 times 1 is just 3x andfinally this last one over here we have2 times the natural log of e to the Xagain I can take that X pull it down infront of that and have 2 times x timesthe natural log of e that stuff just 1so 2 times x times 1 is just 2x allright so working with natural base E andnatural logarithms remember it's just aspecial case of logarithms where we haveit's the log with the base e that's ournatural logarithm and that base eremember that's the two-point-sevenba-ba-ba-ba number so inverses we canuse all the properties of logarithms weknow that they undo each other so righthere we saw that we just end up with xin those two cases and also the power wecan pull it back down to the front or wecan push it back up to be an exponentagain I hope this video was helpful andremember it's Ln because of the latinname logarithmic netshall I work hard on your math and Iknow you'll do great
