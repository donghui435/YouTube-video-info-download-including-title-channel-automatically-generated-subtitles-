g'day welcome to Tech math Channel whatwe're going to be having a look at inthis video is the counting principle andthis is a way of counting up our variouscombinations really really quickly sothis is the start of a series of videoswhere we're going to be looking atcombinations and permutations which ispretty much a nice mathematical way ofsaying working at the number ofdifferent ways that things can bearranged for instance are how manydifferent ways how many differentcombinations could you have in acombination lock or how many differentways could lotto numbers come out orthis one for instance say I had fourbooks and one two three four books and Iwas thinking to myself oh how manydifferent ways could I arrange these onthe bookshelf so instant food since Icould put them in this order that blueblack red or green or I can put themblue black green or red or I might getthe red one first then the black one andthen the green one and then the blue oneand you might then think to yourselfwell how many different combinationsbecause you have and this is what thiscombinations and permutations start tolook at and more specifically today thisis what this counting principle will belooking at okay and we're going to beusing this in some later parts of whatwe're going to be doing so we're goingto explain this by going through anexample and we just start by imaginingI'm choosing my outfit for the dayso anyway I look in the cupboard and thefirst thing I look down at is my shoesand I'm trying to decide what shoes Ihave to wear I have black shoes and Ihave blue shoes okay and then the nextthing I'm going to decide is what colorpants I'm gonna wear for that day andbecause I'm a funky sort of guy I havegreen pants and I also have orange pantsand then the next thing on the side iswhat shirt I'm going to wear okay so Ithink to myself I have a red shirt Ihave a blue shirt and I also have ablack shirt and so how many differentcombinations of outfits how manydifferent combinations of clothescan I wear out of these shoes pants andshirt combinations could I make out ofthatso this is where we use this countingprinciple to work out but first off whatwe're going to do is we're gonna draw upa tree diagram now a tree diagram prettymuch lists up all the differentcombinations that are possible so welook at all the different decisions thatwe make so the first decision we make iswhat shoes I'm going to wearnow we could either choose that I'd bewearing black or ugly wearing blue so wehave a different branch goes off to eachof those the next thing we decide iswhat color pants though so for each ofthese I might then decide I'm going towear either green so this one I couldeither wear black and then black shoesthen green pants or blue shoes and thengreen pants or I could use wear orangepants with either of these decisions thethird thing I then do is look at shirtsI could wear three different colorshirts for all of these yeah so I couldwear a red shirt okay or I could wearyou guessed it blue or I could wearblack and so what this tree diagram doesexactly stuff all the combinations andwhat you'll see is if you can the endsof the branches here you see how manydifferent combinations we have we have 12 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 combinations 12different combinations of outfits Icould wear you thinking to yourself orthat's that's pretty handy dandy and youlook pretty funky of you are very wherevarious ones but you might think isthere a faster way of doing that withoutdrawing out this tea tree diagram andthere is and I'm going to show you howto do that because I have two pairs ofshoes two pairs of pants and threeshirts and they're very simple way ofdoing that is if I just multiply thesethrough two times 2 is 4 times 3 equals12 so say for instance I are verydisciplined all of a sudden now I have 6pairs of shoes I have seven pairs ofpants and I'll have 12 pairs of shirtsto choose from how would I go aboutRiley drawing one of those trade ideaswhich would take ages and to be honestabout to be rather squishy you're notvery fun to draw how would I go aboutdoing this well I just multiply thisthrough so how many different outfitthat I have 6 times 7 times 12 okay sothat multiplied together mate I have 502different combinations of clothing Icould wear okay so that's a reallyreally easy way of doing this and Icould write out a rule for that but Ithink you really probably just get thatthe you just get your number ofdifferent combinations and then youmultiply so what about you try some sowhat about we have a menu okay you go torestaurant we have a menu and on thismenu we have entrees and there are fourof these and then after the entrees youhave the mains and on the main coursethere are ten different main coursedishes and then on the desserts we havetwo three different types of dessertsand I can ask you then how manydifferent three-course dinnercombinations could you make off this soI'll get you to work it out I reckon youneed probably I reckon you should havealready worked it out because I knowyou're all great at multiplying and Ithink what you do is you go 4 times 10is 40 times 3 ok that's going to be 120different combinations okay a bit of aharder example now so say we have alotto where we have six numbers so sixnumbers and I'll draw them here one twothree four five six numbers and they getchosen from one your balls numbered fromone to 45 okay and now I want to know ishow many different combinations that wehave here so this is a bit of a harderone and the way that we do this is asfollows so I've got the slots here andthis is a really good thing to driver tostart the six different balls we'rechoosing I've drawn six different slotsso there's gonna be six different thingswe're multiplying so the first slot herethe first ball we choose out okay wehave 45 bold 145 you might think this upfour of the first ball we choose out wehave 45 possibilities anywhere from 1 to45 that we choose for the second Bowl wechoose out how many possibilities do wehave for one of these balls has beenchosen out there so we only have 44balls left so they'll be 44 differentpossibilities okay what about the nextone we'll have 43 possibilities 42possibilities and next one had 41possibility because the balls gone andthen because that balls going on thenext one we have 40 possibilities so howmany different combinations do we haveand so you might look at this and thinkokay okay how we work that out we'regoing to multiply that's a lot ofnumbers to multiply we have the numberof five billion 864 million four hundredand forty three thousand two hundredcombinations so one other one and thisone is a bit more where I come from Icome from Victoria in Australia we havewell up until very recently we used tohave license plates that were like thiswe would have three letters say a letterletter letter and it was followed bythree numbers and I've been to differentplaces around the world and I've seenthat everyone has different types of ourlicense plates so this is the ones wayhome you could work this one out foryour own license place where you're fromso I want to know how many differentcombinations we have that we could haveyou I mean obviously it's going to beaffected a bit now they don't like tohave rude words and that sort of deal onlicense plates but we're not going totake that into a consideration you knowwe're not going to have P oo hoo oranything like that so how many differentcombinations license plates could wehave so you might think to yourself okaythe first one they could choose anyletter it's 26 letters in the alphabetso there's 26 possibilities for thatfirst letter and then the next onethey could choose once again any letterbecause there's still 26 letters you canhave a and then you can have another aso we're not worried about repeats hereand then the next one you could alsochoose 26 letters and the 26 lettersnow numbers we have 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9that's 10 different possibilities 10different and 10 different for the nextones so how do we work out how do wecount up all these combinations reallyquicklywe multiply through so 26 times 26 times26 times 10 times 10 times 10 and theanswer to this is there is 17 millionfive hundred and seventy six thousandcombinations so you could work that outon a license plate where you're fromokay and however they work them outbecause they do vary but I'm just goingto finish with one last thing on thiswhich is this idea to say what about arewe worried about a license plate wherewe couldn't repeat any letters ornumbers okay every letter and numberheck be unique how would you work thatout differently it's not a huge thing todobecause of the first number of lettersthat came out you would have 26 now sayit was any number of those letters thatyou took out it would only leave 25letters for the next possibility and thenext one because now you've got the ridof these two would only leave 24possibilities okay so for the numbers wehave 10 to start off with and youguessed it the next one we would onlyhave 9 the next time we'd only have 8and to work out the number ofcombinations even though repeats wereavailable so would be to send a multiplythere and so you see that slightvariance here and that takes it downfrom 17 billion to 11 million 232,000combinations anyway hopefully you foundthis video informativeum it's fairly intuitive I find a lot ofthis stuff but it will get a little bitharder when we start to get into theharder combinations and permutations andI'm sure some people are going to comeout with some really gnarly sort of uhcomments and questions so anyway I hopeyou found that good see you next timebye
