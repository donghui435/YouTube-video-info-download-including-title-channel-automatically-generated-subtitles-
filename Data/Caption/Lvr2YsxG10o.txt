We're asked to shade 20%
of the square below.Before doing that, let's
just even think aboutwhat percent means.Let me just rewrite it.20% is equal to-- I'm just
writing it out as a word-- 20percent, which literally
means 20 per cent.And if you're familiar with the
word century, you mightalready know that cent
comes from the Latinfor the word hundred.This literally means you
can take cent, and thatliterally means 100.So this is the same thing
as 20 per 100.If you want to shade 20%, that
means, if you break up thesquare into 100 pieces, we
want to shade 20 of them.20 per 100.So how many squares have
they drawn here?So if we go horizontally right
here, we have one, two, three,four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten squares.If we go vertically, we have
one, two, three, four, five,six, seven, eight, nine, ten.So this is a 10 by 10 square.So it has 100 squares here.Another way to say it is that
this larger square-- I guessthat's the square that they're
talking about.This larger square is a broken
up into 100 smaller squares,so it's already broken
up into the 100.So if we want to shade 20% of
that, we need to shade 20 ofevery 100 squares that
it is broken into.So with this, we'll just
literally shade in 20 squares.So let me just do one.So if I just do one square, just
like that, I have justshaded 1 per 100
of the squares.100 out of 100 would
be the whole.I've shaded one of them.That one square by itself
would be 1%of the entire square.If I were to shade another one,
if I were to shade thatand that, then those two
combined, that's 2% of theentire square.It's literally 2 per 100,
where 100 wouldbe the entire square.If we wanted to do 20, we do
one, two, three, four-- if weshade this entire row, that
will be 10%, right?One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.And we want to do 20, so that'll
be one more row.So I can shade in this whole
other row right here.And then I would have shaded
in 20 of the 100 squares.Or another way of thinking about
it, if you take thislarger square, divide it into
100 equal pieces, I've shadedin 20 per 100, or 20%, of the
entire larger square.Hopefully, that makes sense.
