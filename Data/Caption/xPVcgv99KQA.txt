all right here's 276 divided by 12equals 23 yet again here's the explodingdots way I like to do it to the pictureand I can see what's going on I foundthe picture 236 lots of groups of 12 1 X2 2 dots say we saw one at the tenslevel another one of the tens level andwe saw three at the ones level theanswer is 23 groups of 12 in thispicture of 276 great but that's not whatI was taught when I went to school but Iwant to do now is show you the algorithmI was taught as a youngster back inAustralia in the 1970s it was somewhatstrange I was actually very veryconfused by it I did not understand whyit worked the way it did so wonderingnow actually goes through that algorithmI'll share with you what I was taughtback 40 years ago and let's see if wecan make some sense of it once and forallthe young James Canton all right heregoes so 276 divided by 12 so back inAustralia where to draw a funny symbolbeginning with a draw funny curve shapefor the bow on top all rightI know some countries do it differentlythey might write 26 : 12 but we drawthis symbol and write the big number 276under it and the 12 to the left of itall right nowhumility how everything in math class isright to left right to left right flipis always right to left so I thought wasstrange of the kid because I was beingtaught to read left to right in everyother class except mathematics howeverlook at this back in Australia is sunnytold no no you do this left to rightokay they just switch direction on mebut I thought was strangenow you look at the two first two aboutbetween 36 but don't think 276apparently you think - you ask how manytimes the twelve go into two anythingmay be silly okay so then you go allright to go to total Georgia - but go toseven look at the first digit two digitsand think of that as 27 now I thoughtthat was weird because the number is not27 as 276 however I did rise told andsaid okay 12 into 27 how many times the12 going to 27 what goes in twice and wecould write that 2 at the top and as akid I got really nervous because how dothe alignment matter where you write thenumber but we had to write it up thereare three goes in the middle column if Iremember correctly then back inAustralia 40 years ago we they hadactually write 2 times 12 is 24 okayand then we had suddenly just dosubtraction problem why not27 take a 24 is 3 I had no idea of theyoungster where that was coming from okpretty bizarre but that was not thebizarrest part of all then we have the 3down here we start this 6 up here wehaven't dealt with yetwe're told back in Australia just drawan arrow bring that 6 down and make that3 just change to 36 it just magicallychanges that is awfully weird excuse menow welcome 36 another why just doingwhat I was taughtHemet eyes of 12 go to 36 apparentlygoes into 3 times throughout the threeat the top right 3 times 12 is 36through another subtraction problems whynot and then you get 0 and parodieszeroes is good all right now I'm being alittle bit flippant here but it is trueI did not understand this algorithm whenI was 10 years old living is all have alot old I was I just do it I wasactually performing for my class andgetting the right answers more or lessbut I did not understand what I wasdoing so I want to say figure out what'sreally going on here because of coursethis is a good correct technique there'snothing wrong with this of coursethey're teaching good sound things inschool the question is how can I makeactual perfect sense of it for my sakeall right so I'm going to compare thestandard algorithm with what I feel Itruly understand this picture so thanksto the algorithm look at the two you'reasking how he tries the twelve go intotwo I guess what I really doing when Isay look at that - what am I reallylooking at there must be this two herethese two dots and you're asking to seeany twelves in those two dots well no sodon't be silly then we said to go tosevennow we've told a thing about 27 which Idon't think is quite right it's notreally 27 because it really is just twodots and these seven dots of any I'mputting my hand out his post paperssaying look at that perfect over thelist of two boxes two dots and sevendots okay only 12 to merge those twodots and seven dots why yes we foundwhat's under that we found two groups ofthem they even worked two groups themlike thiswell the alignments it was saying allright so down to two groups of 12 muchthese two dots and seven dots now thequestion is what's the subtractionbusiness about what are we really doingthere what we're saying okay we've dealtwith those two dots those two groups of12 so I'm also get rid of them we don'tneed to do them anymore we've got themsorted outand that leaves three dots left behindwe have to contend with three dots leftbehind where to contend with now thepilot I found really confusing as a kidwas bringing the six down the threethese three dots here has magicallychanged to 36 well the language is alittle bit off there I do say thatbecause I'm not really saying changes at36 I'm saying we moved my hand and I'llfocus on the three dots and the six dotsthree dots and six volts next togethergrant now ask any groups of 12 and theirwhy yes three pounds three of them wewrote three row three we did no thesubtraction problem is to show therewere no dots back behind that means wecompleted a division problem and there'sno remainders so actually this is a verygood approach it works brilliantly infact if you get tired of drawing dotsand boxes I'm using a lot of ink there'sa good pencil paper method for doing itthough I would say I bet if you did alot of division problems by drawingthese dots and boxes you probably gettired of drawing dots you must justmight just write the numbers two sevensix might just do thatyou probably might only bother drawingthe box anymore just like might writethe numbers 276 you might find yourselfdoing something like this or theshorthand for this image we have in mindas I bet whoever created this methodmany many centuries ago was actuallyworking with pictures begin with andthis all became a shorthand for thepictures so I say there's no harm ingoing back to the pictures and justdoing it that way or if you like theshorthand method on pencil papers moreabstract good - all goodcorrect mathematics is fabulously goodand fabulously correct nothing goeswrong this is a matter your own personalstyle and choice so what do you likebest is good go for it
