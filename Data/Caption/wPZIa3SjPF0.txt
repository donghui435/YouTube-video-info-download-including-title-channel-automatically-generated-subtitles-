What is the type of
this quadrilateral?Be as specific as possible
with the given data.So it clearly is
a quadrilateral.We have four sides here.And we see that we have two
pairs of parallel sides.Or we could also say there are
two pairs of congruent sideshere as well.This side is parallel and
congruent to this side.This side is parallel and
congruent to that side.So we're dealing
with a parallelogram.Let's do more of these.So here it looks like
a same type of scenariowe just saw in the last one.We have two pairs of
parallel and congruent sides,but all the sides aren't
equal to each other.If they're all
equal to each other,we'd be dealing with a rhombus.But here, they're not
all equal to each other.This side is congruent
to the side opposite.This side is congruent
to the side opposite.That's another parallelogram.Now this is interesting.We have two pairs of sides that
are parallel to each other,but now all the sides
have an equal length.So this would be
a parallelogram.And it is a
parallelogram, but they'resaying to be as specific as
possible with the given data.So saying it's a
rhombus would bemore specific than saying
it's a parallelogram.This does satisfy
the constraintsfor being a parallelogram,
but saying it's a rhombustells us even more.Not every parallelogram
is a rhombus,but every rhombus
is a parallelogram.Here, they have the sides are
parallel to the side oppositeand all of the sides are equal.Let's do a few more of these.What is the type of
this quadrilateral?Be as specific as possible
with the given data .So we have two pairs of
sides that are parallel,or I should say one pair.We have a pair of sides
that are parallel.And then we have another
pair of sides that are not.So this is a trapezoid.But then they have
two choices here.They have trapezoid and
isosceles trapezoid.Now an isosceles
trapezoid is a trapezoidwhere the two non-parallel
sides have the same length, justlike an isosceles
triangle, you havetwo sides have the same length.Well we could see these two
non-parallel sides do nothave the same length.So this is not an
isosceles trapezoid.If they did have the
same length, thenwe would pick that
because that wouldbe more specific
than just trapezoid.But this case right over here,
this is just a trapezoid.Let's do one more of these.What is the type of
this quadrilateral?Well we could say
it's a parallelogrambecause all of the
sides are parallel.But if we wanted to
be more specific,you could also see that
all the sides are the same.So you could say it's
a rhombus, but youcould get even more
specific than that.You notice that
all the sides areintersecting at right angles.So this is-- if we wanted to be
as specific as possible-- thisis a square.Let me check the answer.Got it right.
