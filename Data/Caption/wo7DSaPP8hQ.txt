We're told that for the past
few months, Old Maple Farmshas grown about 1,000 more
apples than their chief rivalin the region, River Orchards.Due to cold weather this year,
the harvests at both farmswere down by about a third.However, both farms made up for
some of the shortfall bypurchasing equal quantities
of apples from farms inneighboring states.What can you say about
the number of applesavailable at each farm?Does one farm have more than the
other, or do they have thesame amount?How do I know?So let's define some
variables here.Let's let M be equal to number
of apples at Maple Farms. Andthen who's the other guy?River Orchards.So let's let R be equal
to the number ofapples at River Orchards.So this first sentence, they
say-- let me do this in adifferent color-- they say for
the past few years, Old MapleFarms has grown about 1,000 more
apples than their chiefrival in the region,
River Orchards.So we could say, hey, Maple is
approximately Old River, or Mis approximately River
plus 1,000.Or since we don't know the exact
amount-- it says it'sabout 1,000 more, so we don't
know it's exactly 1,000 more--we can just say that in a normal
year, Old Maple Farms,which we denote by M, has a
larger amount of apples thanRiver Orchard.So in a normal year, M is
greater than R, right?It has about 1,000 more apples
than Old Maple Farms.Now, they say due to cold
weather this year-- so let'stalk about this year now-- the
harvests at both farms weredown about a third.So this isn't a normal year.Let's talk about what's going
to happen this year.In this year, each of these
characters are going to bedown by 1/3.Now if I go down by 1/3, that's
the same thing as being2/3 of what I was before.Let me do an example.If I'm at x, and I take away
1/3x, I'm left with 2/3x.So going down by 1/3 is the same
thing as multiplying thequantity by 2/3.So if we multiply each of these
quantities by 2/3, wecan still hold this inequality,
because we'redoing the same thing to both
sides of this inequality, andwe're multiplying by
a positive number.If we were multiplying by a
negative number, we would haveto swap the inequality.So we can multiply both
sides of this by 2/3.So 2/3 of M is still going to
be greater than 2/3 of R.And you could even draw that in
a number line if you like.Let's do this in
a number line.This all might be a little
intuitive for you, and if itis, I apologize, but if it's
not, it never hurts.So that's 0 on our
number line.So in a normal year, M is
has 1,000 more than R.So in a normal year, M might
be over here andmaybe R is over here.I don't know, let's say
R is over there.Now, if we take 2/3 of M, that's
going to stick us someplace around, oh, I
don't know, 2/3is right about there.So this is M-- let me write
this-- this is 2/3 M.And what's 2/3 of
R going to be?Well, if you take 2/3 of this,
you get to right about there,that is 2/3R.So you can see, 2/3R is still
less than 2/3M, or 2/3M isgreater than 2/3R.Now, they say both farms made
up for some of the shortfallby purchasing equal quantities
of apples from farms inneighboring states.So let's let a be equal
to the quantityof apples both purchased.So they're telling
us that they bothpurchased the same amount.So we could add a to both sides
of this equation and itwill not change the
inequality.As long as you add or subtract
the same value to both sides,it will not change
the inequality.So if you add a to both sides,
you have a plus 2/3M is agreater than 2/3R plus a.This is the amount that Old
Maple Farms has afterpurchasing the apples, and this
is the amount that RiverOrchards has.So after everything is said
and done, Old Maple Farmsstill has more apples, and
you can see that here.Maple Farms, a normal year, this
year they only had 2/3 ofthe production, but then they
purchased a apples.So let's say a is about, let's
say that a is that manyapples, so they got back
to their normal amount.So let's say they got back
to their normal amount.So that's how many apples
they purchased, sohe got back to M.Now, if R, if River Orchards
also purchased a apples, thatsame distance, a, if you go
along here gets you to rightabout over there.So once again, this is-- let
me do it a little bitdifferent, because I don't like
it overlapping, so let medo it like this.So let's say this guy, M-- I
keep forgetting their names--Old Maple Farms purchases a
apples, gets them that far.So that's a apples.But River Orchards also
purchases a apples, so let'sadd that same amount.I'm just going to copy and paste
it so it's the exactsame amount.So River Orchards also purchases
a, so it alsopurchases that same amount.So when all is said and done,
River Orchards is going tohave this many apples in the
year that they had lessproduction but they went
and purchased it.So this, right here, is--
this value right hereis 2/3R plus a.That's what River
Orchards has.And then Old Maple Farms has
this value right here, whichis 2/3M plus a.Everything said and done,
Old Maple Farmsstill has more apples.
