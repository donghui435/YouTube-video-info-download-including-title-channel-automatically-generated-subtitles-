welcome today let's talk about primenumbers in particular tasks can movethem out there now most people say thatwhen if I start to list the primes lookslike they go on forever and says thereany many numbers that were surprisedprobably grows on a new phone as wellthat's an intuitive thought and maybethat's absolutely correct but doeswarrant some proof some deep thinkinghere now the first person to really sortof clinch the idea that the primes do infact go on foreverwas given the answer way and was Euclid300 years BC which is astounding that'stwo thousand three hundred years agosomeone thought there was need toexamine this question and to reallyoffer proof to it I'm gonna go a littlebit further with this question not onlyask how many Prime's there are but I'vestarted listing here on the screen butask how many twin primes there are aswell and what do I mean by twin primethat means two consecutive odd numberswas the closest thing he bakes at thetwo or three that are both prime sincethree and five is a true pair of twinprimes 5 7 11 13 17 19 let's say 41 4359 61 the list of those go on foreverand in fact if you play around with itfor a while you'll finally get harderand harder to her to write out and findso you might start to question it andthen people naughty people sort of goone step further look if they're ifthey're twins of primes where tripletsthree consecutive odd numbers each ofwhich is prime example three five sevenis actually a triple of primes and Idon't think is another one on this listah okay so I read further maybe I findanother one but the question is the listof triples of primes also gone forevernow we're in new territory don't knowall right so let's find out where surebegin should begin with the triples orbegin with the singles let's see let'slet's let's go with you could let'squickly go through you kids proof thatthe list of primes the single Prime'sitselves actually does go on forever asproof was very clear very ingenious andyou noticed that every number other isprime or is composite or as they say inAmerica composite if you've got a numberlike 60 and it's not prime because itbreaks into factors it's actually 10times 6 and each of those factors is notPrime's about 10 is 2 times 5and 6 is 2 times 3 but eventually we dothis process he's notice that everynumber does break into primes 2 5 2 & 3in this case so in number it's not primewon't break number that does break intofactors is not this is going to breakinto prime factors eventually what I sayso use this idea to construct newPrime's for example suppose I thoughtthe numbers on the screen right now allthe primes that were he said okay greatthen multiply them all together 2 times3 times 5 times 7 times 11 times everyboard times 61 times 67 is a hugemonstrous number but then add one to itso let n be the product all the primes Ithink there are currently our fingersonly the ones up to 67 and then modelingtogether than add one well this numberit's certainly not even in fact it's twotimes something plus one at leastremainder 1 when divisible divided by 2so if I was to break this number twoprimes 2 will not be one of the factorsexample 2 as a factor 60 because 2 waseven nor will it be a multiple 3 becauseif this number is actually 3 times wholebunch of stuff Plus once upon divisionby 3 Lee's remainder of 1 supposed tobreak this huge number and into primesit will not have 3 is a prime 60 wasdoubles by 3 has 3 as one of its factorsthis number went broke into prime so Ihave 3 is one of his Prime's in all havea number 5 because this number is onemore than a multiple of 5 is notdivisible by 5nor is it divisible by 11 that thisnumber n is one more than a multiple of11 that n is also one more than multiple61 and one more than multiple 67 and onemore the mobile 37 that is one more thanevery prime well put a model of so onemore than any multiple of every primeI've got so far so this number nwhatever it is this has none of thefactors that has the prime factors Ithink so far so either n is prime itselfwhich case voilaI've discovered a brand new prime waybigger than any prime currently on mylist or it's not prime it'll break intoprimes which can't be any the primes Icurrently have so far so I'll create newplants from this that's it from any fileat list of primes you kids now given mea means to construct another set ofprimeadd to my list there gives me a new listto that list multiply them all togetheradd one and from that I can distract newprimes to add to my list brother a newlist take all those Prime's that brandnew list small Harmon together and addone and I can straighten even morePrime's at my listtherefore the list of primes goes onforever alright so the single Prime'sare indeed infinite in number now I needto point something out here this methoddoes not say that he's going to generatethe primes in order example let me takethe first few Prime's my list 2 3 & 5 :Euclid 2 times 3 times 5 I believe thatis 30 add 1 gives the number 31 whichhappens to be prime but it's not thenext number in my list so you couldnever guarantee you'll get the Prime'sin order for his method that he wasn'tshooting for that there's not a problemfor himhere's the thing that most peopleactually don't realize either if youplay this game 2 + 1 + equals 2 times 3+ 1 + equals 2 times 3 times 5 plus 1 itlooks like all the numbers you do createthis way are themselves directly Primeit's also not true in fact if you didthe first just 3 times 5 times 7 times11 times 13 that plus 1 is actuallystill prime but the first but if youcould burn all that to 17 in this casewhoops oh my language is not very goodhere and being called sloppy this thisone turns out to be not prime fact ifyou'd like you can actually write it outand see if you find the prime factors ofit but there you will actually see brandnew Prime's different from the primes upfrom to the 17 alright Italy many trip asingle primes let's go on to the nexteasiest case which is the triple ofprimes how many triples of primes arethere and if you're bored with my videothus far you may be drooling on the sidetrying to find the next triple of primesand I say to you good luck because thelist is finite and in fact it's so funout there's only one example of tripleof primesthis one there's myso three five seven is the only exampleof a triple of primes and let's evenquickly prove that's why that's the caseso any triple of primes threeconsecutive numbers none of which areprime so it means I'll have one numberthis court a that's prime the next oddnumbers there must be two places longwould also be prime and the next oddnumber which would be another two placeslong four places from the originalvelocity Prime's I'm seeking a set ofnumbers a a plus 2 a plus 4 all of whichare prime all right there's one example3 5 & 7 now let's look at these numbersthere are 3 possibilities for the numbera if I divided by 3 I might get aremainder of 0 remainder of 1 orremainder of 2 so there's only threepossibly isn't upon division by 3 now ifI do let's look at each case in turn ifElly's remainder of 0 upon division by 3I'm in trouble it's not prime history'seffect unless unless a was the number 3itself which case the case a being 0 canonly occur with the example already knowabout doneok fine but thereafter if a B'sremainder is 0 upon division by 3 it'snot prime so that's the only possibly inthis case all right let's look atdivision by remainder of 1if a Li's remainder of 1 upon divisionby 3 then a plus 2 would leave remainderof 1 plus 2 these remainder 3 pondivision by 3 those this guy isdivisible by 3 it won't be 3 itself infact it's gonna be bigger than 3therefore this guy's not primeso failed I can't be in the case of aleaving remainder of 1 upon division by3 let's look at the case of leaving aLi's remainder of 2 upon division by 3in which case look at this guy if aliasor major to than a plus for theseremainder of 6 upon division by 3 whichis immortal 3 so this guy would bedivisible by 3 in this third case andcan't be prime so actuallythe if Ailey's remainder of one I'm notgonna have a triple of primes if aliensare made of two I'm not gonna have atriple of primes the only way to have atriple of primes over there have a leavea remainder of zero and be the numberthree itself so that's it the list ofthe triple of primes is finite that'sthe only one example there is alright sosingles infinite so these Prime'sinfant and number triples are Prime'sfinite infinite here find out here thenthere's something in between the two thetwin primes are they infinite number orfinite in number well certainly thereseem to be a few of them that are 3 5 57 11 13 17 19 I think I skipped 29 31silly me 41 43 and so on well this is agood question how many these trip twinprimes are there well I'll tell you onething no one on this planet currentlyknows what they do know they're nottelling no one knows well the list oftwin primes goes on forever or whetherit eventually stops people keep findingexamples of larger and larger twinprimes but no one counting those if thatlist is ever going to dry up on that sothere we have it we're on the forefrontof current research mathematics if you'dlike to have a little optional homeworkassignment after watching this videoproved there inflame a twin Pryor's orprove that the list of winter rhymeseventually stops and if you do thatyou'll be world famous at least mostmathematicians alright
