national when you see the word rationalthat means ratio and ratio when youthink of a ratio you think of comparingtwo quantities like in a fractional formand root what root means is that that'sa solution of the equation it's whatmakes the equation equal to zero andthese are also the points where thegraph crosses the x-axis so that's theroots okay they call these rootssolutions x-intercepts zeroes will allmean the same thing and so the way wefind these rational roots is by takingall the factors of the constantsometimes we refer to that as P oroverall the factors of the leadingcoefficient this number here in front soall the factors of the constant meaningall the numbers are divided and evenlead to 12 all the integers divided byall the integers that dividing evenly 2into this leading coefficient 2 so ifwe're going to do that all the factorsof 12 are going to be plus or minus 1 23 4 6 and 12 and all the factors of theleading coefficient would just be plusor minus 1 plus or minus 2 so these areall the numbers of divided and evenly tothe leading coefficient so now what youcan do is you can take any number in thenumerator divided by any number in thedenominator and come up with a possiblerational root so these aren't guaranteedto be the roots but what it does is itnarrows down the possibilities that youcould try in order to find out you knowa root or a solution or zero of thispolynomial so you're narrowing down likeif I had to you know guess which numberwould make this equal to zero it mightbe awhile for me guessing I might tryand factor this and set the factors tozero but I might not be easily factoredit might not be in a form that Irecognize and that's where the rationalroot theorem comes in I can see thisisn't a quadratic it's a cubic so it's alittle bit more challenging to factor sohere's what we do we take the factors ofthe constant over the factors of leadingcoefficient if you want you can writethese out you could say like this isgoing to be plus or minus 1 over 1 whichis 1 this is going to be 2 over 1 whichis 2 so these all could be positive ornegative 3 46:12 or it could be 1/2 okay so I'lljust slip in 1/2 right there okay or itcould be 2 over 1 which is 2 arrow tohave listed 2 over 2 which is 1 3 over 2okay we don't have that one I'll putthat one in there 3 over 2 4 over 1 wehave that 4 over 2 is 2 we have that 6over 2 is 3 6 over 1 we have that 12over 2 which is 6 we have that so sothese are all the possible rationalroots now what we do to test them out iswe do synthetic division so let's let'ssay we wanted to test to see if 6 was aroot what we do is we go over here andwe do our synthetic division to negative12 22 and negative 12 and we do oursynthetic division so this is 1200 22120 130 to 120 so this one didn't comeout to 0 so that means that 6 is not azero it's not a root of this polynomialokay so cross that one off the listlet's try another one let's say we wantto try one okay so 2 negative 2 22negative 12 those are our coefficientswe're doing a synthetic division 2 2 0 022 22 okay and this comes out to 10 sooh I made a mistake because this is 12okay let's do that again so this wouldbe negative 10 this would be negative 10this would be 12 and then this would be12 and this would be 0 okay so there wego so that we have got 0 as a remainderso that means that 1 is a zero okay itis a root and what happens when you dothe synthetic division is this goes downby one degree so originally it was acubic now we're gonna be down to aquadratic so 2x squared minus 10x plus12 now that it's in the quadratic we cando the quadratic formulato find the other zeros or we can factorso here I'm just going to factor I'mgonna factor out the two and here I canfactor this into two binomials X minus 3and X minus 2 if I set these factorsequal to zero we get three or two okayso we have our zeros one two and threeokay so what that means is you can writethis in factored form it's going to betwo okay that's that two right thereX minus three X minus two okay and thenone was a zero so X minus the zero is afactor X minus the zero is a factor soit's X minus one so this is ourpolynomial here in factored formyou set the factor to zero you get thethe zeroes the x-intercepts and if wewanted to graph this it's going to crosshere at one two three the leadingcoefficient is positive so that tells usit's going to go up to the right it's anodd degree which tells it's going to gothe opposite way to the left so justmaking a rough sketch here the graphsgonna look something like that it'sgoing to cross at these points we havethe end behavior it's a quick way to geta sketch of this polynomial without youknow taking it to the next level so thisis basically just a quick way to get agraph finding the zeros using therational root theorem and go ahead andreview this video if you need to gothrough it one more time and I'll seeyou in the next video
