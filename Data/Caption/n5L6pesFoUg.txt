[Music]an angle bisector is a ray that takes anangle and divides it into two congruentangles so if we have this angle hereangle a b c i could draw an array thatwould perform an angle bisection so if idrew this in and again i'm notconstructing it here it will divide thiswhole angle ABC into two congruentangles so if I label this point D then Icould say that Ray BD so notice how I'dlabel that is an angle bisector so todifferentiate my angles from l's I liketo draw a little arc through them andtherefore we could say that angle abdwhich is that smaller angle angle abd iscongruent to D be C the other angle sowe've got angle D B and C or the otherway to say is the measure of the anglesis equal which comes in useful andactually I need an M here comes inuseful when you have variables thatyou're trying to solve for so in thisexample right here we have a ray that isan angle bisector which I can tellbecause it is being divided into twocongruent angles and I can find Xbecause I know these angles must equaleach other so what are you going to doyou're going to say that 2x minus sixwhich is one of your angles is equal toyour other angle which is 6x minus 9 sowhen you see your homework problem thatsays find X when you have variables justset them equal to each other if it is anangle bisector so to solve this justremembering what we did in algebra wewould subtract 2x from both sides and wewill have negative 6 is equal to 4xminus 9 and last or second the last wewould add 9 so negative 9 excuse mepositive 9 and negative 6 is positive 3and last we would divide and I see thatI'm going to get a fraction X is 3/4 sothe way that we found X was saying thatsince this ray is an angle bisector itwill divide that angle into twocongruent angles and then we set themequal to each otherand solved so remember that when you'reusing angle bisectors you are creatingtwo congruent angles
