all right in this video I'm going to doanother example of predicting the typesof solutions to a quadratic equationusing the discriminant so again thediscriminant is just the part under thesquare root the b squared minus 4ac soin this case we've got the problem 2xsquared plus 6x minus 6 equals negative8 again before you start plugging thingsinyou know the quadratic formula or twothe discriminant you always need oneside of the equation to be equal to 0 sothe first thing I'm going to have to doin this case is simply add 8 to bothsides so then we're gonna have 2xsquared plus 6x negative 6 plus 8 isgoing to give us positive 2 equals 0 andagain the positive 2 that's gonna be oura value the positive 6 that's gonna beour B value and the positive 2 that'sgonna be our C value so when we fill inthe B squared minus 4ac the discriminantwe're gonna end up getting so we'll haveB which is 6 squared minus 4 times awhich is 2 times C which is also 2 sofor the discriminant 6 squared is goingto be 36 4 times 2 is 8 8 times 2 is 16so we're gonna have 36 minus 16 whichwill give us a positive 20 so since thediscriminant is a positive number whatthat tells us in this case is that wehave two real solutions I should say tworeal you can even clarify distinctsolutionsand therefore we have zero complexsolutions
