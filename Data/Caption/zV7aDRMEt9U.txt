so let's say we're given an isoscelestriangle with a vertex angle thatmeasures X degrees and a base angle thatmeasures 70 degrees and were asked tofind the value of X remember that theisosceles triangle theorem states thatif two sides of a triangle are congruentthen the angles opposite those sides arecongruent so here since we have twocongruent sides and the angle oppositeone of the congruent sides measures 70degrees then we know that the otherangle opposite the other congruent sidemust also measure 70 degrees now to findthe value of x remember that the sum ofthe measures of the angles of a triangleis 180 degreesso we can set up the equation X plus 70Plus 70 equals 180 simplifying on theleft side 70 Plus 70 is 140 so we have Xplus 140 equals 180 and subtracting 140from both sides we find that x equals 40so the angles of this isosceles trianglemeasure 70 70 and forty degrees
