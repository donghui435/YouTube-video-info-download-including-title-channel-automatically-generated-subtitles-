okay today we're going to take a reallybrief introduction to anti-derivativesin an indefinite integration all rightwords you can take those two topics anddo a nice brief introduction into thosethis video is going to be part 1 of 2all right and in the second examplewe'll go through more examples all rightbut you really do need to have afoundation before you start that at thebeginning of our chapter in our textbookwhere we're starting to deal withintegration they use this antiderivativeword okay it's an older word I introduceit I will introduce it here give formaldefinition all right but then later inmy classes particularly i'd usuallydon't use the word antiderivative oranti and differentiation I we do theindefinite integration and that's thewords I use but for formal definitionhere um the definition of anantiderivative is a function capital Fokay notation izle means a lot here thefunction a function capital F is anantiderivative of little F on aninterval I if capital F prime of x isequal to f of X for all X in I or inthat interval okay so yes formaldefinition might not totally make senseall right but basically you can just getthe idea of an antiderivative okay bythinking of it as undoing yourderivative all right that's a nicelittle easy way to ease into what it isall right so some for some really simpleexamples here let's say I ended up I'vegot some function here and when I get areally really simple function here likef of X equals say 2x all right now if Iwant to try to find the antiderivativejust by doing a trial and error thinkabout process that sort of thing allright I need to come up with a capital Faccording to this definition capital fof X all right some function that when Itook the derivative Iend up with 2x okay so I'm thinkingpower rule pulling that exponent down infront and then subtracting one all rightso I would have had to have an x squaredall right as my anti derivative becauseif i take the derivative here it wouldbe a 2x pulling that two down in frontof subtracting 1 from the exponent okayso kind of your undoing your derivativeall right now that that was reallyreally simple all right let's say I hadanother one here might be a little bitharder f of X is equal to maybe say an xsquared all right so what would theantiderivative be all right well if Iended up with the two up here thenbefore I took the derivative I wouldhave had to have a three because wesubtract one all right now the questionis if I ended up with a one here whatwould have had to have been here when Ipulled that three down two x two ghettoon well hopefully you can see that thatwould have been a one-third all right sothere's my antiderivative ok pullingthat three down one third times threewould give me the one subtracting 1 fromthe exponent would give me the two thereall right now this is kind of like alittle game and we're just kind ofplaying and we're thinking it throughand it can work all right these arereally really simple functions these arereally simple anti-derivatives all thefunctions that we deal with are notgoing to be that simple ok so we aregoing to have to come up with a generalsolution all right so let's take a lookat the general solution and then getsome more definitions in here alright sothis is where I want to connect andmaybe start calling it an indefiniteintegration here alrightantidifferentiation the act of doing itis also called an indefinite integrationokay so we're going to call itintegration that's the more common wordtoday I use that on a regular basisalright and we will start out with theindefinite ones which just means we'regoing to have a general solution hereokay now formal definition of this inour textbook is the integral symbolwhich is that will shape right therealright so I'm going to integratef of X DX and that will be equal tocapital f of X plus C all right now Iwant to go through and define all ofthose things all right and tell us whatwe're looking at here okay the functionthat you are integrating all right iscalled your integrand so that's myintegrand all right the DX here this Xright here tells me my variable ofintegration all right so variable ofintegration because functions can bewritten in terms of why they can bewritten in terms of other letters so Idon't always have an X here all rightthis right here is going to be theantiderivative the antiderivative of fof X all right and then this plus C outhere is our constant of integration andit gives us our general solution so it'sa constant of integration all right sobeing able to read it and understandwhat's going on here is going to kind ofreally be important okay now like I saidin our textbook we use capital F hereand and little up here they do this foryour their formal definition but I liketo show students a little bit somethingdifferent we normally do not name ourfunctions with capital letters all righti usually don't say no capital f ofwhatever and then take the derivative ofit we usually use a little F to denoteall of our functions and then when wetake the derivative we do F prime okayso this formula and let's just go aheadand put it in red all right using thenotation more commonly that's used atleast in my class if we integrate thederivative of x DX then we're going toget back the original function and inour classic would be just plain f of X+ C so using all the lower case lettersand denoting your derivative F primeokay this is what's more commonly usedin my class and it kind of seems to makemore sense for the students all right soI just thought I'd point that out ok nowwe're going to go into and take a lookat just four basic integration rules allright and then we're going to call thisquits on part one here the first basicintegration rule we want to take a lookat is if we integrate 0 DX all right anytime we integrate 0 DX we should get aconstant all right and then stop andthink about that okay if I have somerandom number like four or whatever andthen i take the derivative of it it goesto 0 all right so that's that one shouldbe self-explanatory okay now this one ifi integrate some number DX that's goingto integrate to the number and then xplus c all right now let's pull out anddo some examples of that so in otherwords if i was going to integrate for DXokay according to this all right I wouldhave an answer of 4x plus C alright andthen ask yourself stop and think doesthis make sense all right for X if itake the derivative of 4x i get for allright so then it does make sense allright third rule here says if iintegrate and I've got some number timesmy function DX then I can pull thatnumber out in front of the integral signand then go ahead and continue tointegrate like normal all right so let'skind of look at an example there withoutactually doing the integration let's saymaybe I was integrating for sine X DXokay my function right there sine Xthere's my number in front so i can pullthis out in front of the integrationsign so I pull the four out in front andthen I've got sine X DX alright and thenI would continue to integrate that andthen come up with final answeralright and we're not going into thatright Aaron this one because we're justgetting some basics for this all rightand then last basic integration rulehere basically says if you'reintegrating two functions all right andeither adding or subtracting it reallydoesn't make any difference usually theydo put square brackets around everythingthat you are integrating inside hereokay especially when you've got plusesand minuses in there that keeps the DXand the integral sign the set separateyou can take this and break it up whoopsyou can take it and break it up into twoseparate integrals all right now noticewhen you do that you've got the integralof f of X DX you've got to make sure andput the DX there and then plus or minuswhichever you would happen to be doingand then integrating G of X DX and theimportant thing is to make sure thatevery time you've got that integral signyou've got to also have the DX or youryour variable of integration thereindicated for each one of those allright so for this first video I justwanted to do a really really briefintroduction into the wordantiderivative anti differentiation andsome indefinite integration thanks forwatching if you liked the video go aheadand give me a thumbs up and be sure toshare with your friends thanks
