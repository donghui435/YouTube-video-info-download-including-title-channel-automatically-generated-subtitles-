an abstract artist wants to create twoproportional triangular paintings thedimensions of one painting are shown andthat's this top one right over here howlong should the two missing sides be inthe second painting so there are twoproportional triangular paintings or oneway to think about it's gonna be twotriangles that are similar and actuallywe know based on how these triangles aremarked up that they are similartriangles you have this angle this anglewith these two arcs right over here ithas the same measure as that angle rightover there this angle with the threearcs has the same measures this angleright over there and that this angle letme do it in a new colorwith the one arc has the same measure asthis angle right over there if the ifthe corresponding angles are have thesame measure of the corresponding anglesare congruent then we know that theseare similar triangles the other thingthat tells you about similar trianglesor if you know that two triangles aresimilar that means that the ratiobetween corresponding sides is going tobe the same so let's look at thecorresponding sides and then let's tryto figure out that same ratio or usethat same ratio so we can figure out themissing sides right over here so thefirst thing if you look at the sidethat's opposite this blue angle this onearc angle side XY over here that's goingto correspond to the side that'sopposite in this blue angle over here soside a B these are corresponding sidesyou could also view it as a side betweenthe orange and the magenta the sidebetween the orange and the magentalikewise this side right over herethat's opposite the origin go it'sopposite the orange the double arc angleis going to correspond to this sidethat's opposite the orange double arcangle or you could view it as a sidethat's between the magenta and the blueangle and then finally let me use it wehave this side which is opposite themagenta angle it's opposite the magentaangle it's between the blue and theorange angles is going to correspond tothis side which is opposite the magentaangle and between the blue and orangeangles so what this tells us is that theratio we know since they are similar theratio between corresponding sides isgoing to be the same so the ratiobetween these two sidesa be 2xy the ratio between the length ofside a b and length of side XY is goingto be equal to the ratio between thelength of side BC and the length of sidey z which is going to be equal to theratio of AC AC to X Z and they tell uswhat some of these lengths are they tellus a B is equal to 5 they tell us thatXY is equal to 2 they tell us that BC isequal to 9 and Y Z is one of the thingswe're going to have to solve for butthey also tell us that AC is equal to 10all right no one I want to use themagenta AC is equal to 10 and we alsohave to solve for X C so we can actuallyget this you know this triple equalitywe can actually create two separateequations each of which have one unknownand then we can solve for that unknownso the first is you have five halves isequal to 9 over Y Z is equal to 9 9 overY Z and to solve for y Z was a bunch ofways that you could do it but you couldjust let's see we can multiply Y Z timesboth sides you could multiply Y Z timesboth sides Y is e times both sidesactually I won't swell like you come upto and then we can multiply both sidesby 2/5 but let's just do one step at atime so then you get Y Z Y Z times fivehalves times five halves is equal to 9is equal to 9 and then you can multiplyboth sides times the reciprocal of fivehalves so you multiply both sides times2/5 and we're doing that so that we canisolate the Y Z and then this right overhere these cancel out on the left handside we're left with just Y Z and on theright hand side we are left with 9 times2 is 18 over 5 and we can turn that thisis the same thing if we write it as amixed number 5 goes into 18 three timeswith a remainder of 3 so it's 3 and 3/5which is the same thing as 3 point 6 soY Z over here is going to be 3 point 6so we've done one on the sides now wehave to figure out what XZ is and sohere we know that five halfs we knowthat five halves is going to be equal to10 over X Z is going to be equal to 10over X Z and once again we can multiplythere's multiple ways you could do ityou could flip both sides of thisequation so you could say now so I'll doit in a slightly different way than wedid it that way just just so there'smultiple ways to solve this you couldsay 2 over 5 is equal to XZ over 10 soI'm just taking the reciprocal of bothsides and then multiply both sides ofthis equation by 10 multiply both sidesby 10 so you're left with XZ is equal to10 times 2 is 20 divided by 5 so this isgoing to be 4 so X Z ends up being 4that is 4 and we're donethe smaller painting has dimensions 23.6 and 4
