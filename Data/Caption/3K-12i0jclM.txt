JAMES CLEWETT: I want to
talk about number 41.41 is a number which crops up
in "Garden of Rama." Which,when I was a teenage boy, was
just about my favorite book.I loved Arthur C
Clarke's stuff.He really enjoyed educating
in a really subtle way.And so in this book--page 53, I checked--rather randomly, we suddenly
find that we're doing somesort of quadratic mathematics.So as a teenage boy, I didn't
understand this at all.I looked at it.I thought, yeah, that's nice.And part of me wished
I could do that.But then I moved on.So what I want to do today is
actually take you through thisand explain to you what Arthur
C Clarke was talking about,and why it is kind of cute.It's the heroine's
41st birthday.And her husband is a
mathematics geek.And he takes it upon himself
to explain to her why 41 issuch a magical number.Real people don't
talk like this.I work in a maths and
physics department.And even the geekiest
mathematicians that I knowdon't actually talk like this.So I just want to reassure you
that this is a fictional work.- Give us an excerpt.JAMES CLEWETT: OK.Well, "Therefore, the entire
series can generate a simplequadratic expression.Take f equals n squared minus
m plus 41," he continued,"where n is an integer
between 0 and 40.That function will generate
your entire sequence.Better still," he laughed,
"consider f equals n squaredminus 81 m plus 1681, where n
is an integer from 1 to 80.This quadratic formula starts
at the tail end of theoriginal series, with f equals
1,601, and proceeds throughthe sequence, decreasing order
first, then reversing itselfto f equals 41, and generates
the entire array in increasingorder."No Nobody talks like that.- Sorry, I fell asleep.Are you still going?[LAUGHTER]Go on.JAMES CLEWETT: As a teenager,
I wanted to be like this.I thought that that
was really cool.And so I guess this speaks to
me and was a part of, again,why I became a physicist
in the first place.- Well James, I'm going to make
your dreams come true.JAMES CLEWETT: Thank you.- Because this is your chance to
talk like that and explainthat to us.[INAUDIBLE].JAMES CLEWETT: OK.Let's try and make this
make some sense.And we are going to have
to do some math.But bear with me, OK?Because I'm going to try and
make that math make sense.OK, so let's start by writing
down the equation that they'retalking about.And that is a simple quadratic
formula f equals n squaredminus n plus 41.Now don't be intimidated.Because all we're going to do is
we're going to say for anygiven value of n, what
is the value of f?Let's make a table, shall we?So if I put in, n equals 0,
then I have 0 squaredminus 0, plus 41.Which is simply 41.OK?I put in a value of 1 I have
1 squared, which is 1,minus 1 plus 41.So that's simply 1.If I put in a value of
2, I get 2 squared.That's 2 times 2 is 4,
minus 2 plus 41.That's 43.And so on.I put in 3.And so I get 9 minus 3, that's
6, plus 41 is 47.And exactly as Richard Wakefield
was saying in thebook, what we're generating
here is asequence of prime numbers.Every number that we get for
plugging in a value of n fromnaught to 40 is a
prime number.Now if I plug-in the value of
n of 41, what I get is thevalue which is 41 times by 41.Which is also a rather
cute littlesymmetry to this problem.- So you've got this big
sequence of prime numbers.JAMES CLEWETT: Uh-huh.Which goes up to-- for a value
of 40, that goes up to 1,601.So we've skipped a few there.But they're all prime numbers,
all the way to 1,601.- You're going to show me
something cool now, yeah?JAMES CLEWETT: Yeah,
I think so.What I'm going to show you is
a little something that wasfirst done by Ulam--Stanislaw Ulam--in 1963 while he was bored,
sitting in a presentation.And so he began just
to scribble away.I'm going to start with
the number 41 in themiddle of the page.And I'm going to scribble
a spiral of numbers.So the next number is 42.54, 57--- [INAUDIBLE]JAMES CLEWETT: I'm just making
a spiral of numbers.And at the end of that, I'm just
going to get to just acouple more her.60, 61--so what I want to show is how
these numbers relate to ouroriginal series of numbers
generated from themathematics.OK so our first number
in the series, for nequals 1, we get 41.And I've put that
in the middle.Nice big circle.There you go.Then our second number is 43.And I've put that one up here.47, it's down here.The next number, if I put in n
equals 4, the next number Iwould find would be 53.That's up here.And then we continue
and we find 61.61 is down here.And so on.And so what we're discovering
is that all of the primenumbers generated by the
quadratic series are found onthis diagonal, the lead
diagonal, of what we'recalling an Ulam spiral.- And every number in that
series as you go down is goingto sit along this line here.Is that--JAMES CLEWETT: Every number in
the series is going to be onthat diagonal line
in this spiral.Now, this is neat because we
don't need to start with 41.We could start with
any number.And I invite you to try
and do this at home.Start with any number.1, for example.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13--keep going.Keep going as long as
you feel inclined.And then go back with a red
pen and just draw a circlearound the prime numbers.3, 5, 7, 13--I missed one at 11.So you develop diagonal lines
through the system.And I can draw in other
diagonal lineswhich would be found--and if you keep doing this.- But 9 is not a prime.JAMES CLEWETT: 9
is not a prime.No.There will be gaps.OK?But the fact is that there's
this amazing pattern that justemerges out of nature.Where you see these diagonal
lines in clusters.So if you keep doing this for
enough numbers, then you endup with huge arrays
of diagonal lines.Which I'd like to show you.Not only on a Cartesian
coordinate system where we'rebuilding a square spiral.But we can plot them
on, for example,an Archimedes' spiral.And then you get a fabulous
pattern which willlook a bit like this.But 41's really sweet because 41
is the biggest number whichwe can put into our original
formula, which generates aseries of primes.We could have used 11, or
17, or 5, or 3, or 2.And that would generate short
series of prime numbers.41 is the biggest one which
generates a series of allprime numbers.So this is why our hero in the
book likes this series.He likes it because it generates
40 prime numbers.And then he can make it mirror
itself and generate them allbackwards if he wants
to as well.Because he's a clever
chap like that.- But you couldn't
do this with 43?JAMES CLEWETT: No.Absolutely not.This is quite a unique set of
numbers that will actuallygenerate these.So it was Euler that he first
did this in 1772.So Arthur C Clarke is being a
little bit disingenuous whenhe claims that Richard
Wakefield isdoing it over dinner.But nonetheless, it's still
very, very nice thing.Euler is a famous mathematician,
and geometristgoing back two centuries.Ulam is the guy who was sitting
bored in a seminar oneday and decided to write
numbers in a spiral.As you do, obviously.But Ulam was an interesting
chap in his own right.He was part of the Manhattan
Project.He holds the patent for
the atomic bomb--or the thermonuclear bomb.Which is an odd one.Because if somebody steals your
patent, then you don'tneed a patent lawyer.You need a weapons system.That always amused me.He also, he was responsible for
Project Orion, which was aproject to launch spaceships
the size of small frigatesinto space using a small series
of nuclear explosions.This was all before
they understoodabout nuclear fall-out.He wanted to launch spacecrafts
with crews of 200people on board.And actually, Orion is still
seen as probably the only waythat we have to do interstellartravel on human lifetimes.So he was quite a clever guy.And in his spare time,
he drew spirals.BRADY HARAN: If you haven't
seen our other video aboutthese spirals and prime numbers
that was uploadedaround the same time
as this one--and you probably already
have seen it.Because you probably came
here from that video.Well if you haven't seen
it, there's a link.You can go and check it out.And if you'd like to find out
more about James Clewett, howhe became a physicist, why, even
footage from his Ph.D.viva, which is something you
don't see every day--there's also links for that.Go and have a look.
