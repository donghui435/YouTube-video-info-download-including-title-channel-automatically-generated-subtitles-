let's see let's see what we can do hereokay by the way just as a bit of a hintoh not necessarily here but somethingthat might help you remember I start offwith the definition of just regularsymmetry like symmetry of a general typeright and we said symmetry is orsymmetry is when and then I gave you adefinition do you still have that theregot it okay now I am going to give you adefinition and I want you to hear howsimilar it is to the previous one okayand then one packet so rotationalsymmetry is and here's my sentence whichI'd love you to write underneath yoursokay is when you can rotate a shaperightand after rotating it you will get thesame shape exactly the same shape inexactly the same place right you getexactly the same shape and I'm verypleased if some of you have used eventhat phrase because that's how we'retrying to understand this whole ideaexactly the same shape in exactly thesame place okay now lots of shapes thatyou know have rotational symmetry okayso let's think of some examples okayyeah there's nothing this one okay I'mgoing to draw a circle up here I willcome back to the circle in a momentthough I want to think of a simplest Iknow circles very simple but I want tothink of a simpler shape yeah a squareexcellent now if you have not thought ofthat that's okay but I wouldn't like itought to draw a square okay veryimportantnow you remember before I would give ashape and then I'll reflect it acrossright and then we were label we withlevel two points and then see whathappens okay so for instance um thisshape here right it's a square I'm goingto call it square a/b c/dokaynow just like how reflectional symmetryright you had a a special line and youcould reflect across it and that's whereit was symmetrical what do we call thatspecial line started with an A thearishok the ax is good I had a few toughthat's okay uh the axis of symmetryright well when you rotate things theingredients that go into rotation it'snot a straight line right what's theingredient it goes into this yeah yes apoint I've actually drawn in here okayso we call that the center of symmetryokay now just like how you haveingredients that go into a reflection orrotation right what do I need I needmore than a point don't I what else do Ihave to talk about if I want to have arotation I need what do I need yeah Ineed an angle good because for instancejust have a look at this don't draw thisbut um just as an example right supposeI were to rotate this 45 degrees 45degrees what would happen okay well I'mguessing I'm guessing you look somethinglike this is that about rightsee a hey that's become a 1 right big itwould become B 1 you get the idea nowlet's have a look at this this is notthe exact same shape in the same placeis it right but a square really doeshave a rotational symmetry so cansomeone give me a suggestion or howshould I rotate it instead 45 degreesdoesn't work what could I do as analternativeyeah she's 90 degrees okay so I've gotmy a/b c/d here okay so when I rotate itand I'd love you to do this as well ifyou've got another color that willreally help miss a right where is itgoing to go it's gonna come around tohere it's gonna rotate around this pointokay so a will become a 1 over hereright on top of B in the same way B isgonna become B 1 over here right on topof C and so onokay so now when I connect these all upI have a very Christmassy looking squarebut the important thing is it's theexact same shape in the exact same place
