so this is the range this is very easyto calculate unfortunately if I haveoutliers in my data it makes the rangealmost useless so then we have to goback to our original question how can wemeasure how spread apart our data iswithout kind of being susceptible to theoutlier problem or at least reduce oursensitivity to the outlier problem andthe answer to that question is somethingextremely important in statistics andthat is the concept of variance that'sthe concept of variance all right sowe've done the range we figured out howto do that now we're going to try tocalculate something called the variancewhich is going to tell us how spreadapart the data is in a way that's notquite as susceptible to outliers sothat's very very important and theconcept of variance I'm going to tellyou right now along with standarddeviation which we'll get to in a littlebit the concept of variance is nevergoing to leave you in statistics so youreally need to make sure just likeunderstanding the mean very importantunderstanding the variance extremelyimportant so instead of just puttingdown the equation for variance which Icould do and be done I'm going to leadyou through a logical kind ofwalkthrough of what it means and so thatway you'll know what the equation is forvariance but you'll also know in yourgut what it really means because that'swhat you really need to to think aboutand that's what you really need tointernalize so let's say that you havesome data set I'm just kind of drawing apicture here and this could be a list ofnumbers it could be that the height ofpeople in a room could be the age ofpeople could be there you know if theylike peanut butter more than jelly oh itdoesn't really matter but usually it'snumerical data so for the kind of thesake of argument think of it as the agesof people in a room or something likethat so we've learned in this course sofar that when you have a bunch of datawe can calculate the mean and the meanis the it's kind of like themiddle-of-the-road value right it's kindof like a representative number thatkind of goes cuts right to the middle ofthe data set the center of gravity so tospeak of the data set and we use thex-bar notation when we're talking aboutsayingfull data right this is the sample meanand the way you get it is you add allthe values up in your sample and youdivide by the number of samples and thenyou get that number that represents themean of the sample all rightso if I wanted to look at each datapoint visualize this cloud as a bunch ofdata points you know I've got some datapoints here some data points here whichare different values and here is kind ofthe mean now if I wanted to look at eachindividual data point and figure out howfar it is from the mean then I'm kind ofmeasuring the spread of each individualdata point right because remember whatwe're trying to do is we're trying tofigure out how spread out our data is soinstead of just doing the range which isthe end points we want to look at everysingle data point in our set figure outhow far away it is from the mean andsomehow roll that into a calculationthat we can then calculate the variancewhich is how spread the data is so ifwe're just going to examine one pointand only one point right now then whatwe would find is for each point for eachdata point the deviation from the meanis very very simple nothing toocomplicated here the data value minusthe mean I mean that's very very simpleright so in other words if I have a datapoint here it's it's 1 and I want tofigure out how in the mean is like 5then if I want to figure out thedeviation from the mean of this datapoint I'm just going to subtract and I'mgoing to take my data point I'm going tosubtract away the mean and that's goingto give me how far away this from themeanif I've got a data point over here like7 and the mean is 5 well then I'm goingto take that 7 I'm going to subtract 5away that tells me how far away thatpoint is so you might think that that bylooking at each individual data pointsubtracting the mean from it that givesus a nice indicator of the spread of thedata and you would you would be right soone way with that we might roll it intoone calculation what we might want to dois add up all these little deviationsthe mean of every single data point inour set when I see say X sub I insteadof being scared by that what you need tothink of as X sub I is just the ice datapoint I have maybe five data points so Isub one I sub two I said three four andfive those are just the individual datapoints so when you see something like Xsub I minus the out of the average valueor the mean X bar what you're doing isyou're taking every data pointsubtracting the mean and then you getthat number and you do it again andagain for every single data point you'resubtracting from the mean you get thosedifferences and you add them up that'swhat the Sigma does over here you addthem up so if we add up all thesedifferences from the data points to themean and then divide by the number ofdata points that we have then what we'vereally done is we've averaged thedeviations of all the points from themean now I'm going to say that again soincredibly important right what we'vedone is we've taken every data point wesubtract the mean that gives us thedeviation of every point in our set fromthe mean okay then we add up all thedeviations and we divide by the numberof points so what we're doing is we'reaveraging the deviations of all of ourpoints about the mean we're getting anaverage value this is a nice way torepresent the average you know varianceis what we're calling it from the meanit gives us the spread of the databecause we're not just looking at theendpoints like with the range we'relooking at every point finding out howfar away it is from the mean and we'regetting all those differences from themean then we're averaging them allbecause all the points are equallyweighted and so we get a number out ofit that tells us to get a really bignumber it tells us yeah a lot of thesepoints are far away from the mean if weget a really small number in thiscalculation it tells us yeah all thesepoints are kind of close to the meanbecause all the deviations were reallysmall that's what we're doing here allright so let me write a couple thingsdown here I'm just going to kind of putwhat I have on my page this does theaveraging right now this is not thefinal answer of what we really want todo to calculate the variance becausethere's one big problem with this butthe thought process is what's importanthere we're going to make one change totheand then we'll be done the problem isnotice that we have data on the lefthand side of the main and data on theright hand side of the main you'realways going to have that because themean by definition is kind of like thecenter of your data set it's acalculated value that kind of is at likethe center of gravity of your datacenter kind of there's some points belowit there's some points above it that'salways the way means are right so if Ihave the calculation written as the datapoint minus the mean then for all ofthese data points over here let'spretend the mean was five all of thesedata points are greater than five sothen one of the data points might beseven minus five and then another datapoint might be ten minus five and thenanother data point might may you knowsix minus five and then may be twelveminus five there could be lots of datapoints the mean is always the same andyou're subtracting the data value minusthe mean right but then look whathappens on the other side of the meanall of these data points are actuallysmaller than the mean so if we actuallydo this calculation then I'm going tohave some points over here minus themean so if again if this mean we're fiveand the data points are here are smallerthan five I could have three minus fiveI can have two minus five I can havefour minus five in all of those casesthree minus 5/2 minus five four - fiveI'm going to get a negative number onthe top because I have a small numberminus a big number so the problem withdoing this calculation even though itmakes perfect sense to us is that halfof the data points are going to give usnegative values on the top the otherhalf of the data points are going togive us positive values on the top sosince I'm adding them all together andhalf of the data points are going togive me negative deviations and theother half of the points are going togive me positive deviations when I sumthem all together in this calculationI'm going to always get 0 which is notwhat I want I want to find a number thatrepresents the spread of the data andalthough it makes perfect logical sensebecause I'm subtracting the mean andbecause the mean is always in the middleI'm always going to get negative valueson the top along with positive valuesand so I'm always going to end upgetting 0 if I do this calculation as isso to cut to the chase we're going tomake a small modelvacation and we're going to call thisthe variance which I'll explain this ina minute but it's called the varianceright and it is exactly what I havewritten before you have Sigma X I've -the average value of the mean divided bycapital and everything is exactly thesame but we make one change we squarethis guy right here this is what we callthe variance in fact I'm going to writeit as population variance so I'm goingto circle this because it's very veryimportant population variance this issomething this is a core you knowstatistical concept it really is it'slike if you're studying algebra you haveto learn about X&Y well if you'restudying statistics you have to learnabout variance it is absolutelyfundamentally central to everything thatwe're going to do now and everything tofollow so you need to make sure youunderstand itwhat we've done is we've done exactlythe same calculation so all of the logicthat I spent a lot of time explaining toyou is true the only thing that we didis we take the sample value minus themean and we get the number and then wesquare it so we're getting the deviationfrom the mean and then we square it andthen we do that for all data points soif your mean is five you might have sixminus five and seven month five eightand ten minus five and you're squaringeach of those differences okayso then on the right hand side we getpositive deviations we're going tosquare them they're going to get biggeron the left hand side when we have thesenegative issue that pops up you know 3minus 5 2 minus 5 you know 1 minus 5 wewould get negative values but we squareit the squaring action makes it positiveso we get all of the deviations of allof the points from the mean and wesquare them all you do the squaringfirst right in fact it might even makemore sense if you want you could put alittle bracket around here if you likejust to kind of show that the squaringaction is done before any of theaddition so for every data point wesubtract from the mean we square it andthen we do that for every data point andwe add them all up and we completelysidestep the problem of having halfnegative values and half positive valuesleading to nowhereleading to zero so no matter what yourdata points are you're always going toget a positive value on the top youdivide by the pot by the number ofsamples this is averaging the deviationsyou're still averaging the deviationsthe only thing is you're squaring themfirst just to get around this wholenegative issue that we talked about sothis is called the variance the symbolhere is is actually a Sigma so let mewrite that down for you this is Sigmathis is also Sigma this is a capitalGreek letter called Sigma this is alowercase Greek letter Sigma the reasonwe have the square here is just toremind us that this is a measure of thedeviation which you're calling thevariance in this case variance about themean but all of these variances aresquared and so that's why the square isthere it's just to remind you it's notto tell you to calculate anything moreit's just to remind you that this isactually modeling a variance of all thedata that falls around the mean and howspread apart it is but we've kind ofmodified the actual difference in we'vesquared everything and then we did thatso that we didn't get a zero answer soit's very common in a book you'll seeSigma squared all over the place whenyou see this sig symbol in a book with asquare like this you just need toreplace it mentally in your head with ohthis is just a spread of the datathe bigger this number is whatever I'vecalculated the more spread out the datais the smaller that number is the closerthat data is packed and when I say thecloser it's packed I mean the closerit's packed around it's mean when I saythe farther spread apart it is I meanthe farther spread apart it is about itsmean all right one more thing I want tosay before we close this is a populationvariance okay population it means thatall data points in our in our populationthat's what population variance is rightbut don't forget that we're in thebusiness of taking samples right so thesample because you're probably nevergoing to know the population varianceyou're not going to know all the datapoints so when rialwhat you do is you take a sample we'vetalked about this many times and youarrive at s squared you have to choose adifferent symbol right because this isthe sample variance I told you a longtime ago you need to understand thedifference between a sample and apopulation and this is the reason why sothis is exactly the same thing over nminus 1 all right and this is called thesample variance now notice there's onemajor difference here there's two majordifferences the sample variancerepresents how spread apart the samplesthat I've taken are about the samplemean all right the sample mean isdenoted x-bar okay we're doing it thesame calculation the reason it's n minus1 on the bottom this is the number ofsamples I have minus 1 that's just aconvention there the reason why there'sa minus 1 here goes way beyond the scopeof this class what you need to rememberis that when you have a sample a finiteset of samples you have n minus 1 on thebottom when you're doing thiscalculation when you have the entirepopulation at your disposal and for somereason if you knew all the data pointsin the population then you would divideby n the total number of people in thepopulation now one thing I need tomodify here just as I did my descriptionI showed you all this stuff because Iwas trying to kind of make it reallyclear for you since this is a populationvariance okay instead of x-bar thebetter way to write this the way thatyou would see it in your book is minusmu right since it's a populationvariance because remember when we talkedabout populations the population mean wecall mu the sample mean we call x-barlike this so this is the most importantthing to this lesson and I want you totry to internalize it trying tounderstand it follow me on to the nextlesson we're going to work more problemswhen we're actually trying to calculatethese variances the most important thingfor you to know is that all data isgoing to have a certain amount ofdispersion or spread right when you talkabout spread you really care about howspread apart it is about its mean that'swhat you really care about right whenyou have samplewhen you have actual data you've goneout and collected then you have a samplemean which we know how to calculate wetake the difference between every datapoint and its sample mean we square thedifferences we divide by the number ofsamples minus one that gives ussomething s squared notice samplevariance s goes with s so sample and sso that when you see s squared you knowthat it's the variance of the samplesthat you've taken right that's how youdo that calculation for a populationwhich is everybody if you knew theactual population mean and if you knewevery single data point of thepopulation like every person in theUnited States of America then you couldcalculate the population variance whichis denoted by Sigma square so in bothcases the calculations very very similarit's just in a population case we aredividing by the number of people in thepopulation in the sample case we'redividing by the samples minus one butfundamentally it's the same sort ofthing most important thing you need toknow is when you see a sigma squaredlike this guy you need to thinkpopulation variances talking about ourpopulation when you see an S squaredlike that you need to think they'retalking about our sample that we'vetaken and that's why I took so much timeearlier to make sure you understand thedifference between the sample and apopulation and a sample mean and apopulation mean because in this case thecalculation is actually different fromthe population to the sample so makesure you understand this follow me on tothe next section where we will get somepractice calculating these things andyou'll find that it's not very hard
