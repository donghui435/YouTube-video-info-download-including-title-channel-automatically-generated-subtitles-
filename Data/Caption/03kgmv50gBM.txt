welcome to my video on multiplying anddividing complex numbers the idea ofmultiplying complex numbers is exactlythe same as using the foil method it's alittle different simplifying at the endbut I think once you see this examplethe idea is exactly the same so let'sget started right away here we have 5plus 2i being multiplied by 4 minus 3iso we want to use the foil method sofirst I'm going to multiply 5 times 4 5times 4 is equal to 20 now I'm going tomultiply 5 times negative 3i which isequal to negative 15 I and now I canmultiply the positive 2i times apositive 4 which will give me a positive8i and if I multiply a positive 2i timesa negative 3i that's going to give me anegative 6i squared and before we moveon let's go back and review for a secondwe know that the imaginary number I isequal to the square root of negative 1and if we square both sides of thisequation we get I squared on the leftside and on the right side the squareand the square root cancel out and we'rejust left with negative 1 so we have weknow that I squared is equal to negative1 so every single place there's an Isquared we can replace that with anegative 1 and notice in our expressionhow we have an I squared so I'm going toreplace this I squared with a negative 1and everything else in the expressionstays the same if we start on the leftwe have 20 minus 15 I plus 8i and wehave a negative 6 being multiplied bythe negative 1 and now we just need tokeep on simplifying as much as possibleon the left we still have our 20 and inthe middle we have two like terms wehave a negative 15 I and we have apositive 8i negative 15 plus 8 isnegative 7iand on the right we have negative sixtimes negative one which is equal topositive sixso now we still have like terms we havea positive 20 and we have a positive 6so we can simplify this even further 20plus 6 is equal to 26 and we still haveour negative 7i so here is our solutionto the expression 26 minus 7i now let'sgo over an example where we divideimaginary numbers so here we have 4 plus2 I divided by 3 minus I and wheneveryou're dividing complex numbers you cannever leave an imaginary number in thedenominator so our first step in thisproblem is to get rid of this imaginarynumber in the denominator and to do thiswe need to multiply by the conjugate andthe conjugate is exactly the same as thedenominatorexcept you change the sign in front ofthe I term so instead of 3 minus i we'regoing to have a 3 plus I notice how thethe sign in front of the I term haschanged and whatever you do to thebottom you also have to do to the top sowe're multiplying the top and bottom bythe conjugate 3 plus I and now we have awhole bunch of foiling that we have todo so I'll start with the denominator inthe denominator we have 3 times 3 whichis equal to 9 we have 3 times positive Iwhich is equal to positive 3i and wealso have negative I times positive 3which is equal to negative 3i and wehave negative I times positive I whichis equal to negative I squared now let'sdo the same thing for the numerator inthe numerator we have 4 times positive 3which is equal to 12 we also havepositive 4 times I which is equal topositive 4 I we have positive 2i timespositive 3 which isequal to positive six I and we also haveto I times positive I which is equal topositive 2 I squared and just like inthe last problemwe want to replace every I squared termwith a negative 1 because once again weknow that I squared is equal to negative1 so I'm going to erase both I squaredterms and replace them with a negative 1so now let's simplify this as much aspossible I'm going to start with thenumerator on the left of the numeratorwe have a positive 12 and in the middlewe have two like terms we have a 4i andwe have a 6i 4 plus 6 is equal to 10 sowe have a positive 10 I and on the rightwe have a positive 2 times a negative 1which is equal to negative 2 and in thedenominator we have a 9 on the left andour positive 3i and our negative 3icancel each other out and so we got ridof our I terms and on the right we havea negative and times a negative 1 whichis equal to positive 1 so now notice howwe have no more eye terms in ourdenominator which was what we wanted todo that's why we multiplied by theconjugate so now we got rid of the eyeterms and we just need to simplify justa little bit further in the numerator westill have two like terms we have a 12and a negative 2 12 minus 2 is equal to10 and we still have our positive 10 Iterm and in the denominator we have 9plus 1 which is also equal to 10 and atthis point sometimes you can be finishedbut with this particular problem we canstill factornotice how in our numerator we have twoterms that both have a 10 in common soI'm going to factor out a 10 I'm in thenumerator and we're left with a 1 plus Ion the inside and in the denominator westill have our 10 and now the 10 in thenumerator and the denominator canceleach other outand we're left with one plus I as oursolution so I hope this gave you abetter idea on how to multiply anddivide complex numbers in my next videoI'm going to be making many moreexamples of similar problems as this sostay tuned and I really hope that you'reenjoying these and I will see you in mynext one
