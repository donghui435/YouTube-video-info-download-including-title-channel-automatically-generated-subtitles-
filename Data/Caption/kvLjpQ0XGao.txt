today and welcome to the text mathChannel one of them be having a look atin this video is how to multiply anynumber it all really really fast we onlyup to three digits but this could beexpanded our you know to basically anytype of number you want evenridiculously big ones so I want to giveyou a question to start off with and I'mgoing to go over the pattern which I'vebeen looking at in other videos on howto do this by the way if you haven'tseen my other videos I recommend it'sprobably a big hand if you wish to getonto this one to go through a couple ofthose first but you don't necessarilyneed it depends that quick you are onthe uptake anyway the question I'm goingto give you is this one 102 times 231and I'll give youI reckon about five seconds to do thatready set goall right now here you got the answer oftwenty-three thousand five hundred andsixty-two really really well done if notI'll just go through really reallyquickly how to do these so George somedots up on the right of the screen herejust to go through and show you thepattern which I'll be using I only usespattern again and again so the firstthing I did was to get my answer is Iwent to x one so I multiplied these twonumbers here and I've got the answer oftwo okay the very next thing I did isI'll get rid of that the next thing Idid is I multiplied one times nothingand three times two so I multipliedthese two numbers okay and so one timesnothing is nothingthree times two is six so up with thatanswer down okay I'll get rid of therethat particular one I'll get on to thenext numberI went one x 1 to x 2 and three timesnothing so this one looks like this okayso 1 times 1 is 1 2 times 2 is 4 3 timesnothing is nothingadd all these together I get the answerof 5 all right we're halfway through thenext question I did for the next part ofmy question I did now only want tomultiplying these two numbers so nothingtimes 2 3 times 1 nothing plus 3 givesme a 3and then last of all that leaves me thevery last number and the two numberswhich I multiply at these two okay sotwo times one and the answer is twothere's my answertwenty-three thousand five hundred andsixty two so hopefully you see thispattern here okay where we start offwhen we multiply these numbers and we'reworking with these numbers then whenworking with all three and now we'vesort of moved over this sideand then when we've done to these twonumbers sort of like I guess almost I'mslightly going up and over a hill orsomething like this okay you're shootingacross hopefully you see this patternI've had some really really handypattern when you can do it good on youyou should be able to do lots and lotsof questions because it leads us on tothe next type of question which I put onnow okay so 306 times 24 now what you'regoing to notice straight away it'sreally really hard to stick to theseparticular patterns here because all ofa sudden we're not dealing with threeversus three things that okay this is afeeling like that but you can make it dothat and there's very very simple trickbut on doing it put make this numberhere a zero I look at that straight awayyou can do the same pattern so let's dothese numbers first six four is 24 so weput the four down but carry the two fornothing is nothingsix two to 12 plus two there's anotherfor 14 carry the 1 3 times 2 for 4 times3 is 12 6 times nothing is nothingtwo times nothing is nothing so 12 plusis 1 here is 13 carry the 1 3 2 is a sixnothing times nothing okay so 6 plusthis one here is 7 and then three timesnothing is nothing I won't bother putthat in there's their answer 7,000 344so that's how you do this little trickpretty cool right you can do this withany type of numbers you can do this withfour digit numbers five digit numbersthe possibilities are endless there'sjust the little bitty notes it's alittle trick you're using okay hopefullyyou get that if you have any questionsat all with this please let us know okaythanks for that see you next time
