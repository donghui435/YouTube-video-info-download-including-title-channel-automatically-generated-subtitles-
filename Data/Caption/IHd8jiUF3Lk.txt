- WELCOME TO A LESSON ON 
CONVERSE, CONTRAPOSITIVE,AND INVERSE OF 
AN IF-THEN STATEMENT.IT CAN BE HELPFUL TO MODEL 
A CONDITIONAL STATEMENTBY USING A VENN DIAGRAM.WE CAN DRAW A CIRCLE TO 
REPRESENT THE STATEMENT P,AS WE SEE HERE.SO IF WE'RE INSIDE P, P IS TRUE.AND IF WE'RE OUTSIDE P, 
P WOULD BE FALSE,OR WE COULD SAY "NOT P."SO FOR THE CONDITIONAL 
IF P THEN Q,THE VENN DIAGRAM WOULD HAVE 
SET P INSIDE SET Q,GUARANTEEING THAT IF P IS TRUE, 
Q WOULD ALSO BE TRUE.FOR THE CONVERSE,IF WE SWITCH THE ORDER OF THE 
HYPOTHESIS AND CONCLUSION,WE WOULD HAVE IF Q THEN P.NOTICE HOW WE ALSO SWITCHED 
THE SETS P AND Q,SO IF Q IS TRUE IT'S GUARANTEED 
THAT P WOULD ALSO BE TRUE.AND FOR THE BICONDITIONAL,
P IF AND ONLY IF Q.REMEMBER, THAT MEANS 
IF P THEN Q IS TRUE,AND IF Q THEN P IS TRUE,P AND Q WOULD ACTUALLY BE 
THE SAME SET.SO IF WE'RE IN P 
WE'RE ALSO IN Q.NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT 
THE CONVERSE, INVERSE,AND CONTRAPOSITIVE OF A GIVEN 
CONDITIONAL STATEMENT.IF WE WANT TO MODEL 
THE CONDITIONAL STATEMENT,"IF I WAKE UP EARLY 
THEN I WILL LIFT WEIGHTS,"ASSUMING THIS IS IN THE FORM 
OF IF P THEN Q,WE'D HAVE TO HAVE THE SET P 
INSIDE SET Q.SO IF WE'RE INSIDE P, 
MEANING WE WAKE UP EARLY,THEN WE'LL ALSO BE INSIDE SET Q, 
MEANING WE'LL LIFT WEIGHTS.SO FOR THE CONVERSE IF Q THEN P,WE INTERCHANGE THE HYPOTHESIS 
AND CONCLUSION.SO WE'D HAVE, "IF I LIFT WEIGHTS 
THEN I WAKE UP EARLY."LOOKING AT THE VENN DIAGRAM, 
"IF I LIFT WEIGHTS"MEANS I'M INSIDE SET Q,"THEN I WAKE UP EARLY" 
MEANS I'M INSIDE SET P.SO JUST BECAUSE I'M INSIDE Q 
DOESN'T GUARANTEETHAT I'M INSIDE P,THEREFORE THIS IS NOT LOGICALLY 
EQUIVALENT TO IF P THEN Q,WHICH MEANS IT MAY BE TRUE
OR IT MAY BE FALSE.THE CONTRAPOSITIVE WOULD BE 
IF NOT Q THEN NOT P.SO WE INTERCHANGE THE HYPOTHESIS 
AND CONCLUSIONAND ALSO NEGATE THEM.SO THE STATEMENT WOULD BE,"IF I DON'T LIFT WEIGHTS 
THEN I DON'T WAKE UP EARLY."AGAIN, LOOKING 
AT THE VENN DIAGRAM,"IF I DON'T LIFT WEIGHTS"--AND THIS MEANS I'M NOT INSIDE Q 
OR THAT I AM OUTSIDE Q--SO IF I'M OUTSIDE Q 
THEN "I DON'T WAKE UP EARLY,"WHICH MEANS I'M OUTSIDE P.SO IF I'M OUTSIDE Q I'M 
GUARANTEED TO BE OUTSIDE P,THEREFORE THIS STATEMENT 
IS LOGICALLY EQUIVALENTTO IF P THEN Q.AND THEN FOR THE INVERSE WE 
WOULD HAVE IF NOT P THEN NOT Q.SO WE NEGATE THE HYPOTHESIS 
AND CONCLUSION,SO WE'D HAVE "IF I DON'T WAKE UP 
EARLY I WILL NOT LIFT WEIGHTS."SO "IF I DON'T WAKE UP EARLY" 
MEANS I'M OUTSIDE P.SO IF I'M OUTSIDE P THEN 
"I WILL NOT LIFT WEIGHTS"OR I'M OUTSIDE Q.SO IF I'M OUTSIDE P I'M NOT 
GUARANTEED TO BE OUTSIDE Q,AND THEREFORE THIS IS NOT 
LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT TOIF P THEN Q,WHICH MEANS IT MAY BE TRUE 
OR FALSE.NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK 
AT A SECOND EXAMPLE.HERE WE WANT TO USE 
THE GIVEN STATEMENTTO DETERMINE THE CONVERSE, 
CONTRAPOSITIVE, AND INVERSE,AND THEN DETERMINE IF THE 
NEW STATEMENT IS EQUIVALENT,AND WE'LL ALSO DETERMINE 
IF IT WOULD BE TRUE OR FALSE.THE GIVEN STATEMENT IS,"IF I'M HIKING IN THE GRAND 
CANYON THEN I'M IN ARIZONA."THE GRAND CANYON IS ONE OF THE 
LARGEST TOURIST ATTRACTIONSLOCATED IN ARIZONA,AND IT'S ALSO 
A NATIONAL LANDMARK.SO IF I'M HIKING THE GRAND 
CANYON COULD BE MODELEDBY THIS CIRCLE P,AND IF I'M IN ARIZONA 
WOULD BE MODELED BY CIRCLE Q.NOTICE HOW IT'S POSSIBLE 
TO BE IN ARIZONABUT NOT BE HIKING 
THE GRAND CANYON,MEANING OUTSIDE P BUT INSIDE Q.SO THE CONVERSE IF Q THEN P 
WOULD BE,"IF I'M IN ARIZONA THEN 
I'M HIKING THE GRAND CANYON."SO IF I'M INSIDE SET Q I'M NOT 
GUARANTEED TO BE INSIDE P,AND THEREFORE THE CONVERSE IS 
NOT EQUIVALENT TO IF P THEN Q.SO IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE, 
JUST BECAUSE I'M IN ARIZONADOES NOT MEAN THAT I'M HIKING 
THE GRAND CANYON,THEREFORE THIS WOULD BE FALSE.THE CONTRAPOSITIVE IS 
IF NOT Q THEN NOT P,AND THIS WOULD BE, 
"IF I'M NOT IN ARIZONATHEN I'M NOT HIKING 
THE GRAND CANYON.""IF I'M NOT IN ARIZONA" 
WOULD MEAN THAT I'M OUTSIDE Q,AND IF I'M OUTSIDE Q 
I'M GUARANTEED TO BE OUTSIDE P,THEREFORE THE CONTRAPOSITIVE 
IS LOGICALLY EQUIVALENT TOIF P THEN Q,THEREFORE THIS IS GUARANTEED 
TO BE TRUE.THE INVERSE WOULD BE 
IF NOT P THEN NOT Q.SO "IF I'M NOT HIKING 
THE GRAND CANYONTHEN I'M NOT IN ARIZONA."IF I'M NOT HIKING 
THE GRAND CANYON,THAT WOULD MEAN I'M OUTSIDE P.SO IF I'M OUTSIDE PTHEN "I'M NOT IN ARIZONA" 
WOULD BE OUTSIDE Q.WELL, JUST BECAUSE I'M OUTSIDE 
P DOESN'T MEAN I'M OUTSIDE Q.SO THIS IS NOT LOGICALLY 
EQUIVALENT TO IF P THEN Q.FOR THIS SPECIFIC CASE,"IF I'M NOT HIKING THE GRAND 
CANYON THEN I'M NOT IN ARIZONA"WOULD BE FALSEBECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER 
PLACES TO BE IN ARIZONAOTHER THAN THE GRAND CANYON.FOR EXAMPLE, IF I'M IN PHOENIX 
I'M NOT HIKING THE GRAND CANYONBUT I AM IN ARIZONA.AND JUST IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T 
SEEN THE GRAND CANYON BEFORE,HERE'S A NICE PICTURE OF IT.AND TO HIKE TO THE BOTTOM 
AND BACK UPTAKES MOST PEOPLE 
THE ENTIRE DAY.I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS VIDEO 
HELPFUL.THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
