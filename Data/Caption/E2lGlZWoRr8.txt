so in this in this case what we have isan isosceles trapezoid and what they'reasking us to do is to find all themissing term or all the missing linksand all the missing angles so theimportant thing about an isoscelestrapezoid we know that and since it's atrapezoid we have one set of parallelsides and those are going to be ourbases right and it's obvious you can seethat these are going to be our bases notthese two as these are like pointing inand they obviously will intersect if youextended their sides so we have one setof parallel sides and that's alsoimportant about an isosceles trapezoidis remember opposite sides are congruentright you have one pair of your oppositeside so therefore at that side iscongruent with that side so if thelength of KN is 4 then we know that thelength of L M also has to be rightisosceles trapezoid have oppositecongruent sides as well as oppositecongruent angles 3 so what that means isthis angle is congruent to that angleright as well as this angle is congruentto that angle ok now there's a couplethings for you guys to kind of noteabout this as far as looking into as faras looking into the sides and everythingwith this so first of all if since theseare opposites right of each other ifthat's 32 degrees let me get a differentmarker if that's 32 then this is goingto be 32 if that's 17 degrees then thisis going to be 17 degrees all right wecan also use the idea of alternateinterior angles meaning the fact ofsense these are parallel lines right andwe have this line here that's atransversal if that's 17 degrees byapplying of alternate interior angles weknow that that's 17 degreesokay and if that's 17бу then we also knowthat this is going to be 17 degrees okaynow another ways to exact what's wrongare you writing this down further nowthe what was nice about oh it's niceabout like rectangles and what's niceabout rectangles and so far we alwaysknew they're you know going through toadd up to alternate interior sides youknow that they're going to be onsupplementary rightbut one thing we notice is if we look atthese two sides we could say well youknow what is one thing we know about aquadrilateral and you don't always haveto be thinking about things thing if weknow everything about a quadrilateral wecould say that these two angles 32 and17 is going to be 49 but what I couldsay is all these angles are going to addup for a quadrilateral to how manydegreeshow many greens do we add up for atriangle which has three sides 180 aquadrilateral has four sides so all theangles add up to 360 so one thing Icould even write guys are just thinkingI could say 32 plus 17 plus 17 plus 32plus X plus 17 plus 17 plus x equals 360alright you could add up all thoseCamela could you put that face down inyour desk pleasethank you so now if I kind of add what Ihave here 17 plus 17 is 34 that's 34 soyou could say 34 34 and that's going tobe awesomeit's going to be 64 so therefore I have68 plus 64 which would be a hundred andthirty-twoplus X and X which is two x equals 360subtract 132 so now I have two x equals228 all rightdivided by two x equals 114 thereforeyou can see that these angles right herefor X is going to be 114 degrees okaybecause we know parallelogramsconsecutive angles add up to 180 butthat doesn't have to be the case withour trap site okay and there we gothat's it okay guys
