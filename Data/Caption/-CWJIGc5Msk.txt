in this video I'm going to be workingout an area problem where we're findingthe area between two curves that end upcrossing so our problem here is going tobe find the area bounded by y equals xsquared and y equals 2 minus x squaredon that closed interval from 0 to 2now first recommendation here would beto do a rough sketch of what this isgoing to look like so that we can kindof get an idea of which one's our tablecurve which one's our bottom curve thatsort of thing okay so we've got y equalsx squared it's gonna be a standardupright parabola with that vertex at theorigin so something that looks aboutlike thatI am only in the first quadrant herebecause my closed interval interval wasfrom 0 to 2 so I don't have to worryabout anyplace else looking at thisupside-down parabola here going throughtwo let's just say this would be abouttwo up here okay so there's our y equalstwo minus x squared all right now I'm onthe closed interval from zero to twolet's just guess maybe that 2 is rightthere I mean so we have an imaginaryboundary that would be right there okayso my two areas that are enclosed bythose curves are that one and this oneover here now looking at this okay we'regoing to be concerned with the point atwhich they cross at right here andnoticing if I put in a representativerectangle alright just so that we cansee what we're doing here all right thistop curve - bottom curve over here inthis section the top curve is 2 minus xsquared the bottom curve is the xsquared curve all right but over hereafter the point at which they cross okayusing that representative rectangleright there my top curve now on thissection is x squared the bottom curve is2 minus x squared ok so looks like we'regoing to have to set up two integralsI'm going to run the first one 1 from 0to whatever that intersection point isI'll run the second integral from 1- then alright so the first thing weneed to do is find that intersectionpoint so points of intersection aregonna be found by sending those twocurves equal to each other okay so the 2minus x squared is going to be equal tothe x squared all right I can add xsquared to both sides so two equals twox squared divide both sides by 2 1equals x squared so that's going to giveme x equal plus or minus one I'm onlyconcerned with the positive 1 herebecause this is where they're going tointersect here since I'm on that closedinterval from 0 to 2 so thatintersection point is 1 so then when Igo to set up the two integrals I'm gonnago left to right 0 to 1 on my firstintegral and top curve there is going tobe 2 minus x squared minus the bottomcurve which is x squared DX then I'mgoing to want to add to that theintegral for the second section here theintegral from 1 to 2 of top curve hereis x squared minus bottom curve here's abinomial so we want to make sure andinclude those parentheses 2 minus xsquared DX alright so there is theintegral that will work for us addingtwo separate integrals because of theway those curves cross now let's do somesimplifying here we're still going to beintegrating from 0 to 1 if I simplifythis I'll have 2 minus 2 x squared DXand then on the second one and a gradingfrom 1 to 2 here simplifying this oneI'll have a 2 x squared minus 2 allright both of these now at this pointit's going to be straight integration isgoing to integrate pretty simply sointegrating 2 that'll go to Xintegrating this 2x squared I've got toadd 1 that'll make it an X to the 3rdand divide by that 3 so I'll have aminustwo thirds X to the third and we will beevaluating that from zero to one nowthis integration are going to be theexact same integrations that I had overhere so this will go to the two thirds Xto the third and then minus this will goto the two x but this time I'll beevaluating from one to two all rightfrom here on out it is straightarithmetic you can hit pause see if youcan do it by hand and come up with thesame answer I get I will go ahead andvery quickly finish this out pluggingone in I'm gonna have two minus twothirdsall right then plugging in zero that'sjust going to be a zero minus zerothat's not gonna give us anything theplus sign right thereplugging in 2 here 2 to the third timesanother two is going to be a 16 thirdsplugging two in here will be a four andthen plugging in one will give me a twothirds minus two right there okay thisone is 4/3 minus zero here gettingcommon denominators here will give meanother 4/3 and then that's going to beminus a negative so it'll be positiveanother 4/3 that's gonna give me a totalof like 12 thirds which gives me anoverall area between these two curvesbeing at 4 okay so a lot of arithmeticthere at the end the point of the videobeing if you've got two curves that endup crossing each other then you're goingto have to pay attention and figure outwhich ones on top which ones on bottomand probably break that up into twointegrals every time so that you're ableto find that area between those twocurves so definitely thanks for watchingand don't forget to subscribe to thechannel Thanks
