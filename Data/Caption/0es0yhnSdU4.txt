I'd like you to draw this diagram twicebecause I'm going to do this questiontwice and I'll show you what so enjoyyourself this kind of upside down llshape draw me a pair of them and put allof the measurements that they provideyou can put the ballthere is always ok now i know i knowpeople are not always fans androiddiagrams which honestly makes me a bitsad those diagrams are so awesome theypacked so much information into such asmall space I think you're kind ofkidding yourself to try and do thesequestions accurately without diagrams soif you draw them there I'm going to dothis two different ways and we're goingto give them names after we've done itbut if you have another color this wouldbe enormous news so the opposite area Iwant to work out the area of thisl-shaped type object so here's methodnumber one what I'm going to do first isI see that this we don't shave is kindof made up of two rectangles that arejammed together yeah now you can figureout a couple of different ways but I'mgoing to put a line here like so so Ihave a wide rectangle at a tallrectangle and in order to describe themi want to give them names becausethey're both rectangles i can save thisrectangle that rectangle so i'm going tocall this one are 14 rectangle one andi'm going to call this one are two fromrectangle to you can need them anythingyou might visit your names but i thinkthat way it's pretty unambiguous if youhave trailers you come to you want to doetc what everyone so now that I've gotsome areas there's again I'm just goingto wait them out one at a time so thearea of our one well what's the formulafor the area of a rectangle length hasbread right so i have a leg p that's 3i'll write that down first I don't havea breath that's been actually pull ontothe diagram for me so I kind of have towork it out it's this distance here andit's seven how did you work out that itwas sevengood so you've got this whole egg 10 andyou're taking away the three that getshold you down here right so 3573 bysevens not hard so this is 21 squarecentimeters and I'm going to rinse andrepeat for the second rectangle thisclaim because of the way I've chopped itup I actually do have a link the breadthof rectangle too so i'm just going towrite three by 43o 14 i think is 50 4242espresso beans okay so you've got allyour pieces this is a nice simple one tobegin with there's only two so I've donenow i'm going to say therefore the totalarea equals that looks like 63 squarecentimeters and you're done okay so thisis not complicated as you can see youprobably could have worked out this dullare like directly with just one equationbut I'm going to say as you get two morecomplicated shapes having be able tobreak them up and go through themsystematically becomes more and more andtheir teams too so that's how I did itthe first way we'll give that a name ina minute go to the second instance thatyou're drawing this Psalm rectangle Ibegin going to put a dotted line herebut I'm going to do a different one I'mgoing to crawl my dotted lines over hereon what okay so remember how we sentover this is two rectangles that havebeen added onto a jumper you can alsothink of it as our big rectangle we'rein a smaller rectangle cut out of ityeah so again if I can work out the bigone and then work out a small one then Ijust find a dress so I'm going to callthe big one of our one is how I'm goingto she's insane labels again you couldcall them anything you like you calledbig R & bill r 1 and I'm gonna call thisone too okay what's the area of thisbig rectangle yeah 100 point which ofcourse trucks from 10 x 14 so I'm justgoing to pocket that away and when Iwork out this smaller rectangle I've gotto do what I did before and say oh thisis seven what's this distance this is 14take away three yeah so 11 so I'm goingto say seven times 11 that's 77 squaresin now importantly because I'mcombining these areas in different waysI'm not going to add them like I didover here i'm going to subtract them soi'm going to do 140 take away 77 butagain because it's still the same shapeand you can confirm this on yourcalculator you will still get asixty-three percent of it ok so let'sgive these things some names here I wasadding up rectangles and here I wassubtracted rectangles so I like to callthis one by addition and I like to callthis one no prizes for guessing bysubtraction I will point out as welldepending on the shape that you haveright sometimes you can combine thesedifferent methods let's just have a lookover here for example you have a look atthis one that's just a little bit TV ohyeah stop live it up I'll have a look atthis shape for a second and think abouthow you might slice your son how wouldyou go about doing it and rememberthere's lots of different ways just likeI showed you over you there's lots ofdifferent ways that are equally validwhich way will you choose ok so howwould I do it how would you like to doit if I just said let's add things upyeah ready what do you wanna suggestsomething elseokay so how would you like me to sliceit up bye-bye you mean this one yep goodwhich they don't think you made this oneoh yes sorry sorry it's funny that itlooks okay okay is that what you meantyeah so here you can work out right thisone be five by eight work out that iswhat are we going to get here what'sthis distance have a look careful lookslike 3 plus 9 yeah so that's 12 goingthis way what's this distance yeah it's10 plus 5 15 and you already know thisone is this is 10 by nine so doing thisa little bit quickly i guess i would saythe total area is equal to all right westarted with this guy 5 by 8 i'm goingto add this big one here which is whatis it again 12 5 15 and then i'm goingto subtract 10 butter and i don't knowwhat that's equal to but i'm prettyconfident that will give you the rightanswer clearly you could divide updifferent ways I mean just like we putthis vertical line in here you can put avertical line in here you could slice itup whichever way you like the importantthing is you have something like thislike you've got multiple areas give themnames tell me which ones which don'tcall them this rectangle and thatrectangle or the big rectangle and thesomewhat less big rectangle and don'tdon't do that just give the leaves andif you want to but then you have toremember what shape John is and whatshapes TV is why not just only if yousay so um and then as well where youcombine them be careful and tell me theway that you combine them someone in anatom some innocent tracted actually tellme what's going on okay
