did I welcome to the tech math Channelwhat will you be able to look at in thisboat videos I'm going to be looking athow to multiply certs now surd is anirrational number which can only beexactly expressed using the root powerokay the root button over the rootsymbol so example this morally say rootswhoo okay I mean if you work that incalculator you get some irrationalnumber you get some decimal which wouldbe say one point four one four blah blahblah blah and would keep going on and onwith his non-repeating sort of ourdecimal answer yeah and so we to get themore exact answer we actually when we'redealing with AIDS we actually moreexactly right there's a square root oftwo I know some people say likecomfortably with this so um we're gonnabe looking at how to multiply these sosay I wanted to go to square root of twotimes the square root of three now I'mgonna use our couple on dawn surge toactually show you how to work these outrather than destroying a formula at youI just want to show you how this worksso I'm gonna get back to that particularquestion but the way the actual questionI want to deal with it is this one toshow you how this works so we had thesquare root of four this is not a thirdby the way because it can be solvedexactly and we're gonna multiply this byanother non Serge which is the squareroot of nine so we can actually solvethis we can take the square root of 4 is2 and the square root of 9 is 3 andwe're in at times things so 2 times 3equals 6okay and I'm just gonna put one lastthing he was this six here is the squareroot of 36 okay what you might notice isis the square root of 4 times the squareroot of 9 equals the square root of 36and 9 times 4 equals 36 okay so thisgives us a great little little rule thatwe can actually use here that does workby the way which is this one okay andthis is the rule for multiplying thirdsthe square root of I times the squareroot of N equals the square root of atimes B okay so back to our initial sortof question which was the square root of2 times the square root of 3 the answerto this is the square root of 2 times 3would you see okay so I'll give youanother one of these are you gonna seehow easy these are going to be to say Idid the square root of 3 times thesquare root of 5 okay what's this gonnabe it's gonna be equal to the squareroot of 3 times 5 which is 15 it'sreally easy right now look at the onlyother modification that you might get tothese when you get these sort ofquestions and look I'm getting most ofyou people who ever look at this I canto get this as part of some mathsquestion I don't work less likesomething like thiswell they say something like this youmight even get it where they you getthis type of question so 4 times thesquare root of 2 and we're gonnamultiply this by 3 times the square rootr7 and the way that you multiply theseit is much a same you just deal withthese numbers here first so 4 times 3 4times 3 is 12and the square root there to 12 7 is 14okay now that's Hanna multiply thirdsnext video let me making up and it'sgonna be looking at how to provide senseokay anyway I hope you find that a bighelpwe'll see a next one
